0,1980-81,Presenting the interim Budget in March this year I gave an account of the poor shape of our national economy and the magnitude of the task facing the nation.
1,1980-81,The Economic Survey presented to the House last week confirms the brief review made by me in March.
2,1980-81,"As it gives a detailed account of the present condition of the Indian economy and its problems and prospects, I shall content myself with highlighting only a few aspects in order to give the House an idea of the gravity of the economic problems faced by this Government, the action it has taken so far to solve them and the need for other measures some of which I. shall outline in the course of this speech."
3,1980-81,A fall in agricultural production of about 10 per cent and a reduction of about one per cent in industrial production were responsible for this outcome.
4,1980-81,The setback in agriculture was partly on account of the severe drought which affected large parts of the country.
5,1980-81,The decline in industrial production was mainly the result of a serious deterioration in the infrastructure.
6,1980-81,"The performance of power, coal and railway sectors was one of the most serious deficiencies m the economic scene."
7,1980-81,No doubt the drought was responsible for a decline of 2.2 per cent in hydel production but what stands out is the inability to meet increased demand through increased thermal generation despite substantial additions made to generating capacity in the past three years.
8,1980-81,"Inadequate supply of coal and its poor quality, poor maintenance, equipment damage resulting in increasing planned and unplanned outages and poor management were responsible for the decline in the percentage of thermal capacity utilisation to as low as 45 per cent."
9,1980-81,In coal again it was the same story.
10,1980-81,"Despite massive investments the production of coal and lignite in 197980 was just 106 million tonnes, marginally better than the level reached four years ago."
11,1980-81,The poor performance of DVC and the failure to maintain law and order in the coal mining areas of Bihar and Bengal contributed to the setback in coal production.
12,1980-81,At the same time coal could not be transported to thermal stations in adequate quantities because of difficulties in railway movement.
13,1980-81,In 197980 the revenue earning traffic of the Railways in terms of tonnes 1 I rise to present the regular Budget for the year 198081.
14,1980-81,The performance of the Railways in terms of tonnes originating of revenue earning traffic has been declining continuously since the peak reached in 197677.
15,1980-81,"The deficiencies in the three sectors, power, coal and railways, reinforced me another and inflicted severe damage on the national economy."
16,1980-81,"With the serious deficiencies in infrastructure it was not surprising that there was a fall in the production of major commodities like steel, cement, nonelectrical machinery, aluminium and other nonferrous metals and cotton textiles."
17,1980-81,Sugar production also fell by 28 per cent.
18,1980-81,There was a decline in capacity utilisation in industry in general.
19,1980-81,"In a situation in which aggregate supply dropped sharply, there was a steep rise in prices."
20,1980-81,In the fiscal year 197980 prices rose by 20 per cent.
21,1980-81,"In some commodities like sugar, gur, khandsari, oilseeds and edible oils the rise was particularly steep."
22,1980-81,There was also a persistent upward trend in a wide range of manufactures and intermediates owing to the low level of production.
23,1980-81,"The direct and indirect effects of the increases in the prices of crude oil and oil products also contributed to the inflationary pressures in the economy as also the long delayed, adjustments in administered prices of commodities like coal and steel."
24,1980-81,This naturally gave rise to speculative expectations and the liquidity in the system due to large expansion of money supply in the previous years aggravated the price situation.
25,1980-81,The other area in which there was a deterioration following from all these factors was the balance of payments.
26,1980-81,It is true that our overall foreign exchange reserves declined by only Rs 56 crores in 197980 but the trend in the various forces operating m the balance of payments has been reversed perceptibly.
27,1980-81,Export growth in value terms has only been 8 per cent or so which means there was hardly any growth in terms of volume as world inflation has proceeded at about 10 per cent in 197980.
28,1980-81,On the other hand imports have increased by about 25 per cent principally on account of increased oil bill because of steep rise in the prices of oil and oil products and the consequential impact on other imports such as fertilizer.
29,1980-81,"The result is that the trade gap in 197980 was Rs 2232 crores, double the size of the trade deficit in 197879."
30,1980-81,This has led to a deficit on the current account.
31,1980-81,The rate of growth of remittances which has in the recent past turned the trade deficit into a surplus on current account also decelerated in 197980.
32,1980-81,Such a dismal economic situation was to a large extent the result of the policies  or should I say lack of policies  of the previous Government.
33,1980-81,"For instance, vacillations in sugar policy contributed to a fall in the area under sugarcane, decline in sugar production and the frittering away of large stocks of sugar carried over from previous seasons through releases which could not be sustained over a period."
34,1980-81,"Had they pursued a more responsible policy on sugar, we would not have been in the unenviable position of having to import sugar for domestic consumption."
35,1980-81,"In infrastructure the lack of coordinated policy in the three sectors of coal, transport and power was responsible for their unsatisfactory performance."
36,1980-81,The large Budget deficit of Rs 2700 crores in an economy flush with liquidity and a policy of sweeping taxation m articles of common consumption in a situation of declining production were responsible for the spurt in prices.
37,1980-81,"Finally, the lack of adequate emphasis on export promotion was partially responsible for the reversal of the trend in our balance of payments."
38,1980-81,What is important now is to devise ways and means to arrest the deterioration and set the economy on the path of stability and growth.
39,1980-81,"The fact that we have a Government which enjoys the confidence of the people and is decisive should make a qualitative difference; as also the fact that there will be much greater cooperation between the Centre and the States, now that our party has been so enthusiastically returned in the State elections."
40,1980-81,"At the end of May, 1980, we still have food stocks of about 18 million tonnes owing to our earlier foresight."
41,1980-81,"Foreign exchange reserves stood at Rs 4890 crores as on May 30, 1980."
42,1980-81,These elements of strength will be effectively utilised to improve the situation.
43,1980-81,But the House should realise that the magnitude and complexity of the.
44,1980-81,"However, the problems are so urgent that we shall tackle them with determination and with the cooperation of all sections of our people."
45,1980-81,Since it came to power this Government has taken a number of steps to correct the deficiencies in the economic system.
46,1980-81,Since restoration of infrastructure brooked no delay Government constituted a Cabinet Committee on infrastructure under my Chairmanship to monitor the situation continuously.
47,1980-81,As power shortages have been an impediment to the growth of production the Committee has devoted a good deal of attention to rectifying the power situation.
48,1980-81,"The Committee wanted to ensure that thermal generation did not suffer for lack of coal and, therefore, decided to make more wagons available for loading coal to thermal stations."
49,1980-81,"As a result the number of wagons loaded daily with coal for thermal stations has gone up from 2900 in January to 3200 in May, 1980."
50,1980-81,Coastal shipping has been revived to supplement movement of coal by rail and is expected to achieve progressively a target of one lakh tonnes per month to meet the needs of western and southern regions.
51,1980-81,"Due to a number of steps taken coal production increased by 9.4 lakh tonnes in April, and 10.4 lakh tonnes in May, 1980 as compared with April and May, 1979."
52,1980-81,There has been a dramatic improvement in the port situation.
53,1980-81,"The number of ships waiting for a berth in Bombay, Calcutta and Madras has come down sharply by May, 1980."
54,1980-81,A good indicator of the improvement in port conditions is the removal of the congestion surcharge for major ports including Bombay and Calcutta from April 1980.
55,1980-81,"As the rainfall during the period October, 1979 to May, 1980 was also deficient causing drought conditions to continue in many States affecting 220 million population, the present Government, immediately after assuming office, mounted relief operations on a massive scale."
56,1980-81,Central teams were deputed to these and other States and an allocation of Rs 150 crores was made for drought relief.
57,1980-81,More than 10 lakh destitutes were provided free food.
58,1980-81,"In addition, about 65 lakh persons were employed daily under the special Food for Work Programme."
59,1980-81,"Government has decided to continue this programme till the end of September, 1980."
60,1980-81,"The existing subsidy on agricultural inputs, including nitrogenous fertilizers, to small and marginal farmers in the monocropped drought affected areas where no rabi crops could be grown has also been extended till the end of March,1981."
61,1980-81,A 12point programme of drought management which provides the basic framework and approach for fighting the drought has been evolved and recommended to the States.
62,1980-81,A large number of rigs have been deployed for sinking wells and a significant percentage of wells bored has proved successful.
63,1980-81,"These steps are expected to bring about permanent improvements in availability of drinking water in the drought affected, States."
64,1980-81,"The demand for petroleum products, particularly diesel, increased during the last few months owing to a number of circumstances including the drought."
65,1980-81,"The problem was compounded by almost total cessation of supplies from January onwards from the four refineries dependent on Assam crude which between them normally produce around 350,000 tonnes of petroleum products per month."
66,1980-81,The situation was tackled with the utmost vigour.
67,1980-81,"Firstly, the maximum quantities of diesel and kerosene were imported between January and April, 1980, 6.2 lakh tonnes of kerosene and 1.1 million tonnes of diesel oil were imported as compared with 4. 7 lakh tonnes and 4.8 lakh tonnes respectively in JanuaryApril 1979."
68,1980-81,"Secondly, the movement of these commodities was speeded pp by all available means."
69,1980-81,The result has been an increase in the level of supplies amounting to 10 per cent compared with the corresponding months in 1979 and avoidance of a possible adverse effect on rabi production due to a diesel shortage.
70,1980-81,With regard to prices Government has taken a number of important steps.
71,1980-81,The coverage of the public distribution system has been widened.
72,1980-81,With regard to edible oils not only has Government undertaken adequate imports but it has also made arrangements to see that a sizable portion of these imports go into direct consumption.
73,1980-81,It is hoped that about 3 lakh tonnes of imported oil will go into direct consumption through the public distribution system and cooperatives.
74,1980-81,"In sugar, Government has activated the disrupted dual pricing system."
75,1980-81,"In keeping with our developmental thrust towards the poorest, the banks have been asked to ensure that a significant proportion of the enlarged priority sector credit will flow to the beneficiaries of the 20Point Economic Programme, which is 4 being revitalised."
76,1980-81,"To further strengthen the linkage between block level development activities and the bank’s credit programmes, the banks have been asked to open by the end of the year, branches at all unbanked block headquarters."
77,1980-81,Honourable Members are aware of the critical role played by our exports in our developmental effort.
78,1980-81,"Therefore, the Government had, over the years, endeavoured to provide all facilities and full encouragement to export promotion efforts."
79,1980-81,"The management of credit and investment finance for export promotion in an increasingly competitive international market is, however, becoming more and more complex."
80,1980-81,There is thus a need for a specialised institution which will become a focal point for all aspects of export credit and which will devote concentrated attention to the needs of the exporting community.
81,1980-81,"Government has, accordingly, decided to set up an Exportimport Bank, to assist the financing of our international trade."
82,1980-81,We hope this specialised institution will give the desired boost to our export promotion efforts.
83,1980-81,In the light of the problems currently facing the economy the tasks to be accomplished are clear enough.
84,1980-81,"As there is a great deal of inflationary potential in the economy, the prime objective of our policy will be to achieve price stability."
85,1980-81,This will have to be done through an increase in aggregate supply and a moderation of aggregate demand.
86,1980-81,"Therefore, we intend to continue our efforts to improve the working of the infrastructure and to augment available facilities with investment wherever necessary."
87,1980-81,"Secondly, the accent will be on utilising existing capacity more effectively, without slackening efforts to increase capacity, to augment supplies of vital commodities like steel, cement, aluminium and fetilizers."
88,1980-81,"This will simultaneously increase production and employment, reduce the need for imports and benefit revenue."
89,1980-81,"With regard to demand management, we shall have to pursue a policy of linking bank credit expansion to productive and priority purposes and check the diversion of funds to speculative ends."
90,1980-81,We will also have to pursue an interest rate policy which will help in the abatement of inflationary pressures without hurting productive activity.
91,1980-81,At the same time profiteers and hoarders intent on exploiting current shortages for personal gain will have to be dealt with sternly.
92,1980-81,Smuggling will have to be countered through Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act and other means.
93,1980-81,"Since there is a great deal of liquidity in the system, there is an obvious need to minimise the growth of money supply by keeping the budget deficit at a much lower level than in 197980."
94,1980-81,"This will require a fiscal policy which will reduce wasteful and unnecessary expenditure, invest resources in increasing the economy’s production potential and maximise the revenue potential of the existing tax system."
95,1980-81,In view of deterioration in our balance of payments we will have to emphasise the promotion of exports to a far greater extent than has been done in the past three years.
96,1980-81,"At the same time, it is necessary to minimise the growth of imports 5 through a much more energetic policy for augmenting domestic production in areas like edible oils, steel, cement, fertilizers, oil and oil products."
97,1980-81,Government also intends to pursue policies which will encourage savings and investment in the economy.
98,1980-81,"Since 1971, a convertibility clause is being inserted in agreements governing financial assistance to industrial units by public financial institutions."
99,1980-81,It has been repeatedly represented by industry that the rigours of the convertibility clause are inhibiting investment.
100,1980-81,Government has carefully considered the matter and has decided that the policy guidelines for convertibility clause be modified on the following lines: a The mandatory insertion of convertibility clause will in future apply to financial assistance exceeding Rs 1 crore instead of Rs 50 lakhs prescribed at present.
101,1980-81,The financial institutions should hereafter exercise the conversion option in such a way that they do not acquire more than 40 per cent of the share capital of an existing concern.
102,1980-81,"However, in case of persistent default in repayment of loans or mismanagement of an assisted company or continuous closure of an industrial unit of a company producing goods and services essential to the community, the financial institutions might, with the concurrence of Government, exercise their conversion option in such a way that their shareholding can go up to 51 per cent or above."
103,1980-81,"Under the existing soft loan scheme for modernisation of jute, cotton textiles, cement, sugar and certain engineering industries, no convertibility clause is being inserted at present."
104,1980-81,This exemption is being extended to assistance for modernisation in any industry and for rehabilitation of sick units.
105,1980-81,Government hopes these policy changes would remove the present inhibitions and encourage fresh investment in and modernisation of industry.
106,1980-81,THE PLAN AND BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 198081 28.
107,1980-81,In our preoccupation with the immediate problems of economic management we should not lose sight of the need to build up the growth potential of the economy over the medium term.
108,1980-81,"If we do not do so, the shortterm difficulties will only grow further."
109,1980-81,The reconstituted Planning Commission will present the new programmes and priorities when the Plan is formulated by the end of this year.
110,1980-81,But meanwhile a Plan for the year 198081 has been formulated which will be dovetailed into the Sixth Plan later.
111,1980-81,The broad objective of the Plan would be to achieve a higher growth rate of 5 per cent per annum.
112,1980-81,The annual Plan for 198081 seeks to revive and restore the health of the economy and accelerate the pace of growth and employment generation.
113,1980-81,"Though the priorities laid down by the earlier Government are not acceptable to us, we have recognised that ongoing projects should be fully provided for."
114,1980-81,"Within the room for manoeuvrability permitted by this consideration, we have effected changes in plan 6 provisions or provided for new programmes so as to give a reorientation to the Plan in the desired direction."
115,1980-81,The new Planning Commission has made a quick review of Plan programmes and priorities.
116,1980-81,"I am glad to announce that in the light of this review the annual Plan outlay for 198081 of the Centre is being raised to Rs 7,340 crores, an increase of Rs 767 crores over the outlay in the interim Budget; compared with last year’s original outlay it is higher by 14.5 per cent."
117,1980-81,"It will be financed by a budgetary provision of Rs 5,322 crores and internal and other resources of public sector undertakings of Rs 2,018 crores."
118,1980-81,"A provision of Rs 3,094 crores has been made for Central assistance to the outlay on States’ Plans, Union territories’ Plans and subplans of hills and tribal areas, special component plans for the scheduled castes, schemes of the North Eastern Council, Rural Electrification Corporation and natural calamities."
119,1980-81,"Inclusive of their own resources their Plan outlay will be Rs 7,253 crores as against an outlay of Rs 6,099 crores in 197980."
120,1980-81,"Altogether the total Plan outlay of the Centre, States, Union territories, schemes of North Eastern Council, etc., would amount to Rs 14,593 crores in 198081 as compared with Rs 12,511 crores in 197980  a step up of 16.8 per cent."
121,1980-81,It is this Government’s firm belief that economic growth could be accelerated and its fruits widely shared only if employment opportunities in rural areas are significantly augmented.
122,1980-81,Development will have no meaning to the vast majority of our people if the poor in the rural areas are not able to secure a livelihood through satisfactory productive work.
123,1980-81,"As an integral part of the new Plan, we have therefore, decided to launch a massive National Rural Employment Programme based on a strategy which will seek to blend opportunities for selfhelp and optimum utilisation of available local resources."
124,1980-81,Such a programme will go a long way towards revitalising the rural economy and developing the infrastructure facilities so essential to the life of the community.
125,1980-81,The Food for Work Programme initiated by us in 1977 has an important part to play in this regard.
126,1980-81,But in the last two years this programme has displayed certain cardinal weaknesses.
127,1980-81,"In many cases, no attempts have been made to develop an inventory of projects which will meet not only the local needs but also fit in with the overall national priorities."
128,1980-81,There was also no firm indication of annual allocation of foodgrains.
129,1980-81,The programme thus in effect continued on an ad hoc basis.
130,1980-81,No arrangements were also made for financing the cash component of the works programme undertaken by the State Governments with the help of foodgrains allocated to them.
131,1980-81,The result was that they could not undertake works which could have led to the creation of durable assets and the building up of productive potential of the areas concerned.
132,1980-81,"In the new National Rural Employment Programme, States will receive assistance not only in the form of foodgrains but also cash assistance so as to enable 7 them to undertake truly productive works of lasting benefit."
133,1980-81,The Budget estimates which have been presented to the House provide Rs 340 crores in 198081 for this programme.
134,1980-81,"It is estimated that the programme, if properly implemented, could generate 850 to 900 million man days of additional employment."
135,1980-81,"Some part of the provision for this scheme would be specifically earmarked for’ high priority programmes like social forestry, fuel plantation, rural community housing and water supply and nutrition."
136,1980-81,Rs 10 crores have been provided for the Food for Nutrition Programme.
137,1980-81,The process of economic growth will be incomplete unless the benefits of such growth reach the weakest sections of society.
138,1980-81,"Therefore, the improvement of the socioeconomic conditions of the scheduled castes should be a major element of our strategy of development."
139,1980-81,Comprehensive special component plans for the scheduled castes will have to be drawn up with the objective of earmarking outlays in all relevant sectors in proportion to the scheduled caste population in each State.
140,1980-81,Such outlays are to be utilised for helping the scheduled caste families to acquire income generating assets and relevant skills for the betterment of their living conditions.
141,1980-81,The Budget breaks new ground by providing for a special central assistance of Rs 100 crores to the States to act as a catalyst in the generation of more funds from other sources including financial institutions.
142,1980-81,This will enable the authorities to provide as a package all the inputs needed in an integrated programme of promotion of the socioeconomic condition of scheduled castes.
143,1980-81,A provision for Central assistance of Rs 70 crores has been made for the development of tribal people and areas under the Tribal subplan.
144,1980-81,"Additional pockets with a population of 10,000 and having at least 50 per cent tribal concentration will be identified, thus bringing nearly 75 per cent of the tribal population in eighteen States and Union territories within the Tribal subplan."
145,1980-81,"Greater emphasis will, be laid on selected programmes which can benefit the tribal families."
146,1980-81,A provision of about Rs 50 crores has been made in the annual Plan for 1980 81 for providing house sites for the landless and weaker sections as part of the 20Point Economic Programme.
147,1980-81,The Rural HousingcumHut Construction Scheme for landless workers being operated under the revised Minimum Needs Programme provides not only house sites but also assistance for the construction of huts.
148,1980-81,This provision will be supplemented under the National Rural Employment Programme which will cover community housing projects in rural areas.
149,1980-81,Nearly 8 lakh landless families are expected to benefit under this scheme.
150,1980-81,"Since India lives in its villages and nearly 70 per cent of its population derives its livelihood from agriculture, the prosperity of the country depends upon the modernisation of agriculture."
151,1980-81,The year 1979~80 is a grim reminder of the importance of the performance of agriculture to the development of the Indian economy.
152,1980-81,"The Plan outlay on agriculture and rural development in the current year is being increased to Rs 2,247 crores from Rs 1,811 crores in 1979 80."
153,1980-81,"This includes the provision in the 8 Central Plan of Rs 158 crores for Small Farmers Development Agency, Drought Prone Areas Programme, integrated Rural Development Programme, etc. ;"
154,1980-81,"Rs 32 crores for better exploitation of inland and marine fish potential; Rs 54 crores for Operation Flood II Project; Rs 59 crores for schemes of agricultural research and education oriented towards improving agricultural productivity through better seeds, better agronomic practices, better water management and better use of fertilizers and other essential inputs; and Rs 10 crores to increase the production of oilseeds to reach a target of 12 million tonnes."
155,1980-81,The current levels of international prices of oil and oil products have highlighted the importance of other fuels.
156,1980-81,Forests can play an important part in providing one such fuel.
157,1980-81,"AS forests in India have suffered fast destruction by people in their search for fuel, it is essential that people’s participation in the development of forests is secured on an urgent basis."
158,1980-81,Social forestry in villages will besides meeting the energy requirements of the people also provide additional employment.
159,1980-81,The raising of fuel and fodder is proposed to be made a part of Minimum Needs Programme and it will receive high priority in the National Rural Employment Programme.
160,1980-81,We have to press on with the task of increasing the area under Irrigation to avoid fluctuations in production and to increase productivity.
161,1980-81,"Therefore, the outlay on major and medium irrigation projects including flood control for 1980 81 is being stepped up to Rs 1380 crores from Rs 1258 crores last year."
162,1980-81,The minor irrigation programme would continue to receive special attention and an outlay of Rs 266 crores has been made for this purpose.
163,1980-81,This provision will be supplemented by large financial support from the Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation.
164,1980-81,The additional irrigation potential resulting from all this expenditure is expected to be 2.5 million hectares.
165,1980-81,Clean and safe drinking water is essential for improvement of the quality of life in rural areas.
166,1980-81,The Central Plan for 1980 81 provides an outlay of Rs 100 crores as against Rs 80 crores in 1979 80.
167,1980-81,"Inclusive of the provisions in the States’ Plans, a total sum of Rs 294 crores will be available for this vital programme."
168,1980-81,"It is expected that by the end of the current year, 35,000 additional villages identified as problem villages will be having protected water supply arrangements."
169,1980-81,A part of the outlay has been earmarked for rigs to be supplied to States for boring wells in drought affected areas.
170,1980-81,An additional sum of about Rs 40 crores has been allocated in the current year to the drought affected States to take up new water supply schemes and complete those already in hand.
171,1980-81,"The khadi, village and small scale industries sector has the highest employment potential next to agriculture."
172,1980-81,The outlay on this sector in the current year will be Rs 150 crores and additional production during the year is estimated at Rs 146 crores.
173,1980-81,The House will recall that the 20Point Economic Programme has particularly emphasised the development of the handloom sector in this context.
174,1980-81,"In 9 pursuance of this objective, we propose to set up a national level Handloom Development Corporation for providing a package of marketing and developmental assistance for the handloom industry."
175,1980-81,"Provision has also been made for establishing an institute of Handloom Technology in the NorthEastern region, which is well known for its exquisite handloom products."
176,1980-81,"The provision for the power sector has been raised by over 11 per cent i.e., from 11p.2466 crores in 197980 to Rs 2745 crores."
177,1980-81,The work on the four Super thermal power stations in the different regions of the country is being accelerated.
178,1980-81,Total outlay oil the rural electrification programme will be Rs 285 crores in 1980 81.
179,1980-81,"The target in 1980 81 is the energisation of 4 lakh pumpsets and the electrification of 25,000 villages."
180,1980-81,"Similarly, an outlay of Rs 473 crores is being provided in 198081 as against Rs 364 crores last year for improving the production of coal including lignite."
181,1980-81,This includes a provision of Rs 92 crores for the Neyveli Lignite Corporation.
182,1980-81,The bulk of this allocation is for the second mine project which will produce 4.5 million tonnes per annum and the second thermal power station with a generating capacity of 630 MW.
183,1980-81,A production target of 113.5 million tonnes has been set for coal for the current year as against the actual production of 106 million tonnes in 197980.
184,1980-81,In view of the impact on the balance of payments of the rising prices of oil there can be no two opinions about the urgency of developing our own oil resources.
185,1980-81,"The Plan outlay for the petroleum sector for 198081 is Rs 837 crores, Rs 215 crores more than the outlay last year."
186,1980-81,The Budget provides only Rs 99 crores out of this.
187,1980-81,This outlay is for the completion of facilities for Phase III development of Bombay High and advance action in.
188,1980-81,It also includes the expenditure required for the development of the South Bassein Gas field and the gas pipeline to the new fertilizer projects.
189,1980-81,Onshore exploratory drilling in the eastern region is to be intensified in view of the region’s higher potential for hydro carbon discoveries.
190,1980-81,The Central Plan outlay m chemicals and fertilizers is being raised to Rs 319 crores in 198081 to provide adequately for new gasbased fertilizer plants in Maharashtra and Assam.
191,1980-81,"In addition, a provision of Rs 20 crores has been made for fertilizer projects in the cooperative sector."
192,1980-81,The Central Plan also provides in the current year an outlay of Rs 803 crores for the steel sector as against Rs 600 crores last year.
193,1980-81,The outlay includes a provision of Rs 200 crores for raising the capacity of the Bokaro Steel Plant to four million tonnes per annum and an outlay of Rs 190 crores for the Bhilai Steel Plant for a similar expansion.
194,1980-81,Work on the Salem Project will proceed at the required pace with an outlay of Rs 57 crores.
195,1980-81,A substantial beginning will be made on the new Visakhapatnam Steel Plant with a provision of Rs 70 crores.
196,1980-81,The target of saleable 10 steel in the current year has been fixed at 8.76 million tonnes as against the anticipated production of 7.22 million tonnes in 197980.
197,1980-81,An outlay of Rs 130 crores is being made in 1980 81 for the mines sector.
198,1980-81,"This includes a provision of Rs 10 crores for the new east coast aluminium project, Rs 28 crores for the Malanjkhand Copper Project and Rs 19 crores for the intensification of the activities of the Geological Survey of India and the Mineral Exploration Corporation."
199,1980-81,A provision of Rs 64 crores has been made for BHEL for its continuing schemes and for the production of large size turbo generators at Hardwar and the expansion of boiler manufacturing capacity at Tiruchy. 49.
200,1980-81,"Since port congestion also has figured prominently as a constraint till recently, a provision of Rs 102 crores is being made in 198081 for developing major and minor ports."
201,1980-81,"However, only a sum of Rs 60 crores has been provided in the Budget as the rest of the expenditure is being met from internal resources of the Port Trusts."
202,1980-81,"Bombay, Madras and Cochin are being equipped to handle the anticipated increase in container traffic."
203,1980-81,A beginning has been made on the integrated development of Cochin Port.
204,1980-81,The Plan outlay for 1980 81 for the Posts & Telegraphs Department is Rs 415 crores.
205,1980-81,It is proposed to provide additional 1.75 lakh lines switching capacity and 1.7 lakh direct exchange lines and other facilities.
206,1980-81,"The number of post offices in rural, backward and hilly areas is also proposed to be increased."
207,1980-81,The norms for providing telegraph and telephone facilities in tribal areas have been further liberalised to cover areas having a population of 2500 in a group of villages within a radius of 10 kms.
208,1980-81,Provision has also been made for the expansion of manufacturing capacity for switching equipment.
209,1980-81,Family Planning programme suffered a serious set back in the past three years.
210,1980-81,"A revitalisation of this programme must constitute an important element of the new Five Year Plan, if an improvement of the living conditions of our people is our goal."
211,1980-81,A provision of Rs 250 crores is being made in 198081 for health and family welfare.
212,1980-81,"Of this, Rs 140 crores will be for family welfare."
213,1980-81,The emphasis in the family welfare programme will be on educating the people about the desirability of a small family and providing the necessary technical services on an adequate scale.
214,1980-81,"An attempt will also be made to provide improved health services in rural areas, eradicate communicable diseases and provide health education."
215,1980-81,The development problems of a poor society of 650 million people are bound to be stupendous.
216,1980-81,"For a solution of these, within a reasonable time, it will be necessary to harness the forces of science and technology."
217,1980-81,India is favourably placed with regard to the development of science and technology in that she has a large pool of scientific and technical manpower and a vast institutional infrastructure developed 11 over the last thirty years.
218,1980-81,"While our scientific institutions can help to advance the frontiers of knowledge, it is science based technology which can help to raise production and productivity."
219,1980-81,"Therefore, an outlay of Rs 116 crores has been provided in the Central Plan for 198081 for science and technology."
220,1980-81,I will now make a brief mention of a few changes in the nonPlan expenditure.
221,1980-81,"The provision for Defence expenditure is Rs 3600 crores, Rs 300 crores more than the provision made in the interim Budget."
222,1980-81,"The provision for export subsidy has been increased from Rs 330 crores to Rs 355 crores, in view of the need for a larger export effort."
223,1980-81,"Loans to State Governments, as their share of small savings collections, are being stepped up from Rs 650 crores in the interim Budget to Rs 715 crores, in view of the anticipated improvement in these collections."
224,1980-81,Short term loans to State Governments for agricultural inputs are also being increased by Rs 50 crores.
225,1980-81,"Besides, additional provision has also become necessary to meet unavoidable commitments like additional dearness allowance to Central Government employees, purchase of heavy water for atomic power plants, etc."
226,1980-81,"However, the above increases in nonPlan expenditure will be partially offset by reduction in fertilizer subsidy."
227,1980-81,The Constitution envisages provision of free legal aid by Government in order to ensure that an opportunity for securing justice is not denied to any citizen because of economic or other disabilities.
228,1980-81,"The concept of legal aid has also been dealt with by a Committee on Juridicare headed by Justice P.N. Bhagwati, whose Report dated 31st August, 1977 has been laid before Parliament."
229,1980-81,Several States have been attempting legal aid programmes.
230,1980-81,It is proposed to coordinate these schemes and also initiate suitable schemes at the Centre after an examination of the various aspects.
231,1980-81,A committee for guiding the legal aid schemes and implementing the same is being constituted with a Supreme Court Judge as its Chairman.
232,1980-81,The Budget for 198081 makes a provision for this purpose.
233,1980-81,"Taking into account the effect of the above and some other changes, the total nonPlan expenditure is now estimated at Rs 13,051 crores as against Rs 12,822 crores in the interim Budget."
234,1980-81,"As regards receipts in the current year, at existing levels of taxation Corporation tax is estimated to yield Rs 11 crores more than what was reflected in the interim Budget; this improvement is mainly based on the actual trends of collection in 197980."
235,1980-81,"On the basis of latest available data on estimated levels of imports and production during the current year, Customs duties and Union Excise duties are also expected to yield Rs 40 crores and Rs 108 crores respectively more than anticipated in the interim Budget."
236,1980-81,"However, these increases will be more or less offset by the recent decision of Government to withdraw customs and excise duties on fertilizers."
237,1980-81,"Taking into account States’ share of taxes, net tax revenue at existing rates of taxation is estimated at Rs 8723 crores as against Rs 8725 crores in the interim Budget."
238,1980-81,"On the basis of the latest indications available, external assistance, net of repayments, in 198081 is estimated at Rs 1252 crores showing an increase of Rs 56 crores over the figures included in the interim Budget."
239,1980-81,In addition we expect to avail of a loan of Rs 540 crores from the Trust Fund of the International Monetary Fund in 198081 and the Budget assumes credit for this.
240,1980-81,There is a welcome increase in small savings collections.
241,1980-81,The estimate for 198081 is now placed at Rs 1100 crores as against Rs 1000 crores in the interim Budget.
242,1980-81,"Of the increase of Rs 100 crores, Rs 65 crores will accrue to the States as their share."
243,1980-81,"It has been decided that a part of the investible resources of Life Insurance Corporation, General Insurance Corporation, and Unit Trust of India should be lodged with Government in Special deposit accounts to augment resources for financing the Plan."
244,1980-81,Budget for 198081 takes a credit of Rs 100 crores on account of these deposits.
245,1980-81,"When we are seeking to step up investment in public sector, it is necessary to adopt an innovative approach to the problem of mobilising resources for sustaining such investment."
246,1980-81,"As Honourable Members know, private sector companies raise resources in the form of deposits from the public."
247,1980-81,Government feels that there is no reason why public sector companies with competent professional management should not do so.
248,1980-81,"Accordingly, we have decided to allow selected public sector units to raise public deposits on the same lines as the companies in the private sector."
249,1980-81,"When this scheme makes headway, dependence of these public sector enterprises on budgetary support will get reduced."
250,1980-81,But I have refrained from taking credit for such relief at this stage.
251,1980-81,"Taking into account other variations and also the effect of the changes in the fare and freight rates of Railways and of changes in Posts and Telegraphs tariff, to which I will refer a little later, the total receipts in 1980 81 are estimated at Rs 19,827 crores as against Rs 18,980 crores in the interim Budget."
252,1980-81,"Total expenditure is estimated at Rs 21,467 crores."
253,1980-81,The deficit at existing rates of taxes will thus be Rs 1640 crores.
254,1980-81,I now turn to my proposals in the field of direct taxes.
255,1980-81,"In framing these proposals, I have borne in mind certain broad considerations, namely, that the rate of direct taxes should be such as to promote voluntary compliance; that the farmers, workers and the middle class should be afforded some relief in pursuance of the commitment in our Party’s manifesto and some stimulus should be provided for raising the level of savings and investment in the national economy."
256,1980-81,"At the same time, a concerted attempt should be made to counter certain widely prevalent devices for tax avoidance through fragmentation of income and wealth."
257,1980-81,The middle class is among the worst hit by the rise in prices in recent years.
258,1980-81,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, even skilled workers in the organised sector 13 are now liable to incometax, at the present level of exemption."
259,1980-81,"With a view to keeping the sacrifice of revenue within manageable limits, the nil rate slab of income is being retained at Rs 8,000."
260,1980-81,"As a result, in cases where the taxable income exceeds Rs 12,000, the incidence of incometax, excluding surcharge, will remain at the existing levels, subject to the grant of marginal relief in cases where the taxable income exceeds the exemption limit by a small margin."
261,1980-81,This proposal will benefit more than six lakhs of incometax payers.
262,1980-81,Honourable Members will recall that the rates of incometax on the personal incomes were reduced in 1974 on the basis of a recommendation of the Direct Taxes Enquiry Committee and this process was taken one step further in 1976 when these rates were again lowered.
263,1980-81,The reduction in rates had largely fulfiled the expectation that it would lead to better tax compliance.
264,1980-81,"Unfortunately, the movement in this direction was reversed under the Janata Government and the rates of incometax were increased in stages."
265,1980-81,I am of the view that the position in this regard should be set right.
266,1980-81,I accordingly propose to reduce the surcharge on personal incomes in the case of all categories of noncorporate taxpayers from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.
267,1980-81,This will not only bring down the maximum marginal rate of tax from 72 per cent to 66 per cent but w111 benefit taxpayers in all slabs of income.
268,1980-81,"In view of the somewhat steep rise in prices of assets, I also propose to raise the exemption limit for wealthtax from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakhs with effect from the current assessment year."
269,1980-81,"In cases where the taxable wealth exceeds this limit, the tax burden will, however, be retained at existing levels, subject to the usual marginal relief."
270,1980-81,Government hopes that these concessions will provide the necessary inducement to the vast majority of our taxpayers for correct declaration of their incomes and wealth.
271,1980-81,I propose to counter some of the more commonly used devices for tax avoidance.
272,1980-81,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, the separate treatment accorded to Hindu undivided family in tax laws has been widely used for avoidance of proper tax liability."
273,1980-81,I accordingly propose to derecognise partial partitions of Hindu undivided families both for income and wealth taxation.
274,1980-81,"Partial partitions made on or after lst January, 1979 will not be recognised for tax purposes and taxes will continue to be levied on the basis that the existing Hindu undivided family had continued to remain joint."
275,1980-81,"At present, Hindu undivided families having one or more members with independent income exceeding the exemption limit are charged to incometax at rates which are somewhat higher than those applicable in the case of individuals."
276,1980-81,"In order 14 to further restrict the use of Hindu undivided family for the purposes of tax avoidance, I propose to raise the rates of incometax in the case of such Hindu undivided families."
277,1980-81,"The maximum marginal rate of 66 per cent will now apply on the slab of income over Rs 50,000 and the rates on some of the lower slabs will also be raised to somewhat higher levels."
278,1980-81,"With these two changes in regard to tax treatment of Hindu undivided families, I hope that the urge for forming multiple Hindu undivided families merely for fragmentation of income and reduction of tax liability will be weakened."
279,1980-81,Honourable Members will recall that the Government had in 1970 taken several measures to prevent the use of private discretionary trusts as a device for tax avoidance.
280,1980-81,"Experience, however, shows that these measures have not been fully effective and the proliferation of such trusts has not been curbed to the desired extent."
281,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to tighten the provisions in respect of private trusts."
282,1980-81,"At present, discretionary trusts are taxed at a flat rate of 65 per cent of their income and 1.5 per cent of their wealth, or at the rates applicable in the case of individual, whichever is higher."
283,1980-81,"Under my proposal, such trusts will be charged to incometax at the maximum marginal rate and to wealthtax at the flat rate of 3 per cent or at the appropriate rate applicable in the case of an individual, whichever is higher."
284,1980-81,I also propose to make several other provisions in relation to taxation of ‘private trusts with a view to plugging some loopholes which have come to the notice of Government.
285,1980-81,All these provisions will take effect from the current assessment year.
286,1980-81,Charitable and religious trusts are sometimes used for acquiring or maintaining control over business or industry for private ends.
287,1980-81,"In 1975, we had laid down a pattern for investment of funds of charitable or religious trusts if they were to continue to enjoy the tax exemption."
288,1980-81,"With a view to enabling such trusts to change over to the new pattern of investment in a smooth and gradual manner, the law provided that the new pattern may be adopted before 1st April, 1978."
289,1980-81,"This date was subsequently extended to 1st April, 1981."
290,1980-81,"Such trusts have, therefore, been given ample time to adjust to the new policy."
291,1980-81,I want to put them m
292,1980-81,"Our tax laws have always sought to encourage longterm savings through life insurance, provident funds and other similar instruments."
293,1980-81,"Unfortunately, the efficacy of the provisions for encouraging savings was impaired last year when the incentives for savings were drastically reduced."
294,1980-81,Honourable Members should be glad to know that I propose to restore incentives for such savings to the pre1979 budget levels.
295,1980-81,"The taxpayers will thus be entitled to 100 per cent deduction in respect of the first five thousand rupees of the qualifying savings, 50 per cent in respect of the next five thousand rupees and 40 per cent of the balance."
296,1980-81,"As a further measure for promoting savings in the household sector, I propose to give an option to incometax payers to retain moneys in their Compulsory Deposit Accounts beyond the due dates on payment of interest at the existing rate 15 applicable to such deposits."
297,1980-81,"Further, I propose to liberalise the tax exemption in respect of interest on balances with recognised provident funds."
298,1980-81,"At present, interest on such funds is exempt from incometax to the extent it does not exceed onethird of the salary income of the employee."
299,1980-81,I propose to remove this ceiling limit.
300,1980-81,It is essential to promote new investment in industry.
301,1980-81,"At the same time, the fiscal system should not lead to a bias in favour of capitalintensive techniques."
302,1980-81,"Keeping these twin objectives in view, I propose to continue the tax holiday in respect of new industrial undertakings, ships and hotels, but in a modified form."
303,1980-81,"Under my proposal, tax holiday will be available in respect of new industrial undertakings, ships or approved hotels with reference to a specified percentage of the income derived from these sources."
304,1980-81,"In the case of companies, 25 per cent of the profits derived from these sources will be exempt for a period of seven years."
305,1980-81,"In the case of noncorporate taxpayers, the percentage of exempted profits will be 20 per cent."
306,1980-81,"In the case of cooperative societies, the tax holiday will be available for a period of ten years as against seven years in the case of other categories of taxpayers."
307,1980-81,"This concession will be available in the case of all smallscale industrial undertakings which go into production after 31st March, 1981 but before 1st Apr11,1985, that is, till the end of the new FiveYear Plan period."
308,1980-81,"For other industrial undertakings, the concession will apply only where they do not produce articles or things listed in the Eleventh Schedule to the incometax Act."
309,1980-81,The concession will also be available in the case of approved hotels which start functioning or new ships which are acquired during that period.
310,1980-81,It is necessary to encourage new investment particularly in view of shortages in several key sectors of the economy.
311,1980-81,"As a special stimulus for new investment, I propose to allow, in the year of installation, an additional depreciation in an amount equal to 50 per cent of the normal depreciation on new machinery or plant installed during the new Plan period."
312,1980-81,"The proposed additional depreciation will not be admissible in respect of ships, aircraft, road transport vehicles, office appliances or machinery or plant installed in office premises or residential accommodation."
313,1980-81,There is a widespread feeling of frustration among the scientific community.
314,1980-81,This Government is keenly aware of the contribution which our scientists and technologists can make to the economic regeneration of India and is determined to promote research and development activities in a big way.
315,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to allow a weighted deduction in an amount equal to 125 per cent of the actual expenditure incurred on scientific research in any inhouse R & D facility where such expenditure is incurred on a programme approved by the prescribed authority having regard to the social, economic and industrial needs of India."
316,1980-81,I have no doubt that the Honourable Members will welcome these concessions.
317,1980-81,"At present, incometax payers are required to pay advance tax during the financial year on the basis of their own statements or estimates."
318,1980-81,"Where the estimated advance tax is likely to fall short of the tax on current income by more than 331/3 per cent of the estimate, the taxpayers are required to make an upward revision of the estimates."
319,1980-81,I propose to reduce this margin from 331/3 per cent to 20 per cent in the case of companies.
320,1980-81,There will be no change for other taxpayers.
321,1980-81,This change will enable us to realise a larger share of the tax due as advance tax and thus have a favourable impact on Government’s ways and means position in 198081.
322,1980-81,"In order to encourage the employment of blind and handicapped persons in business and industry, I propose to provide for a weighted deduction of one and onethird times the salary paid to such persons by employers where such salary does not exceed twenty thousand rupees in a year."
323,1980-81,I propose to enhance the deduction currently available in computing the taxable income of blind and handicapped persons from five thousands rupees to ten thousand rupees.
324,1980-81,"At present, standard deduction in computing the salary income is not available in the case of pensioners."
325,1980-81,"With a view to affording some relief to pensioners who are amongst the worst hit by the rise in prices, I propose to extend the benefit of standard deduction in their case as well."
326,1980-81,"In order to encourage our sportsmen to compete in international events, I propose to allow a deduction equal to 25 per cent of their foreign earnings if these are brought into India in foreign exchange."
327,1980-81,This provision will apply in relation to the current assessment year and onwards.
328,1980-81,"I also propose to allow higher deduction in respect of savings made by sportsmen through life insurance and provident funds, etc. as currently available in the case of authors, playwrights, artists, musicians and actors."
329,1980-81,"Sportsmen will thus be entitled to deduct contributions made to life insurance and provident funds up to 40 per cent of their professional income and 30 per cent of the remaining income, subject to a maximum of Rs 50,000."
330,1980-81,"In 1978, certain restrictions were placed on the deductible amount of expenditure on advertisement, publicity and sales promotion."
331,1980-81,These restrictions have particularly hurt small and medium business.
332,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to do away with these restrictions."
333,1980-81,"At present, income from poultry and dairy farming and livestock breeding is exempt from incometax upto 331/3 per cent of such income or ten thousand rupees, whichever is higher."
334,1980-81,I feel that time has come when persons deriving income from these sources should also contribute a little more to the national exchequer.
335,1980-81,"I accordingly propose to restrict the deduction in respect of such income to onethird of such income or fifteen thousand rupees, whichever is less."
336,1980-81,"At present, agricultural property is included in the taxable wealth for the purposes of the levy of wealthtax."
337,1980-81,"At the time when agricultural property was brought 17 within the tax net, it was hoped that it would be a potent instrument for mobilising resources from the affluent section of agriculturists."
338,1980-81,But our experience of over the last decade has been most disappointing.
339,1980-81,The amount realised as wealthtax on agricultural property has generally been less than Rs 1 crore per annum.
340,1980-81,The valuation of agricultural land has posed difficulties leading to complaints of harassment.
341,1980-81,"As this tax has clearly failed to achieve its original objective, I propose to discontinue the levy of Wealthtax on agricultural property except in the case of owners of tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom plantations."
342,1980-81,I am sure that this measure will be widely welcomed by our farmers.
343,1980-81,I also propose to make certain amendments in the incometax Act to counteract certain court decisions which have resulted in unintended benefit to taxpayers.
344,1980-81,The Finance Bill further contains certain proposals for the amendment of direct taxes which are of minor significance.
345,1980-81,I will not take the valuable time of the House in explaining the same.
346,1980-81,The reduction in rates and other concessions in respect of direct taxes should ordinarily involve loss of revenue.
347,1980-81,"However, I am of the view that reduction in rates will lead to significantly improved compliance with tax laws."
348,1980-81,The legislative amendments made for countering tax avoidance devices and the changes in the provisions in regard to advance tax should result in larger accretion of revenue.
349,1980-81,"On a broad judgement of the overall impact of all the proposals relating to incometax avid wealthtax, I am not assuming any loss of revenue."
350,1980-81,"I recognise, however, that there may be need for some adjustment in the interse shares of Centre and States under incometax."
351,1980-81,Such adjustments will be made in the course of the year in the light of trends in collections.
352,1980-81,"An upward adjustment of lending rates should moderate the inflationary, pressures in the economy."
353,1980-81,"I accordingly propose to revive interesttax in relation to interest earned by scheduled commercial banks after 30th June, 1980."
354,1980-81,"The scope of the levy is being extended to cover also interest received by the larger allIndia industrial finance institutions, namely, IDBI, ICICI, IFCI and IRCI."
355,1980-81,The tax will be levied at the rate of 7 per cent m the chargeable amount of interest as in the past.
356,1980-81,This measure will yield Rs 217 crores in a full year and about Rs 108.5 crores in the year 198081.
357,1980-81,"With a view to checking lavish expenditure incurred on accommodation and entertainment in luxury hotels, I propose to introduce a Bill in the current session to levy a new tax at 15 per cent on gross receipts of hotels in which the minimum tariff for a single room is 75 rupees per day."
358,1980-81,"The new levy is proposed to be made effective from lst September, 1980."
359,1980-81,This will yield about Rs 12 crores in a full year and the revenue during 198081 will be of the order of Rs 5 crores.
360,1980-81,I shall now turn to my proposals on indirect taxes.
361,1980-81,In framing my proposals I have kept in view the following objectives.
362,1980-81,"To the extent additional resource mobilization is inescapable, this should be done in such a way as not to enhance the 18 burden on any commodity significantly."
363,1980-81,"Subject to this consideration, the small scale segment of our industry should be encouraged."
364,1980-81,Industries with significant employment and export potential should be provided encouragement through suitable adjustment of duty structure.
365,1980-81,The duty burden on some articles of common consumption should be reduced or totally removed.
366,1980-81,At the outset I would like to put the Honourable Members at ease by pointing out that my proposals are modest.
367,1980-81,I have tried to avoid the usual device of picking out selected items for new or increased levies ht relatively high rates.
368,1980-81,"For this year, I have sought to spread the effect of the additional taxation thinly on a wide range of products, taking care to leave out articles of common consumption."
369,1980-81,"I propose to achieve this objective through the special excise duty which is even now leviable on all excisable goods at 1/20th of the basic excise duty, but from which a number of commodities have been exempted."
370,1980-81,"Under my proposal, the special excise duty will be levied on those items which are at present, exempt from the levy, at the rate of 1/20th of the effective basic excise duty rates applicable."
371,1980-81,"Certain commodities will, however, continue to be totally exempt from the levy."
372,1980-81,"Thus there will be no special duty on motor spirit including naphtha, kerosene, high speed diesel oil, light diesel oil and liquefied petroleum gas or on coal or electricity."
373,1980-81,"Again, the special excise duty will not be levied on matches, or on vanspati, or on goods falling under Tariff Item 68."
374,1980-81,"Where special excise is already leviable at 1/20th of the effective basic duty, I propose to increase this to 1/10th of the effective basic duty."
375,1980-81,"This increase will not, however, apply to furnace oil, asphalt, bitumen and tar, petroleum products not otherwise specified and calcined petroleum coke."
376,1980-81,Sugar and processed vegetable nonessential oils will also not be subjected to the increased levy.
377,1980-81,"Cigarettes, which are at present totally exempt from special excise duty will be subjected to special excise duty at 1/10th of the basic excise duty rates."
378,1980-81,These proposals would yield a revenue of Rs 197.71 crores in a full year.
379,1980-81,The impact of these proposals relating to special excise duties will also yield a sum of Rs 16.75 crores in the shape of countervailing duties on imported goods.
380,1980-81,Soda ash and caustic soda command a sizable premium in the market on account of persistent shortages.
381,1980-81,I propose to mop up a part of this premium by raising excise duty on these products from 10 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem.
382,1980-81,I also propose to increase the excise duty on starch from 10 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem.
383,1980-81,"This step will bring these chemical products on a par with other chemicals products which, in general, bear excise duty at 15 per cent ad valorem."
384,1980-81,Synthetic rubber at present bears duty at the very low level of 5 per cent ad valorem.
385,1980-81,"As a revenue measure, I propose to raise the excise duty on synthetic rubber from 5 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem."
386,1980-81,"Similarly, the rate of excise duty on specified acids is being raised from 10% to 15% ad valorem."
387,1980-81,"These measures would fetch in a full year, additional revenue of Rs 18.93 crores."
388,1980-81,"On revenue considerations, I propose to subject molasses to a specific 19 duty of Rs 30 per metric tonne under a separate Item in the Central Excise Tariff instead of 8 per cent under Item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff at present."
389,1980-81,"The levy is, however, proposed to be restricted to molasses produced in vacuum Dan sugar factories."
390,1980-81,"Molasses produced in khandsari sugar units, which goes interalia for edible purposes, is proposed to be exempted."
391,1980-81,The revenue yield as a result of this proposal is estimated to be Rs 4.24 crores in a year.
392,1980-81,I now come to proposals which are designed to provide a higher degree of protection to certain sectors of indigenous industry.
393,1980-81,"The first proposal relates to audio frequency amplifiers, an item reserved for the small scale sector."
394,1980-81,"In view of the adverse effect of imports of this item, I propose to increase the customs duty on imports from 75 per cent to 120 per cent ad valorem."
395,1980-81,My other proposal relates to imported unexposed colour positive cinematograph films in respect of which the basic customs duty is proposed to be raised from 50 paise to Rs 1/ per linear metre to enable the indigenous public sector unit to withstand competition from imports.
396,1980-81,I also propose to increase the countervailing duty on imported computers from 10 per cent to 20 per cent ad valorem as a measure of affording protection to the indigenous computer industry.
397,1980-81,These measures are designed to yield additional revenue of about Rs 1.83 crores in a full year.
398,1980-81,I have only one more revenue proposal in the field of indirect taxes.
399,1980-81,This relates to passengers’ baggage.
400,1980-81,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, baggage allowances were substantially liberalised in 1978 and, for the generality of Indian passengers going abroad for short visits, the allowances consist of Rs 1,000 worth of dutyfree goods and Rs 2,000 worth of goods on payment of duty."
401,1980-81,"Despite this liberalisation, goods in the nature of baggage continue to be imported by many passengers in quantities substantially higher than the permissible limits."
402,1980-81,This is mainly due to the prevailing craze for foreign goods and the high margin of profit on the sale of these goods in India.
403,1980-81,Such cases of import of baggage Items in excess of the permissible limits necessitate initiation of adjudication proceedings which generally have the effect of slowing down the tempo of passenger clearance in our international airports.
404,1980-81,I have given thought to this problem and I am making two proposals in this regard.
405,1980-81,The first is a pure revenue measure of increasing the effective rataof duty on baggage articles in excess of the free allowances from 120 per cent ad valorem to 150 per cent ad valorem.
406,1980-81,This measure is to come into force immediately and is expected to yield an additional Rs 2 crores in a full year.
407,1980-81,"The second measure to be brought into force shortly, provides for the levy of duty at a flat rate of 320 per cent on baggage imported in excess of the permissible limits, that is, in excess of what can be passed free or on a duty of 150 per cent."
408,1980-81,"At present, such articles would be treated as unlicensed imports, resulting in confiscations, fines and penalties designed to wipe out any profit on their sale."
409,1980-81,"The increased rate of duty is intended to replace these fines and penalties, without having to go through the timeconsuming process of adjudication."
410,1980-81,"Goods which are obviously in the nature of trade goods will, however, still attract penal action."
411,1980-81,I have a few other proposals which are essentially in the nature of rationalisation measures.
412,1980-81,The first one relates to aerated waters.
413,1980-81,In the interest of simplification.
414,1980-81,It is proposed to do away with the existing distinction between aerated waters containing caffeine and those not containing caffeine for the purpose of excise duty.
415,1980-81,"Instead, it is proposed to levy on all flavoured aerated waters a uniform duty at 40 per cent ad valorem."
416,1980-81,The revenue effect of the proposal is expected to be negligible.
417,1980-81,I have given considerable thought to the problems thrown up as a result of the changes made in the 1979 Budget in the excise duty structure applicable to the match industry.
418,1980-81,"While the duty advantage enjoyed by the cottage sector obviously needs to be maintained, the nonmechanised middle sector should not be allowed to make inroads into the cottage sector."
419,1980-81,"In order to ensure that the benefit of the lower rate of duty accrues only to the genuine cottage sector units, I propose to confine the duty concession to match boxes bearing approved labels and sold to or marketed through the KVIC, State Agencies and registered cooperative societies."
420,1980-81,"At the same time, I do not find justification for the continuance of the existing limits placed on the clearances of matches by the cottage sector at the concessional rate of duty."
421,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to abolish the existing limit on production by the cottage sector units."
422,1980-81,I am confident that this package of measures will result in accelerated growth of the cottage sector of the match industry.
423,1980-81,There have been complaints of malpractices in the biri industry by manufacturers who have been taking advantage of the liberal exemption limit applicable to the unbranded sector which is at present 60 lakhs of biris per manufacturer per year.
424,1980-81,"With a view to reducing the possibilities of malpractices, I propose to lower this exemption limit to 30 lakhs of unbranded biris per manufacturer per year, which will still leave out of the excise net the really small manufacturer and the self employed manufacturer."
425,1980-81,This is not designed as a revenue measure.
426,1980-81,Some of the provisions in the Finance Bill are aimed at rationalisation or clearer definition of certain central excise tariff items to remove doubts or difficulties which have come to notice.
427,1980-81,The details of these measures may be found in the Budget papers.
428,1980-81,I shall now turn to concessions in the area of indirect taxes.
429,1980-81,The small manufacturer plays a significant role in our economy.
430,1980-81,I would like to improve his competitive position visavis the large manufacturer and thus widen the entrepreneurial base of our economy.
431,1980-81,Only in this way can we check concentration of economic power.
432,1980-81,"There is already a scheme of excise duty concessions applicable to manufacturers of 70 excisable commodities, under which clearances upto Rs 5 lakhs in value in a year have been exempted from duty."
433,1980-81,I now propose to liberalise this concession in two respects.
434,1980-81,First I propose to include two more groups of commodities under the scheme.
435,1980-81,"These are chemicals, namely, sodium bichromate, bleaching powder, calcium carbide and artificial and synthetic resins and plastic material."
436,1980-81,"Besides, the coverage is being 21 widened in respect of paper and paper boards."
437,1980-81,"But the second and important concession which I propose to introduce is that in respect of all the commodities covered by the scheme, clearances between Rs 5 lakhs and Rs 15 lakhs will bear only threefourths of the applicable rate of excise duty as against the normal duty at present."
438,1980-81,This measure should benefit a large number of small manufacturers.
439,1980-81,The revenue sacrifice will be of the order of Rs 6.50 crores in a full year.
440,1980-81,Last year’s Budget made a change which affected a substantial number of small manufacturers of goods falling under the residuary Item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff.
441,1980-81,Honourable Members will recall that the quantum of dutyfree clearances was reduced from Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs.
442,1980-81,I had opposed this change then.
443,1980-81,"As a measure of undoing the hardship caused to such small manufacturers, I propose to provide for complete exemption from duty for clearances upto Rs 30 lakhs per annum."
444,1980-81,"In other words, small manufacturers of goods falling under Item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff, whose capital investment on plant and machinery does not exceed Rs 10 lakhs, will be eligible for complete exemption from duty on their first clearances of goods upto Rs 30 lakhs in a financial year provided their clearances during the preceding financial year did not exceed Rs 30 lakhs."
445,1980-81,"For the remaining part of the current financial year, the quantum of clearances eligible for full exemption from duty will be fixed at a correspondingly lower figure."
446,1980-81,This concession is expected to cost Rs 2.4 crores in a full year.
447,1980-81,Paper and allied products are in short supply in the country and new investment in this sector has not been readily forthcoming.
448,1980-81,Much can be done by smaller units to help in filling the production gap.
449,1980-81,"To encourage them, I propose to extend a concessional rate of duty of 20 per cent ad valorem as against the present rate of 30 per cent, to paper and paper board produced by small manufacturers whose clearances in the preceding financial year did not exceed 300 tonnes of paper and paper board."
450,1980-81,This concession will cost a little less than Rs 1 crore in a full year.
451,1980-81,The electronics industry has considerable employment and export potential.
452,1980-81,We have the necessary skills and expertise and these should be harnessed through appropriate fiscal incentives for development of the electronics industry in a big way.
453,1980-81,This is a field which offers great scope to small scale manufacturers.
454,1980-81,"I am, therefore, proposing some duty concessions in respect of the industry."
455,1980-81,There will be a reduction in customs duty on specified items of capital goods such as machines and instruments required by the electronics industry and not produced within the country.
456,1980-81,The customs duty on such items will be reduced from the present levels of duty which in some cases are as high as 89% ad valorem to a total of 25% ad valorem.
457,1980-81,"Similarly, I also propose to reduce the customs duty on specified raw materials and components required for the electronics industry from their present levels which in some cases are higher than 200% ad valorem to 45,9 ad valorem plus countervailing duty where an excise duty is leviable under Item 68."
458,1980-81,These two concessions will cost the exchequer Rs 4.7 crores in a full year.
459,1980-81,The experience of other countries shows that the growth of consumer electronics facilitates in due course the development of other sophisticated lines of production in electronics.
460,1980-81,Television is a powerful medium of communication and education.
461,1980-81,"With a view to enabling a. large number of people to get the benefit of this medium, I propose to reduce the excise duty on cheaper priced T.V. sets from 15% ad valorem to 10% ad valorem, and to effect a corresponding reduction in the duty on other T.V. sets from 30% to 25% ad valorem."
462,1980-81,These concessions would entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 1.5 crores in a year.
463,1980-81,Radio is an equally powerful instrument of education and entertainment and is more widely in use.
464,1980-81,Government considers that single and two band radio sets should be popularised in rural areas.
465,1980-81,The licence fee m such sets has proved to be irksome and inhibits purchase of radio sets by the rural folk.
466,1980-81,"It is, therefore, proposed to abolish the fee in respect of single and two band radio sets including transistor sets."
467,1980-81,"This measure, which I am sure will be widely welcomed, will cost Government about Rs 4 crores."
468,1980-81,"Our computer industry is still in its infancy, compared with those of other countries."
469,1980-81,"In order to provide an additional incentive for indigenous production and improvement, I propose to reduce the excise duty m indigenously manufactured computers from 25% to 20% ad valorem."
470,1980-81,Ship building is a high priority industry and has an important part to play in promoting economic self reliance.
471,1980-81,The Indian ship building industry is finding It increasingly difficult to face competition from foreign shipyards.
472,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to extend full exemption from excise duty to ocean going vessels built in Indian shipyards."
473,1980-81,This relief would cost about Rs 5 crores in the current financial year.
474,1980-81,Honourable Members would be aware that Government has been following the practice of bringing down the import duty on selected machinery items having no indigenous angle to 25 per cent ad valorem as a measure of reducing capital costs in industries.
475,1980-81,"Carrying this process further, I propose, this year, to reduce the import duty to 25 per cent ad valorem on twelve more items of capital equipment."
476,1980-81,"These include five Items of machinery used in the printing industry, such as High speed Letter press rotary and offset rotary printing machines, Mono/Lino Type Casting machines, etc."
477,1980-81,These concessions would entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 1.84 crores in a full year.
478,1980-81,The cost of high pressure gas cylinders constitutes a significant portion of the total capital outlay required by the Gas industry.
479,1980-81,"With a view to reducing, at least in part, this capital outlay, I propose to extend complete exemption from customs duty on steel tubes imported for fabrication of high pressure gas cylinders."
480,1980-81,"I also propose to reduce the excise duty m such cylinders from the existing level of 15 per cent, to 8 per cent ad valorem."
481,1980-81,"These two measures, taken together, are estimated to cost Rs 1.89 crores in a full year."
482,1980-81,"I have a proposal of general application, which is intended to facilitate manufacturers of excisable goods, using inputs on which excise duty is leviable."
483,1980-81,"In order to give relief in such cases, two procedures are in vogue at present."
484,1980-81,One is what is called the setoff procedure The other is the proforma credit procedure under rule 56A of the Central Excise Rules.
485,1980-81,The proforma credit procedure is generally recognised to be more beneficial and less Irksome to the manufacturers.
486,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to replace the existing concessions based on the setoff procedure by similar concessions based on the proforma credit procedure."
487,1980-81,I am sure that this measure will be welcomed by the industry.
488,1980-81,It is a little painful for me to remind Honourable Members that last year’s budget had increased excise duty m a number of articles of common consumption to a significant extent.
489,1980-81,I propose to reverse this trend.
490,1980-81,"Thus   Specified lifesaving drugs, 30 in number, will be fully exempted from excise duty."
491,1980-81,The list will be kept under periodical review with a view to adding more items as may be warranted;  Controlled cloth is meant for the weaker sections of society and its cost should be as low as possible.
492,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to exempt controlled cloth from excise duty.  "
493,1980-81,Cotton and Cottonviscose blend hosiery consisting of Items like banians are of relatively low value and these are now subject to excise duty at 8 per cent.
494,1980-81,I propose to exempt them fully from excise duty.  
495,1980-81,Cycles are the poor man’s conveyance.
496,1980-81,"I, therefore, propose to totally exempt cycles and cycle parts falling under Item 68 from excise duty.  "
497,1980-81,"Sewing machines, which are indispensable to the housewife and also enable the weaker sections to earn a living, will also be fully exempted from excise duty.  "
498,1980-81,Pressure cookers which take the drudgery out of the house wife’s daily tasks and save fuel now attract duty at 15 per cent.
499,1980-81,I propose to reduce it to 10 per cent.
500,1980-81,I also propose to make substantial reductions in excise duty m some other Items of everyday use.
501,1980-81,Accordingly  Excise duty on cheaper varieties of toilet soap will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;  Excise duty on tooth paste will be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent;  Vacuum and gasfilled bulbs not exceeding 60 watts will have the duty reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.
502,1980-81,"I am sure these substantial concessions, which would cost the exchequer approximately Rs 15 crores in a full year, will be welcomed by Parliament and by the public."
503,1980-81,I also hope that industry and trade will play fair by the consumer and pass on the benefit of these duty reductions to the consumer.
504,1980-81,Our Party’s election manifesto has referred to the need to encourage dieselisation of taxis.
505,1980-81,"In fulfilment of this commitment and with a view to giving an incentive for taxiowners to go in for dieselisation, I propose to extend full excise duty exemption to diesel engines used for conversion of petrol driven taxis."
506,1980-81,My second proposal is aimed at giving relief to the cycle rickshaw driver.
507,1980-81,Powered cycle rickshaws are already exempt from excise duty.
508,1980-81,To encourage motorisation of nonpowered cycle rickshaws.
509,1980-81,I propose to extend full duty exemption for internal combustion engines used for this purpose.
510,1980-81,"I am sure Honourable Members will welcome this measure, as a visible sign of our keenness to reduce physical strain and at the same time encourage this relatively cheap means of transport."
511,1980-81,"Before I leave the field of indirect taxes, I have a major declaim of policy to announce."
512,1980-81,"For the past couple of decades, there has been a persistent public demand for the setting up of an independent Appellate Tribunal for customs and central excise matters, somewhat similar to the setup on the Direct Taxes side."
513,1980-81,This demand has recently been endorsed by the Estimates Committee of Parliament.
514,1980-81,"Government has, in the past, not been in favour of such a system, as it was felt that it would not be appropriate in the case of indirect taxes, and that the present departmental machinery was in fact adopting an objective approach."
515,1980-81,"I think a time has come when we should gracefully accept the common view, which is based m the dictum that justice should not only be done but should also seem to be done."
516,1980-81,"It is in this spirit that provision has been made in the Finance Bill for setting up an Appellate Tribunal to hear appeals in respect of customs, central excise and gold control matters."
517,1980-81,This Tribunal will be independent of the executive machinery charged with the responsibility of daytoday administration of revenue laws.
518,1980-81,I have no doubt that this measure will meet with the wholehearted approval of Parliament and of trade and industry.
519,1980-81,My taxation proposals will yield a sum of Rs 223.
520,1980-81,The reliefs I have announced add up to Rs 34.75 crores m the central excise side and Ra.7.93 crores m the customs side.
521,1980-81,"The net yield is, therefore, Rs 188.47 crores from Central excise duties and Rs 31.65 crores from customs duties."
522,1980-81,The accrual to the Central exchequer in a full year will be Rs 144.85 crores and the share of the States will be Rs 75.27 crores.
523,1980-81,"Where changes are proposed to be made by notifications, effective from the 19th June,1980, copies of such notifications will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
524,1980-81,"I wish to say now a few words on behalf of my honourable colleague, the Minister of Communications."
525,1980-81,Payment of dearness allowance and sanction of bonus linked to productivity to the staff of the Posts and Telegraphs Department have increased the working expenses of the Department.
526,1980-81,"It has, therefore, become necessary,to increase the tariffs on a few selected services."
527,1980-81,"In making tariff revision proposals, Government has carefully avoided revision of charges for such services as are generally used by the common man."
528,1980-81,There will be no increase in the price of post cards and inland letters.
529,1980-81,"The tariff for letters is, however, being increased from 30 paise to 35 paise at the lowest slab."
530,1980-81,The rate for parcels will be stepped up from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.00 for every 500 grams.
531,1980-81,The charges for installation and shifting of telephone connections are also being increased.
532,1980-81,"Local calls beyond 5,000 cans in a quarter will be charged at 50 paise per call as against 40 paise at present."
533,1980-81,A memorandum showing the proposed tariffs is being circulated along with Budget papers.
534,1980-81,It will be seen that the charges for the bulk of postal and telecommunications services have been left untouched.
535,1980-81,The changes would take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed by Parliament.
536,1980-81,The proposed tariff revisions are estimated to bring in an additional revenue of Rs 27.10 crores per annum.
537,1980-81,The additional revenue during the year 198081 would be of the order of Rs 13 crores and has been taken into account in estimating the revenues of the Posts and Telegraphs.
538,1980-81,"The tax effort net of reliefs proposed in the Budget will m the whole bring in about Rs 282 crores for the current year, of which Rs 223 crores will accrue to the Centre."
539,1980-81,There will be a residual deficit of Rs 1417 crores which I propose to leave uncovered.
540,1980-81,This deficit is only a little over half the deficit of last year.
541,1980-81,It is my judgement that a deficit of this order will not have a significantly adverse impact m the economy.
542,1980-81,"If the monsoon turns out to be normal and if we continue the sound, economic policies already initiated, there is every hope that there will be an appreciable improvement in agriculture and industrial production resulting in a significant growth of GNP."
543,1980-81,We shall also pursue a responsible monetary policy so that expansion of bank credit for unproductive or speculative purposes is held in check.
544,1980-81,"Sir, within the constraints imposed by the difficult economic situation inherited by the present Government, I have endeavoured my best to provide relief to those who deserve it most."
545,1980-81,"But since reliefs can only be palliatives and the real need of a poor society is growth, I have tried to impart a judicious stimulus to investment."
546,1980-81,"With the higher levels of investment, in the public sector as well as the private sector, and its particular sectoral distribution, both production and employment should register a substantial increase."
547,1980-81,This Government has a special responsibility towards the weaker sections of society who have so enthusiastically supported it.
548,1980-81,The Budget seeks to protect them through special programmes designed to promote their wen being.
549,1980-81,"It is also our firm resolve that no matter how difficult the economic situation is, the minimum basic needs of consumption of the poorer sections and the middle classes will be met 26 through a reinvigorated public distribution system."
550,1980-81,With a strong and cohesive Government it should be possible to utilise fully the existing production potential.
551,1980-81,"My Budget represents a modest contribution to the process of restoring the country’s economy to the path of stability, growth and social justice."
552,1980-81,"Its success, however, depends upon the cooperation of all people who work in the fields or factories, power stations or ports, railways or coal mines."
553,1980-81,The people of this country have high hopes about the ability of the present Government to achieve these goals and I am sure will be prepared to give their whole hearted support in this task.
554,1980-81,"It should be the common endeavour of all of us, rising above partisan prejudices and passions to harness the people’s enthusiasm for the tasks of development."
555,1981-82,"The Budget for 198182 has been formulated in an economic situation which continues to be difficult, but also shows great improvement over the desperate conditions prevailing a year ago."
556,1981-82,The “Economic Survey” presented to the House this week contains a detailed review of developments in the past year.
557,1981-82,"I shall, therefore, only review the highlights of the economic situation as a background to presenting the strategy of next year’s budget."
558,1981-82,"It was reeling from a disastrous economic performance in 197980, when the Gross National Product declined by 4.5 per cent and prices increased by over 21 per cent."
559,1981-82,"Neglect and mismanagement of the infrastructure had produced a crisis situation in key sectors such as coal, power and railways."
560,1981-82,This was no easy task.
561,1981-82,"The severe drought of 197980, and the accumulated problems in management of the infrastructure, cast a long shadow over 198081."
562,1981-82,Efforts to improve infrastructure performance deserved and received the highest priority in 198081.
563,1981-82,"A mechanism for crisis management was established, with special administrative arrangements to monitor and coordinate Government action in this area, and to set clear priorities."
564,1981-82,"It took time for these efforts to bear fruit, but by the middle of the fiscal year, all the three sectors, power, coal and railways showed distinct improvement."
565,1981-82,"This was a direct consequence of the acute drought of 1979, which left the reservoirs severely depleted through the lean summer months of 1980."
566,1981-82,Hydroelectric generation picked up after July when most of the reservoirs were replenished by the monsoon.
567,1981-82,There was also a very substantial improvement in thermal generation.
568,1981-82,"The problems of coal availability which had plagued thermal power plants during 1979, were substantially overcome and rail movement of coal to thermal plants was organised on a priority basis."
569,1981-82,Strenuous efforts were also made to improve 1
570,1981-82,"It is my privilege, once again, to present the Budget to this august House."
571,1981-82,"As a result, thermal electricity generation in November and December 1980 was 21 per cent higher than in the same months in 1979."
572,1981-82,"For the year as a whole, electricity generation is likely to show an increase of about 6 per cent over 197980."
573,1981-82,"However, in the second half of 198081 generation would be about 13 per cent higher than the second half of the previous year."
574,1981-82,The production of coal and lignite had remained more or less stagnant at about 106 million tonnes since 197677.
575,1981-82,This frustrating spell of stagnation has been broken and production is expected to exceed 115 million tonnes in 198081.
576,1981-82,Better availability of power was one of the important factors behind this improved performance.
577,1981-82,"The railways have shown improvement in the movement of freight in recent months, breaking a pattern of deterioration witnessed over the past three years."
578,1981-82,Industrial production in 198081 reflected.
579,1981-82,The progress made in removing infrastructure constraints.
580,1981-82,I have already mentioned that hydroelectric generation was very low in the first three months of 198081 because of the depletion of reservoirs.
581,1981-82,The resulting shortage of power depressed industrial production through much of the first half of 198081.
582,1981-82,"However, with the easing of infrastructure constraints in the second half of the year, industrial production has picked up."
583,1981-82,"For the year as a whole, it is likely to show a growth of about 4 per cent."
584,1981-82,This compares with a decline of 1.4 per cent in 197980.
585,1981-82,"In addition to efforts at improving infrastructure performance, the Government also took wide ranging measures designed to create conditions conducive to rapid industrial expansion."
586,1981-82,Hon’ble Members will recall that the Budget for 1980 81 contained specific fiscal incentives designed to encourage investment activity.
587,1981-82,This was followed by the industrial Policy Statement of July 1980 in which several promotional measures were announced.
588,1981-82,Steps were also taken in the course of the year to increase the flow of investment finance to industry.
589,1981-82,A new policy has been enunciated to permit investment funds from oil exporting developing countries to flow into new units in selected industries in the form of portfolio investment.
590,1981-82,The guidelines for issue of debentures were revised to permit more effective use of this instrument for mobilisation of funds.
591,1981-82,"Although the promotional impact of these measures could not manifest itself fully in 198081 because of infrastructure bottlenecks, they have undoubtedly set the stage for longer term industrial expansion in the coming years."
592,1981-82,The performance of agriculture in 198081 gives every ground for satisfaction and provides great reassurance about the basic health of this vital sector of our economy.
593,1981-82,"The weather in 198081 was favourable in most, but by no means all parts of the country, and this created conditions conducive to an agricultural recovery."
594,1981-82,"The total production of food grains in 198081 is likely to exceed 132 minion tonnes, which is more than 23 minion tonnes higher than in 197980."
595,1981-82,"It will surpass the previous peak level achieved in 191879, and yet weather conditions were less favourable than in that year."
596,1981-82,The gains in food grains production in 198081 have been accompanied by a very substantial recovery in sugarcane production.
597,1981-82,Production of fibre crops was also good.
598,1981-82,This excellent performance testifies to the soundness of the agricultural strategy we introduced in the late sixties.
599,1981-82,This strategy was vigorously pursued in 198081.
600,1981-82,A concerted effort was made to ensure adequate production of quality seeds.
601,1981-82,The area under high yielding varieties was expanded to 48 million hectares compared with only 35.2 million hectares in 197980.
602,1981-82,Large imports of fertilisers were undertaken to supplement domestic production.
603,1981-82,Fertiliser consumption in terms of nutrients is estimated to have increased from 5.26 minion tonnes to 5.6 million tonnes.
604,1981-82,Expansion of Irrigation received special attention and the agricultural extension machinery was strengthened to ensure a more effective transfer of technology.
605,1981-82,"The excellent performance of agriculture, combined with the beginning of a recovery in industry is likely to produce an overall growth of 6.5 per cent in the Gross National Product."
606,1981-82,"This is an important achievement, but I must caution against complacency."
607,1981-82,"The progress made needs to be consolidated, and further momentum must be built up if the recovery of 198081 is to mature into fullfledged growth next year."
608,1981-82,"This calls for a realistic assessment of the strengths, as well as the weaknesses, of the economy."
609,1981-82,The economy continued to be subject to inflationary pressure during 1980 81 although there can be no doubt that there was a marked improvement over 1979 80.
610,1981-82,The increase in prices during 198081 upto the end of January 1981 has been 13.5 per cent.
611,1981-82,It was nearly 20 per cent in the same period of the previous year.
612,1981-82,"Inflationary pressures were particularly severe in the first half of the year because of the after effects of the drought of 1979 and this was especially evident in the behaviour of sugar, gur and khandsari prices."
613,1981-82,"With the improvement in the supply situation in the second half of the year, there was a definite improvement."
614,1981-82,Prices declined from the middle of October to the end of December.
615,1981-82,"They have risen since then, partly because of the unavoidable increase in petroleum prices effected in January."
616,1981-82,"However in recent weeks, the increase in prices has moderated."
617,1981-82,"I must caution however that although inflation has abated, it has not been overcome."
618,1981-82,"The economy remains subject to continuing cost push pressures, including especially the transmission of international inflation through rising prices of oil and other essential imports."
619,1981-82,"Since these cost push pressures are likely to persist, continued vigilance is required in the coming year."
620,1981-82,It is essential to evolve a strategy for coping with costpush inflation effectively by tackling  the problem at its roots.
621,1981-82,This is not only a matter of demand management.
622,1981-82,It also requires an all out effort to increase efficiency and achieve higher productivity.
623,1981-82,Monetary and credit policies in 198081 were tailored to the requirements of the inflationary situation and commercial credit was strictly regulated.
624,1981-82,"In addition, steps were taken to ensure that the distribution of bank credit conforms to our economic and social priorities."
625,1981-82,"The Reserve Bank has evolved guidelines to ensure that an increasing share of priority sector credit is directed to weaker sections, especially those Identified in the 20 point programme."
626,1981-82,"According to these guidelines, 40 per cent of priority sector lending is to be earmarked for the agricultural sector."
627,1981-82,Half of the direct lending by commercial banks to agriculture and allied activities will be directed to small and marginal farmers and agricultural labourers.
628,1981-82,"Furthermore, 12.5 per cent of total credit advanced to smallscale industries will be reserved for rural artisans, village craftsmen and cottage industries."
629,1981-82,The expansion of banking in the rural areas is continuing and the programme of establishing Regional Rurki Banks has been accelerated.
630,1981-82,There were only 60 such banks at the end of December 1979.
631,1981-82,There will be one hundred by the end of March 1981.
632,1981-82,Another 25 Regional Rural Banks will be established in the year 198182.
633,1981-82,"It is proposed to increase their number to 170, covering 270 districts, by the end of the Sixth Plan."
634,1981-82,A National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development will be established as an apex institution to meet the credit needs of the rural community and a bill to this effect will be introduced shortly.
635,1981-82,This is an appropriate occasion to inform the House that we have decided to undertake a major reorganisation of the Life insurance Corporation in order to strengthen its ability to meet the challenges of the future.
636,1981-82,The Corporation has an impressive record of extending insurance services to the community.
637,1981-82,In the process it has grown very considerably in size.
638,1981-82,"It has, therefore, become desirable to restructure the Corporation into more manageable units in the interest of operational efficiency, and also to allow an element of healthy competition."
639,1981-82,"Accordingly, we have decided to reorganise the Corporation into five independent units with a coordinating body to provide supervision and guidance on matters of common interest."
640,1981-82,I have no doubt that these changes will improve the quality of service rendered to policy holders.
641,1981-82,"This re organisation will impart a greater degree of dynamism into the working of these institutions, and this will help to extend life insurance into the rural areas, where only limited headway has been made so far."
642,1981-82,The balance of payments situation facing the country gives cause for concern.
643,1981-82,Rising prices of imported oil have added enormously to the external payments burden on the economy.
644,1981-82,"The import bill for crude oil and petroleum products is likely to reach Rs 5,600 crores in 198081, compared with only Rs 1,677 crores two years ago."
645,1981-82,Most of the increase is due to the increase in on prices.
646,1981-82,"The total import bill in 1980 81 is likely to be around Rs 11,300 crores whereas exports are projected to be only Rs 7.100 crores."
647,1981-82,"Even after allowing for the surplus on net invisibles, the country has to finance a balance of payments deficit of about Rs 2,000 crores in 198081."
648,1981-82,This is much larger than the amount of external assistance available and it has led to a 4 significant draw  down of foreign exchange reserves.
649,1981-82,"It is, therefore, essential to evolve a strategy for bringing the balance of payments under control."
650,1981-82,The Government has already taken a number of steps in this direction.
651,1981-82,High priority has been accorded to oil and natural gas exploration in order to reduce our dependence on imported supplies as much as possible.
652,1981-82,The Oil and Natural Gas Commission has found evidence of hydrocarbons in several structures both offshore and onshore and it is essential to pursue the exploration and development effort with all the resources at our command.
653,1981-82,"To this end, an ambitious programme is envisaged for the Oil and Natural Gas Commission and 011 India Ltd."
654,1981-82,"The urgency of the situation is also such that the Government has decided to supplement our domestic capability by engaging foreign parties on contract, on a production sharing basis, to hasten the pace of exploration and development of potential oil fields."
655,1981-82,It is expected that the foreign companies selected under this scheme will commence work in the second half of 198182.
656,1981-82,The balance of payments situation also cans for strong support to exports and the Government has taken several important initiatives in this regard recently.
657,1981-82,Hon’ble Members will recall that in my Budget Speech last year I stated that the Government had taken a decision to establish an Exportimport Bank to assist in the financing of international trade.
658,1981-82,"The details of this proposal have now been worked out, and it is proposed to introduce a Bill in the current session for setting up the Export import Bank as a Statutory Corporation."
659,1981-82,I am providing Rs 70 crores in the Budget for this purpose.
660,1981-82,"There is also considerable scope for import substitution by increasing domestic production and expanding capacity in sectors such as steel, cement, fertiliser, nonferrous metals and oilseeds."
661,1981-82,This is being vigorously pursued.
662,1981-82,The strategy of the Budget I am about to present flows from my assessment of the state of the economy.
663,1981-82,We have come out of the crisis situation which prevailed a year ago.
664,1981-82,The agricultural sector has recovered and is well poised for continued growth.
665,1981-82,"The industrial recovery is as yet partial, but the various policy initiatives already taken have created conditions favourable for an industrial revival."
666,1981-82,"With further improvement in infrastructure performance, the constraints on industry in the coming year should be substantially eased."
667,1981-82,The emphasis in 198182 must therefore shift from crisis management to growth.
668,1981-82,"The tasks ahead of us have been clearly indicated in the Sixth Plan, which has now been approved by the National Development Council."
669,1981-82,"The Plan establishes a target of 5.2 per cent growth per annum and cans for an ambitious public sector investment programme of Rs 97,500 crores."
670,1981-82,"As in the past, agricultural development, with special emphasis on the weaker sections, is the centrepiece of our development strategy."
671,1981-82,But the Sixth Plan also identifies some other areas which have become especially critical.
672,1981-82,"The energytransport system comprising such critical sectors as 5 power, coal, oil, ports and railways, requires massive investments if these sectors are not to become a constraint upon economic growth."
673,1981-82,The Budget must make a beginning in undertaking these large and urgent tasks.
674,1981-82,But it must do so in the full knowledge that the threat of inflation has not been fully overcome.
675,1981-82,The fiscal deficit should therefore be kept within tolerable limits.
676,1981-82,"At the same time, taxation must be used judiciously so that it does not fan the flames of inflation as happened in 197980."
677,1981-82,Along with fiscal discipline we must also take steps to encourage the flow of private savings into the financial system.
678,1981-82,Only thus can we ensure adequate availability of noninflationary financing to meet the rapidly expanding needs of the economy.
679,1981-82,This flow of resources into the financial system is threatened in two ways and we must tackle both.
680,1981-82,"First of all, it is threatened by the pernicious growth of the black economy."
681,1981-82,"This generates income flows which cannot easily surface in the financial system, and are therefore directed into socially harmful activity such as hoarding, profiteering, speculation and wasteful consumption."
682,1981-82,This only stokes the fires of inflation.
683,1981-82,The Government has recently taken a major initiative to direct some of the resources circulating in the black economy into the public exchequer through the sale of Special Bearer Bonds.
684,1981-82,Further action on a wide front is necessary to check the generation of black money so that this social evil is progressively eliminated from our society.
685,1981-82,A second impediment to financial savings is the existence of high rates of inflation.
686,1981-82,In an inflationary situation it becomes essential to provide adequate incentives to financial savings.
687,1981-82,"Since bank deposits are the most important single mechanism for financial savings, it has been decided to raise the interest rate on maturities from one and upto five years."
688,1981-82,An announcement to this effect is being made by the Reserve Bank.
689,1981-82,The interest rate paid on deposits above 1 year maturity and upto 2 years will be raised from 7 per cent at present to 7.5 per cent.
690,1981-82,The rate paid on deposits above two years and upto three years will be raised from 7 per cent at present to 8.5 per cent.
691,1981-82,The rate paid on deposits above three years maturity will be raised from 8.5 per cent at present to 10 per cent.
692,1981-82,"The interest rate paid by banks on deposits above 5 years is unchanged, but a new National Savings Certificate will be issued with a maturity of 6 years which will carry an interest rate of 12 per cent."
693,1981-82,This will provide the necessary incentive for encouraging longer term savings.
694,1981-82,In addition to these measures.
695,1981-82,I propose to raise the interest rate ceiling on debentures from 12 per cent at present to 13.5 per cent.
696,1981-82,"This is in line with the other interest rate changes proposed, and it will encourage large industrial units to raise their requirements of investment finance through their own efforts."
697,1981-82,"It is essential that these units, which have the capacity to mobilise resources through the financial 6 markets, should make greater efforts in this direction and thus reduce the burden on the term lending institutions."
698,1981-82,"At present, public companies are permitted to accept deposits from the public upto 25 per cent of the aggregate of their paid up share capital and free reserves."
699,1981-82,They are also allowed to accept deposits upto 10 per cent of paid up capital and free reserves either from their shareholders or from others when guaranteed by a Director of the company.
700,1981-82,These limits do not apply to inter company deposits.
701,1981-82,These provisions governing company deposits will be continued.
702,1981-82,"However, it is proposed to impose a ceiling of 15 per cent on the interest rate which can be paid on these deposits."
703,1981-82,The requisite orders giving effect to these decisions are being issued.
704,1981-82,As a further step in facilitating investment in industry we have decided to relax the requirement under the Stock Exchange guidelines that promoters can only hold a maximum of 40 per cent of the equity of a new company.
705,1981-82,This provision conflicted in some cases with the requirement of the financial institutions that promoters put up a minimum percentage of the total cost of the project.
706,1981-82,This potential contradiction between two different requirements had given rise to considerable difficulties in the implementation of new projects.
707,1981-82,"In order to overcome these problems, promoters will be allowed to hold higher equity than the 40 per cent limit during the initial stages of a project."
708,1981-82,"However, equity holdings above 40 per cent will have to be divested within three years from the date of commercial production by an offer of sale to the general public."
709,1981-82,This rationalisation should speed up the implementation of new projects in industry.
710,1981-82,I am confident that these wideranging measures will help to encourage the flow of savings into the financial system and increase the availability of funds for industrial investment.
711,1981-82,They create highly favourable conditions for growth in the coming year.
712,1981-82,"Having outlined the broad approach I have adopted in formulating the Budget and some associated policy initiatives, I will now turn to the Revised estimates for 198081 and the Budget estimates for 198182."
713,1981-82,REVISED ESTIMATES FOR 198081 36.
714,1981-82,"The Budget estimates for 198081 had envisaged a deficit of Rs 1,445 crores."
715,1981-82,"However, as a result of discussions between the States and the Planning Commission, the State Plan outlays were increased in a number of cases."
716,1981-82,Central assistance for State Plans was increased by Rs 310 crores.
717,1981-82,We have also to provide additional assistance of Rs 58 crores to the Rural Electrification Corporation.
718,1981-82,The provision of shortterm loans to the States for supply of agricultural inputs also had to be increased by Rs 25 crores.
719,1981-82,"In addition, the Central Government has to provide assistance of Rs 90 crores to the States to help in flood relief work."
720,1981-82,Special loan assistance of Rs 76 7 crores is being provided to certain North Eastern States including Assam to meet the gap in their resources caused by their exceptional difficulties.
721,1981-82,A larger provision for subsidies is being made than originally envisaged.
722,1981-82,The provision for net outgo on imported fertilisers is being increased by Rs 104 crores.
723,1981-82,"The provision for food subsidy, subsidy on controlled cloth and provision for cash compensatory support and market development for exports are also being increased by Rs 110 crores."
724,1981-82,The provision for Defence expenditure has to be increased by Rs 200 crores.
725,1981-82,The financial position of certain public sector undertakings did not show the recovery anticipated at the Budget stage.
726,1981-82,Additional nonPlan assistance of Rs 104 crores to these undertakings has therefore become necessary.
727,1981-82,"Turning to the Central Plan expenditure, I am happy to inform the House that expenditure in crucial sectors like power, coal and petroleum has been satisfactory."
728,1981-82,"The House will also be happy to note that the level of disbursements of the Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation has far exceeded the initial Budget estimates, and I am, therefore, providing an additional sum of Rs 126 crores to the Corporation."
729,1981-82,An additional provision of Rs 50 crores is being made for industrial Development Bank of India to enable it to meet its rising commitments.
730,1981-82,"In certain sectors like steel and civil aviation, there has been a shortfall in internal resources generation and budgetary support for their Plans has to be significantly stepped up."
731,1981-82,There may be some shortfalls in the Plan expenditure in some sectors.
732,1981-82,"However, even after taking these into account, the budgetary support for the Central Plan in 198081 will be Rs 297 crores higher in the Revised estimates."
733,1981-82,"The total expenditure of the Central Government is now estimated at Rs 22,808 crores compared with Rs 21,467 crores in the Budget."
734,1981-82,"Turning to receipts, I am happy to inform the House that despite the concessions in income tax allowed in the Budget for 198081, tax revenues have not suffered."
735,1981-82,My judgement that lower rate of taxation will promote better voluntary compliance seems to have been vindicated.
736,1981-82,The receipts from Corporation tax would be higher by Rs 35 crores compared with the Budget estimate of Rs 1515 crores.
737,1981-82,Receipts from Union Excise duties are also estimated to be higher by Rs 99 crores compated with the Budget estimate of Rs 8265 crores.
738,1981-82,The receipts from Customs duties are likely to exceed the Budget estimate of Rs 2989 crores by as much as Rs 361 crores in the current year due to larger imports and higher international prices.
739,1981-82,"After deducting the States’ share of various taxes, the net tax revenue of the Centre is now estimated to be Rs 419 crores more than the Budget estimate of Rs 8922 crores."
740,1981-82,"Capital receipts too, show an improvement of Rs 245 crores over the Budget estimate of Rs 7,694 crores."
741,1981-82,"This is because of higher market borrowing of 8 Re.104 crores and estimated receipts of Rs 200 crores from the sale of Special Bearer Bonds, offset by some shortfalls elsewhere."
742,1981-82,"Total receipts are now estimated at Rs 20,833 crores compared with the Budget estimates of Rs 20,022 crores."
743,1981-82,The current year is now expected to close with a deficit of about Rs 1.975 crores.
744,1981-82,The House will appreciate that almost the entire increase in the budgetary deficit is accounted for by larger budgetary support for State and Central Plans.
745,1981-82,BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 198182 46.
746,1981-82,"The Budget for 198182 reflects the objectives, priorities and programmes of the Sixth Plan."
747,1981-82,"Plan outlays of the Centre, States and Union Territories in 1981.82 wee estimated at Rs 17,479 crores compared with Rs 14,593 crores in Budget estimates 198081."
748,1981-82,This represents an increase of nearly 20 per cent.
749,1981-82,"The Plan outlay of the Centre for 198182 is being stepped up very considerably to Rs 8,619 crores from Rs 7,340 crores in Budget estimates 198081, an increase of 17.4 per cent."
750,1981-82,"This will be financed by budgetary support of Rs 6,309 crores, and internal and extra budgetary resources of Public Sector Undertakings of Rs 2310 crores."
751,1981-82,"The total of the approved Plan outlays of States and Union Territories will be Rs 8,860 crores as against Rs 7,253 crores in Budget estimates 198081, that is, an increase of 22 per cent."
752,1981-82,"A provision of Rs 3,462 crores has been made for Central assistance for the Plans of the States and Union Territories."
753,1981-82,Agriculture has a preponderant role in our economy and its development sets the pace for the economy as a whole.
754,1981-82,"The Annual Plan outlay for agriculture in the Central and State Plans has been stepped up to Rs 1,047 crores from Rs 925 crores in Budget estimates 198081."
755,1981-82,Expansion of the area under irrigation is the most important single factor enabling a shift to high productivity scientific farming.
756,1981-82,Accordingly it is proposed to add 2.5 million hectares under irrigation in 198182.
757,1981-82,The outlay for major and medium irrigation in the Annual Plan of the Centre and States for 198182 is being raised substantially to Rs 1408 crores from Rs 1213 crores in Budget 198081.
758,1981-82,The outlay on minor irrigation will be Rs 301 crores compared with Rs 286 crores in 198081.
759,1981-82,"Parallel with the effort at boosting total agricultural production, the Annual Plan lays great stress on special programmes to benefit the weaker sections of rural society such as landless labour small and marginal farmers, rural artisans and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes."
760,1981-82,One of the important programmes which this Government has launched for this purpose is the National Rural Employment Programme.
761,1981-82,We are providing Rs 180 crores in the Central Plan for this programme and this will be matched by an equal amount from the States.
762,1981-82,Another important initiative aimed at helping the weaker sections is the integrated Rural Development Programme.
763,1981-82,"This programme absorbs the earlier complementary, and sometimes overlapping programmes aimed at particular sections 9 of the population."
764,1981-82,We have provided Rs 198 crores for this programme as well as for special programmes such as Desert Development and Drought Prone Area Programmes.
765,1981-82,"With an equivalent contribution from the States, it is expected that the integrated Rural Development Programme will help 3 million families to go above the poverty line in 198182."
766,1981-82,Central assistance for the Special Component Plans for Scheduled Castes was introduced in the very first Budget of the present Government.
767,1981-82,We have provided Rs 110 crores for the next year.
768,1981-82,"In addition, Rs 13 crores will be invested in the Scheduled Castes Development Corporations of States."
769,1981-82,"Along with an equal contribution from the States, this will enable these Corporations to raise substantial funds from the financing institutions."
770,1981-82,"The tribal subplan, which is the vehicle for the development of tribal areas will receive an augmented provision of Rs 85 crores during 198182, compared with Rs 70 crores in 198081."
771,1981-82,A provision of Rs 92 crores has been made for the Special Hill Development Programme compared with Rs 61 crores in 198081.
772,1981-82,"In pursuance of the Government’s policy to accelerate the provision of safe drinking water in problem villages, an amount of Rs 110 crores has been allocated in."
773,1981-82,"Together with the provisions made in the State Plans, this would enable about 38, 000 additional villages to be covered during the next year."
774,1981-82,"The Annual Plan accords high priority to the all important task of expanding capacities in sectors such as oil, coal and power."
775,1981-82,It is proposed to provide Rs 580 crores for coal and lignite projects in 198182.
776,1981-82,This represents an increase of 31 per cent over the provision of Rs 443 crores in 198081.
777,1981-82,Large increases have also been made in the outlay for power in the Central Plan.
778,1981-82,We have provided Rs 721 crores in 1981 82 compared to Rs 520 crores in the last Budget.
779,1981-82,This reflects the expanding role of the Centre in the power sector.
780,1981-82,We propose to take up the Dulhasti Project in Jammu and Kashmir and the Koel Karo project in Bihar in the Central sector in the coming year.
781,1981-82,The total outlay for the power sector in the State and Central Plans taken together is Rs 3326 crores compared to Ra. 2745 crores provided in the Plan for 1980 81.
782,1981-82,Additional generating capacity of 3000 MW is expected to be commissioned during 198182.
783,1981-82,"The Rural electrification programme provides for electrification of 22,000 villages and energisation of 4.25 Iakh pumpsets in the coming year."
784,1981-82,"In keeping with the high priority accorded to exploration and development of on and natural gas resources, the Plan outlay for the petroleum sector has been increased to Rs 1011 crores in 198182 compared with Rs 780 crores in the current year."
785,1981-82,An outlay of Rs 67 crores is proposed in the petrochemical sector.
786,1981-82,"An outlay of, Rs 796 crores is being provided for steel in 198182."
787,1981-82,A significant development in this area is the recent commissioning of the Demonstration Plant for Sponge Iron Production at Kothagudem.
788,1981-82,This project is of special significance 10 to India since the technology for production of sponge iron by using noncoking coal will enable us to overcome the constraints imposed by the limited reserves of coking coal in our country.
789,1981-82,The Annual Plan for 1981 82 envisages a significantly higher outlay of Rs  223 crores for minerals development against Rs 130 crores in 198081.
790,1981-82,This includes a provision of Rs 90 crores for the Orissa Aluminium Project which will be implemented by the new National Aluminium Company registered with headquarters at Bhubaneswar in Orissa.
791,1981-82,The bulk of the project cost is expected to be financed by external credit and commercial borrowings.
792,1981-82,"In tune with our concern for improving transport facilities, we have enhanced the outlay in the Central Plan for the transport sector to Rs 1535 crores from Ra.1351 crores in 198081."
793,1981-82,Hon’ble Members are already aware that a substantial increase has been made in the Plan outlay of the Railways from Rs 760 crores in 198081 to Rs 980 crores.
794,1981-82,"A provision of Rs 108 crores has been made for the development of ports which includes construction of additional berths sit Kandla, Tuticorin and Visakhapatnam."
795,1981-82,In tune with our drive to improve and modernise communication facilities.
796,1981-82,It is proposed to extend 2 lakhs direct telephone connections during 198182.
797,1981-82,An outlay of Rs 518 crores for Posts and Telegraphs including communications has been provided in the Plan.
798,1981-82,"An outlay of Rs 390 crores is being provided for chemicals and fertilisers which includes substantial provision for the gasbased fertiliser projects at Thal Vtishet, Hazira and Namrup."
799,1981-82,Proposals for new nitrogenous and phosphatic fertilisers plants are also being finalised.
800,1981-82,Village and small industries have an immense potential for providing employment while sustaining the traditional arts and skills of the village artisans and craftsmen.
801,1981-82,An outlay of Rs 162 crores has been earmarked for these sectors adding to the outlays of Rs 153 crores in the Plans of the States and Union Territories.
802,1981-82,Finally I cope to the an important question of population growth.
803,1981-82,All our efforts at eradicating poverty will be frustrated if we cannot reduce the rate of population growth.
804,1981-82,We have taken up revitalisation of the Family Welfare Programme in earnest.
805,1981-82,A provision of Rs 155 crores is being made for this programme in 198182.
806,1981-82,The Government is deeply concerned about the lack of adequate communication facilities in the NorthEast.
807,1981-82,It has also been decided to establish a more direct connection from Nowgong to Dimapur on National Highway No. 36 at a cost of Re.16 crores.
808,1981-82,Certain missing links on the road running along the indoBangladesh Border in Meghalaya will be completed at a cost of Rs 26 crores.
809,1981-82,Railway facilities in this area are also being augmented.
810,1981-82,Hon’ble 11 Members are aware that the Third Level Air Service has already started funtioning in the NorthEastern Region.
811,1981-82,NonPlan expenditure has been subjected to careful scrutiny to keep it to the minimum.
812,1981-82,Defence expenditure is estimated at Rs 4200 crores as against Rs 3800 crores in the current year.
813,1981-82,I am sure the House will agree with me that in these difficult times the reasonable requirements of defence should be fully met.
814,1981-82,"A provision of Rs 3124 crores is being made for interest payments as against Rs 2685 crores in the current year, the increase being mainly on account of internal debt."
815,1981-82,"Due to the increase in prices of naphtha and other inputs, the cost of production of indigenous fertilisers has also gone up."
816,1981-82,The cost of imported fertilisers has also increased.
817,1981-82,"Accordingly, the Budget for 198182 provides for a higher subsidy on fertilisers of Rs 679 crores as against Rs 468 crores in the current year."
818,1981-82,Provision for nonPlan loans to public sector undertakings has been reduced from Rs 454 crores in the current year to Rs 318 crores in view of the anticipated improvement in their performance and financial position in the next year.
819,1981-82,A lump sum provision of Rs 200 crores is also being made in next year’s Budget to cover the incidence of additional expenditure on dearness allowance to Central Government employees.
820,1981-82,"In future, dearness relief to pensioners will be paid at the rate of 2.5 per cent of pension for each 8 point rise in the consumer price index instead of at the rate of 5 per cent for each 16 point rise as at present."
821,1981-82,The procedure for payment of dearness relief to pensioners is also being streamlined.
822,1981-82,These changes will mitigate the hardships faced by pensioners.
823,1981-82,Hon’ble Members are aware that India will have the privilege of holding the next Asian Games in 1982 in the capital.
824,1981-82,The expenditure necessary next year for the games is being provided in the budgets of the Ministries concerned.
825,1981-82,"Most of the expenditure will be on improvement and creation of permanent assets like roads, stadia, and other sports facilities."
826,1981-82,The total nonPlan expenditure for 198182 is estimated at Rs 15100 crores compared with Rs 13736 crores in the current year.
827,1981-82,"As regards receipts for 198182, the gross tax revenues at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 14472 crores compared with Rs 13133 crores in the current year, showing an increase of Rs 1339 crores over the Revised estimates."
828,1981-82,The States’ share of taxes in 198182 is estimated at Rs 4206 crores compared with Rs 3792 crores in the current year.
829,1981-82,Consequently the Centre’s net tax revenue will be Rs 10266 crores as against Rs 9341 crores in the current year.
830,1981-82,The receipts from market loans are estimated at Rs 2800 crores compared with Rs 2604 crores in the current year.
831,1981-82,Small savings are estimated to yield Rs 1250 crores next year compared with Rs 1100 crores in the current year.
832,1981-82,"External assistance, net of loan repayments, is estimated at Rs 1379 crores as compared with Rs 1258 12 crores in the current year."
833,1981-82,A credit of Rs 800 crores has also been taken for receipt from sale of Special Bearer Bonds in the next financial year.
834,1981-82,"Taking into account the effect of the changes in the fare and freight rates of railways, changes in the P&T tariff to which I will refer a little later and the continuance of the Compulsory Deposit Scheme for incometax Payers beyond 31.3.1981, the total receipts for 198182 are estimated at Rs 23061 crores."
835,1981-82,The total expenditure for next year is estimated at Rs 24871 crores.
836,1981-82,The overall budgetary gap at the existing rates of taxation will thus be Rs 1810 crores.
837,1981-82,Incometax and other direct taxes are important instruments for raising resources and reducing disparities.
838,1981-82,We propose to achieve these objectives by plugging of legal loopholes and effective administration rather than by enhancement of rates which often leads to tax evasion and generation of black money.
839,1981-82,My proposals are also designed to further our Party’s avowed policy of affording relief to the middle classes in these difficult times.
840,1981-82,"Hon’ble Members will recall thdt last year the exemption limit, for income tax on personal incomes was raised to Rs 12, 000."
841,1981-82,"But the nil slab rate was retained at Rs 8,000."
842,1981-82,"The House will be glad to know that I propose to raise the exemption limit for incometax in the case of noncorporate taxpayers other than registered firms and Hindu undivided families with one or more members having separate income exceeding the exemption limit, from Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000."
843,1981-82,"With a view to providing significant relief to middle income groups, 1 further propose to raise the nil rate slab from Rs 8.000 to Rs 15,000 and also restructure the rate schedule up to Rs 30,000."
844,1981-82,"The rate of income tax on the slab of Rs 15,001 to Rs 25,000 will be 30 per cent and on the slab of Rs 25,001 to Rs 30,000, 34 per cent."
845,1981-82,The rates of incometax on higher slabs will remain unchanged.
846,1981-82,"As a result of these changes, about 14 lakhs of taxpayers will go out of the income tax net."
847,1981-82,I venture to claim that never have so many people been freed from the burden of income taxation at one stroke.
848,1981-82,"Apart from this, another 11.5 lakhs of taxpayers in the income brackets of Rs 15,001 to Rs 30,000 will also get varying degrees of relief."
849,1981-82,"The reduction in the tax liebility at income level of Rs 15,000 will be Rs 990; at Rs 20,000, Rs 495 and at Rs 25,000, Rs 220."
850,1981-82,"There will be no change in the tax liability in the case of taxpayers having income exceeding Rs 30,000."
851,1981-82,Thus I have provided in me year incometax exemption and /or reduction to over 25 lakhs of incometax assessees out of about 40 lakhs of assessees in the country.
852,1981-82,"At present, salaried taxpayers are entitled to a standard deduction in an amount equal per cent of the salary upto"
853,1981-82,"Rs 10,000 and 10 per cent of the balance subject to an overall ceiling limit of Rs 3,500."
854,1981-82,These limits were fixed in 1974.
855,1981-82,"In view of the subsequent rise in prices, and as a means of relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to enhance the rate of standard deduction to 20 per cent subject to a higher ceiling of Rs 5,000."
856,1981-82,Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that this benefit will be 13 applicable to pensioners also.
857,1981-82,"At present, employees in receipt of conveyance allowance are entitled to a standard deduction of Rs 1,000 only."
858,1981-82,It is now proposed that they should be given the benefit of full standard deduction.
859,1981-82,"In view of the urgent need to raise the level of savings in the economy, 1 propose to continue the Compulsory Deposit Scheme for incometax Payers for another two years."
860,1981-82,The corporate sector has a crucial role to play in the growth of the national economy.
861,1981-82,I have earlier in my speech referred to the various steps taken for improving the climate for investment in industry.
862,1981-82,I now propose to reduce by 5 per cent the surcharge on incometax payable by all classes of companies i.e. from 7.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent.
863,1981-82,This will add to the internal availability of funds in the corporate sector and should improve the scope for investment financing from their own resources.
864,1981-82,This step will reinforce the impact of the measuredwhich I have indicated earlier for mobilising financial resources for industrial investment.
865,1981-82,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, all categories oftaxpayers are required to pay advance tax m payasyouearn basis."
866,1981-82,"Surtax is, however, not payable by companies in advance."
867,1981-82,I propose to remove this anomaly and provide that surtax will also be payable in advance during the financial year preceding the relevant assessment year.
868,1981-82,The Eleventh Schedule to the incometax Act contains a list of industries which do not qualify for specified investment related tax concessions under the incometax Act.
869,1981-82,"For example, investment allowance or tax holiday is not admissible in respect of these industries unless they are in the smallscale sector."
870,1981-82,Industries included in this Schedule were originally considered to be of low priority.
871,1981-82,"However, on reviewing the list, I do not find any justification for treating many of the listed industries as of low priority."
872,1981-82,"Accordingly, 14 groups of industries will be removed from this Schedule and will now become eligible for the specified tax concessions."
873,1981-82,"These industries include electric fans, pressure cookers, glass and glassware, pigments, colours, paints, enamels, varnishes, blacks and cellulose lacquers, chinaware and porcelainware, mosaic tiles and glazed tiles, synthetic detergents, amplifiers or any other apparatus used for addressing the public, vacuum flasks and other vacuum vessels, etc."
874,1981-82,"These industries, some of which have export potential, will now become eligible for the specified tax concessions."
875,1981-82,Hon’ble Members will recall that the Government had taken several measures last year to curb the use of private discretionary trusts as a device for tax avoidance.
876,1981-82,Another tax avoidance device that has come to the notice of the Government is the creation of oral trust.
877,1981-82,"With a view to checking this abuse, I propose to subject oral trusts to incometax at the maximum marginal rate and to wealthtax at the flat rate of 3 per cent or at the appropriate rate applicable in the case of an individual, whichever course is more beneficial to the revenue."
878,1981-82,This proposal will take effect from the assessment year 198182.
879,1981-82,Another device being used for avoiding proper tax liability is the creation of associations of persons without defining the shares of members.
880,1981-82,"This enables the creation of a large number of taxable entities which, under the existing law, will be chargeable to incometax separately."
881,1981-82,"I now propose that such associations of persons be charged to incometax at the maximum marginal rate and to wealthtax at the flat rate of 3 per cent or at the appropriate rate applicable in the case of an individual, whichever is higher."
882,1981-82,This proposal will also take effect from the assessment year 198182.
883,1981-82,"Earlier in my speech, I have referred to the prospective participation of foreign companies in the field of oil exploration and production."
884,1981-82,"In this connection, it is necessary to take several steps relating to tax matters."
885,1981-82,"Firstly, it is proposed to extend."
886,1981-82,"Secondly, it is proposed to insert suitable provisions in the incometax Act and the Companies Profits Surtax Act to enable the Central Government to provide, by a notification in the Official Gazette for an exemption, reduction in rate or other modification in respect of incometax or surtax in favour of any class of persons engaged in the business of mineral oils and gas in association with the Central Government or any person authorised by it."
887,1981-82,Notifications under the new provisions when made will be placed on the Table of both the Houses of Parliament.
888,1981-82,It is also proposed to amend section 42 of the incometax Act relating to special provision for deductions in the case of business of the prospecting for or extraction or production of mineral oils so as to extend its scope to cover cases where the Government itself does not participate in such business but does so through any person authorised by it.
889,1981-82,"While the search for additional quantities of oil should continue with unabated vigour, there is also an urgent need to accelerate the development and use of renewable energy resources and to promote their utilisation."
890,1981-82,"The renewable energy sources which have already been brought to the threshold of commercial use by our scientists and engineers include solar, biomass and wind energy."
891,1981-82,Some fiscal incentives to promote use of these nonconventional forms of energy are called for.
892,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to enhance the depreciation allowance on machinery or plant installed for manufacturing renewable energy devices and systems from 10 per cent available at present to 30 per cent."
893,1981-82,Depreciation on renewable energy devices and systems used for business or profession will also be allowed at the enhanced rate.
894,1981-82,Other measures under contemplation by the Government include long to the relevant industries on suitable terms from financial institutions and exemption from certain taxes and duties.
895,1981-82,"To encourage establishment of exportoriented industries in the Free Trade Zone, the Government proposes to allow complete tax holiday in respect of units set up in these Zones for an initial period of five years in lieu of other concessions."
896,1981-82,Tea is one of our important exportoriented industries.
897,1981-82,"At present, development allowance equal to 50 per cent of the expenditure incurred on plantation of tea bushes inany new area or on any land which has been previously abandoned is allowed in computing the income from tea business."
898,1981-82,"For this purpose, the expenditure qualifying for development allowance is restricted to Rs 12,500 per hectare of land situated in hilly areas and Rs 10,000 per hectare in other areas."
899,1981-82,"Having regard to the increase in the cost of planting in recent years, I propose to raise these ceiling limits to Rs 40,000 per hectare of land situated in Darjeeling district, Rs 35,000 per hectare in respect of land situated in other hilly areas and Rs 30,000 per hectare in plains."
900,1981-82,"Under section 35B of the income tax Act, domestic companies and non corporate taxpayers resident in India are entitled to a weighted deduction in the computation of the taxable profits at the rate of one and onethird times the amount of qualifying expenditure incurred by them on development of export markets."
901,1981-82,The scope of this provision was curtailed last year as it had been misused for claiming a weighted deduction in respect of expenditure incurred in India on activities which had no direct relation with the basic objective of development of export markets.
902,1981-82,"In order to guard against such misuse, while at the same time protecting all legitimate effort at export market development, the Government is framing rules which will identify a number of specific activities to be allowed under section 35B."
903,1981-82,The necessary notification in this behalf will be issued shortly.
904,1981-82,Electronics is both a labourintensive and exportoriented industry.
905,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to include the electronic component industry in the Ninth Schedule to the incometax Act and provide that dividends derived by a domestic company from an Indian company engaged exclusively in the manufacture of electronic components will be completely exempt from incometax."
906,1981-82,The smallscale industrial undertakings enjoy certain tax concessions under the income tax Act.
907,1981-82,"For this purpose, an industrial undertaking is regarded as a small scale industrial undertaking if the aggregate value of the machinery and plant installed therein as on the last day of the previous year does not exceed Rs 10 lakhs."
908,1981-82,I now propose to raise this limit to Rs 20 lakhs in line with the new definition of a small scale industry.
909,1981-82,"Under the existing law, in computing taxable income, a deduction equal to 20 per cent of the profits and gains derived from the business of publication of books is allowed."
910,1981-82,I propose to extend this concession for a period of five years with effect from assessment year 198182.
911,1981-82,"At present, approved financial corporations and public housing finance companies are entitled to a deduction in respect of the specified percentage of income carried to special reserve, subject to certain conditions."
912,1981-82,"The aggregate of the amounts qualifying for such deduction is, however, subject to an overall ceiling equal to the 16 amount of the paidup share capital."
913,1981-82,"In order to enable such corporations and companies to buildup such reserves further, I propose to double the present ceiling."
914,1981-82,"Under the existing law, resident individuals and Hindu undivided families are entitled to a deduction in respect of medical treatment of physically or mentally handicapped dependants."
915,1981-82,"I propose to double the amount of this deduction to Rs 4,800 in respect of a dependant who is hospitalised for a period of 182 days or more during the relevant accounting year and Rs 1,200 in other cases."
916,1981-82,The House will doubtless welcome this concession being given in the international Year for the Disabled Persons.
917,1981-82,I propose to give some significant concessions under the Estate Duty Act.
918,1981-82,"The present limit of Rs 50,000 for estate duty was fixed in 1958."
919,1981-82,I propose to raise it to Rs 1.5 lakhs the same as under the Wealthtax Act.
920,1981-82,I also propose to provide that one residential house or part thereof will be valued for estate duty purposes on the same basis as for the purposes of wealth tax.
921,1981-82,"Since the Estate Duty Act can be amended only with the concurrence of State Legislatures, a Bill for giving effect to these proposals will be introduced later."
922,1981-82,I propose to make certain amendments in the incometax Act to upgrade the qualifications for appointment as members of the incometax Appellate Tribunal.
923,1981-82,Other amendments to the direct tax laws are of minor significance.
924,1981-82,I would not like to take up the time of the House by referring to them in detail here.
925,1981-82,The reduction in the rates and other concessions in respect of income tax on personal incomes would result in a loss of Rs 146 crores in a full year and Rs 115 crores during 198182.
926,1981-82,"Having regard to the pattern of sharing of incometax between Centre and States, these concessions will entail a loss of revenue of Rs 29 crores to the Centre in 198182."
927,1981-82,The loss of revenue on account of reduction in the rates of corporation tax and other concessions to companies will largely be balanced by the payment of surtax in advance by companies.
928,1981-82,"I am, therefore, not assuming any loss of revenue on this score for 198182."
929,1981-82,I now turn to my proposals on indirect taxes.
930,1981-82,My basic approach is that additional revenue should flow largely from increased production.
931,1981-82,"However, there is need to mobilise additional resources to finance the Sixth Plan."
932,1981-82,While seeking to raise additional resources I have nevertheless kept in mind the imperative need to avoid hardship to the middle and poorer sections of consumers and to provide a larger measure of relief to the smallscale sector of our industry.
933,1981-82,"Taking Customs duties first, my principal proposal relates to auxiliary duties of customs."
934,1981-82,This duty has been levied on an annual basis since the 1973 Budget.
935,1981-82,While continuing this levy I also propose to raise the rates of auxiliary duties as a measure of additional resource mobilisation.
936,1981-82,In recent years we have been following a fairly liberal import policy.
937,1981-82,The difficult balance of payments outlook points to the need for conserving foreign exchange.
938,1981-82,"The tariff mechanism judiciously used, can 17 help conserve foreign exchange and also raise some revenue."
939,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to increase the rates of auxiliary duties by 5 per cent ad valorem, on all categories of imports with a few wellmerited exceptions."
940,1981-82,This will obviate a sharp increase in the landed cost of any particular article.
941,1981-82,Auxiliary duties of customs are now leviable on imported goods broadly on a threetier basis.
942,1981-82,"Items subject to a basic duty upto 60 per cent ad valorem, for example, basic raw materials, bear an auxiliary duty of 5 per cent ad valorem; on items such as semiprocessed goods and intermediates, where the rate of basic duty is 60 per cent ad valorem or above but less than 100 per cent, the rate of auxiliary duty is 15 per cent ad valorem; and where the rate of basic duty is 100 per cent ad valorem or above such as on finished consumer goods, the rate of auxiliary duty is 20 per cent ad valorem."
943,1981-82,"In other cases the rate of auxiliary duty is 5 per cent ad valorem, except crude petroleum on which the rate is Rs 9.50 per metric tonne."
944,1981-82,There are also some items which are fully exempt from auxiliary duty.
945,1981-82,My proposal is to increase the rate of auxiliary duty to 10 per cent ad valorem wherever the rate of auxiliary duty is now 5 per cent; to 20 per cent ad valorem wherever is now 15 per cent; and to 25 per cent ad valorem wherever the rate is now 20 per cent.
946,1981-82,"I do not, however, propose to increase the auxiliary duty on crude petroleum."
947,1981-82,"In line with the approach I have explained, I propose to withdraw the present full exemption from auxiliary duties of customs in respect of certain items of capital equipment and subject them to auxiliary duty of customs at the rate of 5 per cent ad valorem."
948,1981-82,"This increase would cover, among other things, imports of machinery as project imports as also items of machinery on which the concessional rate of 25 per cent ad valorem is applied."
949,1981-82,"This measure would, apart from yielding additional revenue, afford some additional protection to the indigenous machine building industry which has, of late, had to face a significant escalation in input costs 98."
950,1981-82,I said earlier that I would exclude some items from the proposed increase in the auxiliary duties of customs imports of essential items likeedible oil will be exempted from the proposed increase.
951,1981-82,Bulk petroleum products such as kerosene and high speed diesel oil and steel imported for buffer stock operations will also not attract the increased levy.
952,1981-82,Items on which import duty rates have been changed in the recent past with a view to maintaining parity with prices of domestic products have also been kept out of the purview of the increased levy.
953,1981-82,Further keeping in view our commitments under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
954,1981-82,I propose to give up the auxiliary duty in respect of three items involving a small revenue sacrifice.
955,1981-82,Further details of the proposals are available in the Budget Papers.
956,1981-82,These proposals are expected to yield an additional revenue of about Rs 250 crores.
957,1981-82,My next proposal relates to levy of import duty on newsprint.
958,1981-82,At present 18    this item is fully exempt.
959,1981-82,There is a large foreign exchange outgo on imports of newsprint.
960,1981-82,There is no reason why this commodity should not bear a moderate rate of customs duty.
961,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to impose an effective customs duty of 15 per cent ad valorem on imported newsprint."
962,1981-82,I expect this measure to yield an additional revenue of about Rs 21crores. 101.
963,1981-82,Imports of stainless steel bars and wire rods now attract a duty of 75 per cent because they have industrial applications.
964,1981-82,But there is reason to believe that some of these imports are being diverted for rerolling into strips and sheets used in the manufacture of utensils.
965,1981-82,"I, there fore, propose to raise the effective customs duty on stainless steel bars and wire rods from 75 per cent to 175 per cent ad valorem."
966,1981-82,"I have, however, taken care to see that this increase does not affect imports of stainless steel wire rods which are used for the drawing of wires."
967,1981-82,This measure is expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 5 crores.
968,1981-82,I also propose to raise the basic customs duty on plain shaft bearings from 60 per cent to 100 per cent ad valorem.
969,1981-82,"This increase should help to restrict large scale imports of bearings such as thinwalled bearings, which have been affecting the indigenous industry."
970,1981-82,This proposal is expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 2.75 crores.
971,1981-82,On similar considerations it is proposed to raise the basic customs duty on computers and computer peripherals from 40 per cent to 50 per cent ad valorem.
972,1981-82,The likely revenue gain from this increase would be Rs 1 crore.
973,1981-82,I will now come to excise duties.
974,1981-82,"The House will recall that in 1978 the Additional Excise Duties Textiles and Textile Articles Act was passed, in terms of which an additional duty of excise was levied on certain textiles and textile articles at 10 per cent of the basic excise duty leviable."
975,1981-82,The revenue from this excise levy was intended to meet the expenditure incurred by way of subsidy on controlled cloth.
976,1981-82,"The production of controlled cloth is being stepped up, with emphasis on larger production of dhotis and sarees which are of special significance to the poorer sections of society, particularly in rural areas."
977,1981-82,"As a result, the provision for subsidy under this scheme would rise to nearly Rs 100 crores in the coming year."
978,1981-82,The revenue at the existing rate of additional excise duty is only about Rs 66 crores.
979,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to raise the rate of additional excise duty from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of the basic excise duty on all the items which are now covered by the levy."
980,1981-82,This would yield an additional amount of about Rs 33 crores and help finance the increased outlay on controlled cloth.
981,1981-82,"As regards special excise duties, I propose only to continue them at the existing rates."
982,1981-82,The exemptions in force are also being continued.
983,1981-82,My remaining proposals under Union excise duties are mainly designed to achieve simplification and greater clarity.
984,1981-82,"Hon’ble Members would be aware that there is a graded structure of duty on matches, the mechanised sector paying Rs 7.20 per gross boxes, the middle sector paying Rs 4.50 and the cottage sector Rs 1.60."
985,1981-82,"In the light of the report of the Dandekar Committee and a special study made by the Government, it has become necessary to discourage a tendency of middle sector units towards mechanisation of certain labour intensive processes."
986,1981-82,"Accordingly, I propose that the concessional rates of duty i.e. Rs 4.50 for middle sector units and Rs 1.60 for cottage units, will not be available if pawer is used in the labourintensive processes of framefilling, dipping splints in match composition, box making, box filling, labelling and bande rolling and packaging if such units use power for any of the above processes, they will be liable to a duty rate of Rs 5.50 per gross boxes, which would be intermediate between the rate."
987,1981-82,I would like to stress that this is not intended as a revenue measure.
988,1981-82,"It is intended only to protect through the excise mechanism, the employment potential of the nonmechanised sector’."
989,1981-82,"With a view to preventing the possible infiltration of the middle sector into the cottage sector and in order to ensure that the benefit of the lowest rate of duty accrues to genuine cottage sector units, it is Proposed to reimpose a ceiling on the clearances by cottage sector units at concessional rates."
990,1981-82,"The new ceiling, which is proposed to be fixed at 120 million matches per unit per annum, is much more liberal than the ceiling of 75 million that existed prior to the 1980 Budget."
991,1981-82,The pattern of production and clearance will be kept under watch and this ceiling will be reviewed if circumstances so warrant.
992,1981-82,The changes I have proposed are fair to all segments of the industry and are designed to promote both employment and production in the best possible manner.
993,1981-82,"Another rationalisation measure relates to the concession available to manufacturers of goods falling under Tariff Item 68, who undertake work on ‘job’ basis."
994,1981-82,Under the present scheme duty is being effectively collected only on the ‘job charges’ paid by the principal manufacturer to the job worker.
995,1981-82,"In the operation of the scheme, however, several difficulties have been experienced, particularly on the question of what is ‘job work’."
996,1981-82,There have been cases where some manufacturers have taken undue advantage of the concession.
997,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to replace the present scheme by me in which, instead of levying duty separately on the job charges paid to the job worker, the duty will be paid by the principal manufacturer on the value of the finished goods."
998,1981-82,This step should be generally welcomed by ancillary units which undertake work on job basis.
999,1981-82,"I also propose to rationalise the Central Excise tariff entry and the rate structure relating to tyres with a view to making the legislative intent clearer and minimising the scope for disputes in classification and assessment, particularly in regard to offtheroad tyres used in bulldozers, scrappers and other earth moving equipments."
1000,1981-82,"While proposing the necessary amendments, I have taken care to maintain 20  the existing rates of duties and duty concessions in respect of tyres both for agricultural tractors and their trailers."
1001,1981-82,The other major area where rationalisation of the tariff entries has been proposed is in regard to nonferrous metals under the respective entries in the Central Excise Tariff.
1002,1981-82,There has been considerable debate and dispute m the question of assessment of waste and scrap of these metals.
1003,1981-82,To set these at rest it is proposed to specifically cover waste and scrap of these metals under the respective tariff entries.
1004,1981-82,"In addition to the above, a few other amendments to certain tariff entries as also the insertion of a separate tariff item for polyester film have been proposed."
1005,1981-82,The details of these changes may be seen from the Budget papers.
1006,1981-82,I now turn to a proposal which seeks to fulfil a longstanding demand of State Governments.
1007,1981-82,"The scheme of levy of additional excise duty in lieu of salestax is at present applicable to sugar, tobacco and some textile items."
1008,1981-82,The National Development Council had recommended that the revenue yield from Central excise duties and additional excise duties be in the ratio of 2:1 as far as possible.
1009,1981-82,"At a Conference of Chief Ministers, I gave an assurance that an effort would be made to achieve this ratio in respect of these commodities as a whole."
1010,1981-82,I have considered how best this assurance can be fulfilled.
1011,1981-82,The simplest solution will be to make a change in the ratio for sharing of revenues from cigarettes as between the Centre and the States.
1012,1981-82,"As against the present ratio of 76:24 between; basic excise duty and additional excise duty in the composite rate applicable to cigarettes, the ratio is proposed to be changed to 72.5:27.5."
1013,1981-82,This will be combined with a uniform increase in the specific duty element in the ‘composite rate from Rs 21.00 to Rs 21.25 per thousand.
1014,1981-82,The overall revenue from cigarettes will remain practically unchanged.
1015,1981-82,"There should, therefore, be no justification for manufacturers to mark up the prices of cigarettes."
1016,1981-82,"With these changes, the overall ratio between the yields from basic and special excise duties m the me hand and additional excise duties m the other is expected to improve to 2:1 taking the three items sugar tobacco and textiles together."
1017,1981-82,This will result in a transfer of about Rs 21.72 crores from revenues under Central excise to the revenue under additional excise duty.
1018,1981-82,I have also a minor proposal which is basically of interest to the State Governments.
1019,1981-82,"Under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act, 1959, excise duties are leviable m medicines and toilet preparations which contain alcohol, narcotics and narcotic drugs."
1020,1981-82,Certain changes have been proposed in the Act with a view to effecting a switch over to the metric system and also to eliminate avoidance of duty in certain cases.
1021,1981-82,"The changes proposed, however, have very little revenue significance."
1022,1981-82,I shall now turn to concessions in the area of indirect taxes.
1023,1981-82,This Government is committed to the pursuit of a vigorous policy of promoting small scale industry in the interest both of employment and broader development of 21 entrepreneurship.
1024,1981-82,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the duty exemption limit under the general scheme of excise duty concessions applicable to 72 excisable commodities from Rs 5 lakhs in terms of value of clearances to Rs 7.5 lakhs."
1025,1981-82,Clearances in excess of Rs 7.5 lakhs will continue to benefit from the existing concessional duty limited to three fourths of the applicable rates of excise duty up to a clearance of Rs 15 lakhs in a financial year as at present.
1026,1981-82,This measure should benefit a substantial number of small manufacturers and enable them to compete more effectively with large units.
1027,1981-82,I am sure that all sections of the House will welcome this enlargement of the scheme of concessions enjoyed by small scale industry.
1028,1981-82,"Under the excise duty concessions available at present to small manufacturers of some products, notably Item 68 goods and specified electronic goods, one of the criteria for eligibility is the value of investment in plant and machinery."
1029,1981-82,"I propose to increase the eligibility limit of such investment from the present figure of Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 20 lakhs, in line with the revised definition of ‘small scale units’ under the new industrial Policy."
1030,1981-82,Here again I am confident that my proposal will be welcomed by all the Hon’ble Members.
1031,1981-82,In the last Budget I had announced wide ranging duty concessions with a view to encouraging the development of the electronics industry.
1032,1981-82,"As a further step in this direction, I propose to extend the scope of the import duty concessions so as to cover 59 new items of capital equipment and 23 new items of raw materials and components used by the electronics industry."
1033,1981-82,"At present, the handloom sector of the woollen industry does not enjoy any special duty concessions."
1034,1981-82,This sector has a good growth potential.
1035,1981-82,"I, therefore, propose to reduce substantially the processing stage duty on woollen fabrics produced on handlooms on the lines of the concessions which are available to cotton fabrics produced on handlooms."
1036,1981-82,I also propose to extend the concessional import duty of 25 per cent ad valorem to a few more important drug intermediates.
1037,1981-82,This step should induce indigenous manufacturers to go in for production of more basic drugs.
1038,1981-82,"Last year, I had fully exempted cotton and cottonviscose blend hosiery from excise duty."
1039,1981-82,I now propose to extend this exemption to all hosiery articles falling under Item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff.
1040,1981-82,"Another duty concession relates to ‘flocked’ fabrics where the excise duty is being reduced from the present level of the base fabric duty plus 30 per cent ad valorem to the base fabric duty plus 15 per cent ad valorem on the consideration that the present duty burden is heavier than warranted, particularly on flockprinted fabrics."
1041,1981-82,"Further, on colour scanners for the printing industry, the basic customs duty is being reduced from 100 per cent ad valorem to 60 per cent ad valorem. 122."
1042,1981-82,"In this international Year of the Disabled, it is fitting that appropriate tax 22   relief measures should be extended to our handicapped brethern."
1043,1981-82,Artificial limbs and rehabilitation aids for the handicapped are already exempted from Central excise duty under Item 68.
1044,1981-82,I now propose to exempt fully from excise duty Braille watches for the use of the blind.
1045,1981-82,I also propose to exempt from excise duty Braille paper which is necessary for printing books for use by the blind.
1046,1981-82,I further propose to substantially reduce the customs duty on hearing aids and Braille watches imported for personal use by post or air.
1047,1981-82,"The increased levy of auxiliary duties of customs to which I have earlier referred will not be applied to goods such as orthopaedic appliances, Braille watches and parts, tricycles for the crippled, hearing aids and, parts."
1048,1981-82,I am sure that this House will wholeheartedly endorse these proposals.
1049,1981-82,The various concessions and reliefs in excise and customs duties which I have announced will entail a sacrifice of revenue of Rs 9.35 crores in a full year.
1050,1981-82,My taxation proposals will yield a sum of about Rs 35.57 crores in a full year by way of excise duties and Rs 285. 00
1051,1981-82,The concessions I have announced add up to Rs 7.05 crores on the excise side and Rs 2.30 crores on the customs side.
1052,1981-82,"The net yield is, therefore, Rs 28.52 crores from excise duties and Rs 282.70 crores from customs duties."
1053,1981-82,The accrual to the Central Exchequer in a full year will be Ra. 300.50 crores.
1054,1981-82,I hope it would not have escaped the notice of Hon’ble Members that this is perhaps the first Budget in recent years in which no increase has been effected in excise duties for raising general revenues.
1055,1981-82,"I would now like to say a few words on behalf of my Hon’ble colleague, the Minister of Communications."
1056,1981-82,A substantial programme of development of telecommunication facilities is envisaged during the Sixth Five Year Plan.
1057,1981-82,"It is, therefore, appropriate that the Department should generate internal resources to a reasonable extent for financing its Plan."
1058,1981-82,The additional dearness allowance sanctioned to employees and other increases in the cost of operations have already eroded the existing surplus of the Department.
1059,1981-82,"It has, therefore, become necessary to revise certain telecommunication tariffs."
1060,1981-82,At present the rate of telephone call charge in measured rate telephone system is 30 paise per call unit for calls exceeding 250 but not more than 1750 in a quarter.
1061,1981-82,It is proposed to increase this charge to 40 paise per call unit.
1062,1981-82,The manual trunk can charges for calls of ordinary category for a unit period of 3 minutes in the distance slabs of 100 to 200 kilometres are being increased from Rs 6 to Rs 8 and in the distance slab of 200 to 500 kilometres from Rs 10 to Ra.12.
1063,1981-82,These measures are estimated to yield Rs 35.78 crores in a full year.
1064,1981-82,The additional revenue during 1981 82 will be of the order of Rs 20 crores and has been taken into account in estimating the receipts of Posts and Telegraphs.
1065,1981-82,It is also proposed to increase the 23 rates of deposits for telephone connections under ‘Own Your Telephone’ system.
1066,1981-82,This revision will yield about Rs 5 crores to the Government by way of additional deposits in 198182.
1067,1981-82,The details of these revisions are shown in a memorandum which is being circulated along with the Budget papers.
1068,1981-82,The changes will be given effect to from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed by Parliament.
1069,1981-82,There will be no change in either postal or telegraph rates.
1070,1981-82,I had earlier stated that the resources gap estimated at existing rates of taxation is Rs 1810 crores.
1071,1981-82,"The various tax measures I have presented, together with the reliefs offered, will yield net additional revenue of Rs 271 crores to the Centre."
1072,1981-82,This leaves an uncovered deficit of Rs 1539 crores.
1073,1981-82,"This deficit may appear large, but taking a total view of the economic situation I believe it is within the limits of fiscal prudence."
1074,1981-82,The inflationary potential of the Budget must be viewed in the context of the full package of policy measures which I have outlined.
1075,1981-82,This package contains many incentives for higher production and increased utilisation of capacity.
1076,1981-82,"This should stimulate a considerable supply response during the coming year and as I have mentioned, signs of this upturn are already evident."
1077,1981-82,I attach great importance to expanded supplies as the critical element in keeping inflationary pressures in check.
1078,1981-82,The package also contains important incentives to savings which will undoubtedly help in this regard.
1079,1981-82,"Furthermore, monetary and credit policies will be so designed as to ensure that Government recourse to deficit financing takes place within a balanced and measured overall expansion of credit in the system."
1080,1981-82,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the economic situation remains difficult and yet full of great opportunities for development and growth."
1081,1981-82,I have tried to present a Budget which gives maximum support to forces that can move us forward on the path of growth with stability and social justice.
1082,1981-82,It sets the stage for all of us to work towards the achievement of our economic and social goals so clearly laid out in the Sixth Plan.
1083,1981-82,Economic policy can only do this much.
1084,1981-82,"Hard work, discipline and the innate good sense of the people of this ancient land must do the rest."
1085,1981-82,Sir I commend this Budget to the House.
1086,1982-83,"The Economic Survey for 198182, placed before the House a few days ago, gives a detailed review of the current trends in the economy."
1087,1982-83,"I shall, therefore, touch upon only a few important aspects of the economic situation which have influenced the formulation of this year’s Budget."
1088,1982-83,"As the House is aware, when the present Government came into office a little over two years ago, the country was faced with a serious and deteriorating economic situation."
1089,1982-83,"Gross National Product had declined by as much as 4.8 per cent in 197980, the infrastructure was in shambles, and prices had increased at an annual rate of 23.3 per cent by the end of January, 1980."
1090,1982-83,"It was against this background that, while presenting the regular Budget for 198081, my distinguished predecessor had informed the House that an important task before the Government was to arrest the deterioration in the economic situation and to set the economy on the path of stability and growth."
1091,1982-83,I am glad to say that we have gone a long way in achieving these objectives.
1092,1982-83,"Our Gross National Product in real terms increased by 7.5 per cent in 198081, and is expected to grow further by 4.5 per cent in 198182."
1093,1982-83,The infrastructure is functioning well inflation is being controlled.
1094,1982-83,Production of foodgrains is likely to reach a new peak this year.
1095,1982-83,The industrial sector will record a growth of 8 per cent.
1096,1982-83,The fight against inflation has been a high priority of the Government.
1097,1982-83,Any slackening of effort on this front would have undermined the very basis of our development.
1098,1982-83,"Inflation hurts all sections of the community, but it hurts the weaker and poorer sections the most."
1099,1982-83,"Inflation also hurts the development process as investment costs get distorted, and financing becomes an increasingly severe problem."
1100,1982-83,"It is, therefore, a matter of satisfaction that we have succeeded in bringing down the rate of inflation substantially."
1101,1982-83,"At the end of January, 1982, the annual rate of inflation on a pointto point basis was only 4.9 per cent as against 15.9 per cent at the end of January, 1981 and 23.3 per cent at the end of January."
1102,1982-83,"The deceleration in the wholesale prices has occurred in a wide range of commodities, and is being gradually reflected in the consumer price index."
1103,1982-83,"However, the price situation requires constant vigilance, and there can be no room for complacency."
1104,1982-83,The international price situation continues to be uncertain.
1105,1982-83,"At home, a drought or the failure of a major crop may well upset the demand and supply balance."
1106,1982-83,We must continue our efforts to increase the supplies of agricultural and industrial commodities and also restrain the growth of aggregate demand.
1107,1982-83,"At the same time, we must ensure that antisocial elements do not disrupt supplies and the distribution network."
1108,1982-83,"As I mentioned before, foodgrains production is likely to reach a new peak in the current year."
1109,1982-83,"The kharif foodgrains production is estimated at around 80 million tonnes as against 77.4 million tonnes in 198081, and the prospects of rabi crop are good."
1110,1982-83,Sugarcane production is likely to increase substantially and sugar production should reach a record level of over 67 lakh tonnes.
1111,1982-83,Groundnut production may be 20 to 25 per cent higher than in the last year.
1112,1982-83,Significant increases are also expected in cotton and jute.
1113,1982-83,"The sustained good performance in agriculture is testimony to the hard work of our farmers, agricultural scientists, and extension workers."
1114,1982-83,"It also underscores the basic soundness of our agricultural strategy, which has emphasised creation of Irrigation potential, greater fertiliser use, spread of highyielding varieties of seeds, and remunerative price support policies."
1115,1982-83,"Industrial production, which had declined by 1.4 per cent in 197980, recorded an increase of 4 per cent in 198081."
1116,1982-83,"In 198182, the growth rate will be twice as high."
1117,1982-83,"A large number of industries such as petroleum and petroleum products, fertilisers, steel, cement, vanaspati, sugar, newsprint, caustic soda, wagons and commercial vehicles, are expected to achieve new peak levels of production during the year."
1118,1982-83,The increase in industrial production has been sustained by the concerted action taken by the Government to improve the performance of infrastructure sectors.
1119,1982-83,"In the current financial year, upto January, power generation has increased by 11.3 per cent."
1120,1982-83,"Coal production in the last two years has increased by over 17 million tonnes, and the target of 121 million tonnes for 198182 is likely to be exceeded."
1121,1982-83,In railways the previous record in freight loading will be surpassed and the revenue earning traffic is expected to go up to 165 billion tonne kilometres.
1122,1982-83,"This has been made possible by improvement in operational efficiency as evidenced, for example, by the significant reduction in the wagon turnround time during the year."
1123,1982-83,"Monetary and credit policies during the year continued to emphasise the requirements of meeting the credit needs for higher production, particularly in the priority sectors, while restraining the growth of aggregate demand."
1124,1982-83,"In order to restrain the growth of liquidity in the system, the cash reserve ratio was increased in phases from 6 to 8 per cent, and the statutory liquidity ratio was raised from 34 to 35 per cent."
1125,1982-83,The Bank Rate was increased from 9 to 10 per cent and refinancing rates of the RBI were also raised.
1126,1982-83,"Even so, the growth of bank credit to the commercial sector during 2 the year 198182 is likely to be of the order of 19 per cent which should be adequate to meet the legitimate credit requirements of productive sectors."
1127,1982-83,"Hon’ble Members will be happy to note that the operation of our public sector banks has been further oriented towards extending banking facilities to under banked rural and semiurban areas, and enlarging the flow of credit to priority sectors particularly the weaker sections of society."
1128,1982-83,"During JanuaryNovember, 1981, 2517 new branches were opened by commercial banks of which 2269 were in rural and semiurban areas."
1129,1982-83,"During 1981, 22 regional rural banks were added to 85 such banks as at the end of 1980."
1130,1982-83,The priority sectors now account for about 36 per cent of the aggregate bank credit as compared to about 33 per cent in 1979.
1131,1982-83,"The target to be achieved by March, 1985 is 40 per cent."
1132,1982-83,The differential rate of interest scheme has been effectively implemented and the target of 1 per cent of aggregate credit for this scheme is being achieved by public sector banks.
1133,1982-83,The National Bank for Agricultural and Rural Development is expected to start functioning within the next few months.
1134,1982-83,"I am also pleased to inform the House that the Export Import Bank of India has been established with effect from 1st January, 1982."
1135,1982-83,I would now like to refer to the balance of payments situation.
1136,1982-83,"As the House is aware, there has been a substantial deterioration in our balance of payments since 197980 primarily because of sharp increases in import prices, particularly of oil and oil products."
1137,1982-83,"Anticipating these developments, the Government made timely arrangements to negotiate a line of credit for SDR 5 billion from the International Monetary Fund under its Extended Fund Facility."
1138,1982-83,This was necessary to avoid the disruption of our economy for want of essential imports and to gain time for readjustment to the new situation.
1139,1982-83,This line of credit has been accepted in order to support an adjustment programme drawn from our strategy of planned development.
1140,1982-83,It will help us to implement our own policies which have been sanctioned and approved by our people and Parliament.
1141,1982-83,"The main elements of the Government’s strategy for restoring the viability of our balance of payments in the coming years are: first and foremost, an increase in the domestic production of petroleum and petroleum products, fertilisers, steel, edible oils and nonferrous metals."
1142,1982-83,These account for nearly 60 per cent of our total imports.
1143,1982-83,The Government has taken necessary action to step up production and investment in these and other critical areas.
1144,1982-83,We must also intensify our efforts at expanding the export base and creating conditions conducive to larger exports.
1145,1982-83,"Exports have increased by 15.4 per cent during the first 8 months of the financial year, which is encouraging."
1146,1982-83,"However, in several areas, particularly in our traditional exports, such as textile fabrics, jute and tea, we are facing unfavourable world market conditions."
1147,1982-83,"While sustaining exports of these and other traditional commodities, much greater effort is now needed to expand those exports for which world markets are growing."
1148,1982-83,"In recent years, our receipts from 3 invisibles, particularly from remittances by nonresidents of Indian origin, have shown a healthy growth."
1149,1982-83,"This has been a stabilising factor in our balance of payments, and we must continue to provide adequate facilities for growth of receipts from this source."
1150,1982-83,The past two years have been years of crisis management and recovery.
1151,1982-83,It is a measure of our success that the economy is now back on the rails.
1152,1982-83,This provides us an opportunity to initiate further efforts for moving the economy forward and to achieve the necessary medium term adjustment.
1153,1982-83,"The objective of policy in 198283 will be to maintain, the momentum of growth and to make an all out effort to achieve the social and economic objectives of the Sixth Plan."
1154,1982-83,"This would call for larger investments, and a relentless pursuit of goals of higher productivity, efficiency and reduction in disparities."
1155,1982-83,This is the message of the revised 20Point Programme.
1156,1982-83,The Programme identifies the areas of special thrust in which there must be no compromise on performance.
1157,1982-83,The tasks that lie ahead are not easy.
1158,1982-83,Hon’ble Members are well aware of the evolving geopolitical situation in our region and the difficult environment in which we are functioning.
1159,1982-83,"While we strive to resolve the situation in a spirit of goodwill, we have to take all necessary steps to safeguard the security of the nation."
1160,1982-83,"This burden, which is not of our seeking, will involve sacrifices on the part of our people."
1161,1982-83,"In the international economic sphere, there is a rising trend towards protectionism which inhibits access to markets abroad."
1162,1982-83,"The environment for economic cooperation has also deteriorated, and the flow of concessional resources is likely to be less than envisaged earlier."
1163,1982-83,"In concert with other developing countries, we must continue to press for reforms in the international economic order and to reverse these disquieting trends."
1164,1982-83,"However, prudent management of the economy requires that due account is taken of the present international situation in devising our economic policies."
1165,1982-83,The investment requirements of the economy are large and brook no delay.
1166,1982-83,It is essential that we now make a determined effort to mobilise more resources for investment.
1167,1982-83,Maintenance of a noninflationary environment requires that additional resource mobilisation represents real savings in the economy.
1168,1982-83,"However, adequate resources for further investment in new capacities will not be forthcoming unless we also take action to utilise the existing capacities fully."
1169,1982-83,I am sure that this House will share my hope that all sections of the community would do their utmost to make this Year of Productivity a success.
1170,1982-83,"On its part, the Government would endeavour to provide due encouragement to promote this objective."
1171,1982-83,Mobilisation of resources in a noninflationary way must be a multi pronged effort.
1172,1982-83,It is necessary to make appropriate adjustments in taxation and to ensure better tax collection.
1173,1982-83,The pernicious growth of black money in the economy has been a major source of concern to the Government and Parliament.
1174,1982-83,Various economic offences have seriously eroded our development efforts.
1175,1982-83,"In the past, we took a series of measures to fight against this menace."
1176,1982-83,"Unfortunately, this thrust was 4 diluted during the period when we were out of office."
1177,1982-83,I can assure the Hon’ble Members that our commitment to eradicate all economic offences is firm and uncompromising.
1178,1982-83,I am taking steps to ensure that the provisions of law are applied vigorously and effectively to combat economic offences.
1179,1982-83,We must also continue to adjust administered prices in line with economic costs.
1180,1982-83,Uneconomic pricing policies in the public sector and in high priority industries result in erosion of resources for further investment and lead to malpractices by unscrupulous traders.
1181,1982-83,"Price adjustments carried out in the last two years have amply demonstrated the important role of appropriate pricing policies in ensuring viable operations, generating additional resources and reducing the scope for generation of black money."
1182,1982-83,One of the strengths of our economy is the fairly high rate of savings.
1183,1982-83,Most of these savings occur in the household sector.
1184,1982-83,We need to ensure that savers have an adequate incentive to hold their savings in financial instruments.
1185,1982-83,This could play a significant role in providing more resources for investment.
1186,1982-83,"Over the past two years, several steps have been taken in this direction."
1187,1982-83,"In order to mobilise private savings for public use, the Government has decided to issue two new savings instruments."
1188,1982-83,The first is a Social Security Certificate which has been specially designed for the small savers.
1189,1982-83,"Under this scheme, an individual between the age of 18 and 45 can invest up to Rs 5000, which will triple in 10 years."
1190,1982-83,The certificate will also provide social security to his family.
1191,1982-83,"In the case of the investor’s demise, his nominee or legal heir will become immediately entitled to the full maturity value of the certificate."
1192,1982-83,The details of the scheme will be announced separately.
1193,1982-83,"I trust that this National Savings instrument will prove particularly attractive to large numbers in rural areas, and persons of small means everywhere."
1194,1982-83,The second instrument is the Capital Investment Bond which is designed to attract a larger flow of private savings for public sector investment.
1195,1982-83,"These bonds will have a maturity of ten years and carry an interest rate of 7 per cent, free of incometax."
1196,1982-83,"They will also be exempt from wealth tax, and upto Rs 10 lakhs in the case of their first holder, from gift tax."
1197,1982-83,Purchasers will have to duly account for these investments.
1198,1982-83,The rate of savings that we have been able to achieve is a tribute to the habits of thrift and good sense of our people.
1199,1982-83,I have no doubt that they will take full advantage of the new opportunities and incentives that are being given to promote savings.
1200,1982-83,Remittances are an important source of foreign exchange for the country.
1201,1982-83,They are also a manifestation of the close cultural and family ties that exist between the people of this country and the people of Indian origin abroad.
1202,1982-83,"In order to further 5 encourage the flow of funds from this source, it has been decided to improve the facilities available to nonresidents."
1203,1982-83,"Any investment, without repatriation rights, made by nonresidents of Indian origin, so long as it is not for transactions in commercial property and land, will be treated on the same footing as investments of resident Indian nationals."
1204,1982-83,"They will be allowed to invest, with repatriation rights, in any new or existing company up to 40 per cent of the capital issued by such company."
1205,1982-83,They can now purchase shares of companies quoted on the stock exchanges subject to specified limits.
1206,1982-83,The interest rates on new deposits of maturities of one year and above held in nonresident external accounts will carry interest of 2 per cent above the rates permissible on local deposits of comparable maturities.
1207,1982-83,Gifts made in India out of deposits in these external accounts will be free from gift tax.
1208,1982-83,"The nonresidents can also invest in the 12 per cent 6year national savings certificates which, for them, will be free from wealth, income and gift taxes."
1209,1982-83,"Facilities for investment in nonresident external accounts and in Indian companies will be extended to companies, partnership firms, trusts, societies and other corporate bodies owned, to the extent of at least 60 per cent, by nonresidents of Indian origin."
1210,1982-83,I shall now turn to the Revised estimates for 198182 and the Budget estimates for 198283.
1211,1982-83,REVISED ESTIMATES FOR 198182 29.
1212,1982-83,I am happy to inform the House that there has been an all round improvement in revenue receipts during 198182.
1213,1982-83,"It is gratifying that despite significant tax concessions given in 198182 Budget, the receipts from incometax are likely to be Rs 1,520 crores as against the Budget estimates of Rs 1,444 crores."
1214,1982-83,"Similarly, the receipts from corporation tax are likely to go up from Rs 1,690 crores in Budget estimates to Rs 1,962 crores in the Revised estimates."
1215,1982-83,This increase is due to higher profits accruing to Oil and Natural Gas Commission and Oil India following the increase in the prices of crude effected last July.
1216,1982-83,"The receipts from customs duties are also expected to go up from the Budget estimates of Rs 3,833 crores to Rs 4,140 crores in the Revised estimates."
1217,1982-83,"As regards Union excise duties, the House will be happy to note that they are expected to go up from Rs 7,117 crores to Rs 7,501 crores i.e. Rs 384 crores more."
1218,1982-83,This is clearly indicative of the marked growth in industrial production in the current year.
1219,1982-83,"The gross tax revenues are now estimated to be Rs 15,754 crores compared with Rs 14,668 crores in the Budget estimates."
1220,1982-83,"After deducting the States’ share of various taxes, net tax revenue of the Centre is estimated to be Rs 943 crores more than the Budget estimate of Rs 10,537 crores."
1221,1982-83,"Nontax revenues and capital receipts are also estimated to show an improvement of Rs 579 crores over the Budget estimate of Rs 12,795 crores."
1222,1982-83,"Market borrowings and small savings collections would be higher by Rs 100 crores and Rs 50 6 crores, respectively."
1223,1982-83,The receipt from Special Bearer Bonds amounted to Rs 875 crores in the current year against the Budget estimate of R9.800 crores.
1224,1982-83,"In addition to these receipts, there would be an increase of Rs 200 crores in the recoveries of ways and means advances from State Governments, and of Rs 117 crores in recoveries of technical credits under rupee trade agreements."
1225,1982-83,"On the expenditure side, total budget support for the Plan is estimated to go up to Rs 10,394 crores as against Budget estimates of Rs 9,771 crores."
1226,1982-83,"The Central assistance for State and Union Territory Plans, including the programmes of Rural Electrification Corporation, is being stepped up by Rs 156 crores."
1227,1982-83,A large part of this increase is on account of higher advance Plan assistance to those States which have suffered from drought.
1228,1982-83,"In the Central Plan, outlays for railways and coal have been increased by Rs 157 crores and Rs 105 crores respectively."
1229,1982-83,"Considering the growing pace of disbursements of Agricultural Refinance and Development Corporation, Industrial Development Bank of India and other financial institutions, additional Plan support of Rs 389 crores is being provided to them in the current year."
1230,1982-83,"In view of the erosion in the internal resources of the Posts and Telegraphs Department, a higher budgetary support of Rs 173 crores is being provided."
1231,1982-83,"On the other hand, shortfalls are anticipated in Plan expenditure in certain other sectors."
1232,1982-83,"On the whole, the budgetary support for the Central Plan is estimated to go up by Rs 467 crores in the Revised estimates."
1233,1982-83,"The Budget estimates provided for nonPlan expenditure of Rs 15,100 crores."
1234,1982-83,This expenditure will also be higher in the current year due to several reasons.
1235,1982-83,"The provision for defence expenditure is being increased from Rs 4,200 crores to Rs 4,600 crores."
1236,1982-83,"Similarly, the provision for nonPlan loans to State Governments is being increased from Rs 1,296 crores to Rs 1,591 crores."
1237,1982-83,"This is mainly due to larger share of States out of collections from national small savings, and higher ways and means advances which, of course, are being recovered during the course of the year itself."
1238,1982-83,"The provision for food subsidy is being increased from Rs 650 crores to Rs 700 crores, subsidy on controlled and handloom cloth from Rs 106 crores to Rs 172 crores and the provision for cash compensatory support and market development for exports from Rs 390 crores to Rs 477 crores."
1239,1982-83,Provision for technical credits under rupee trade agreements has also to be increased from Rs 50 crores to Rs 175 crores.
1240,1982-83,A provision of Rs 91 crores has been made in the Revised estimates for contributing India’s share to the increased capital of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
1241,1982-83,"Taking these and other variations into account, nonPlan expenditure in the Revised estimates is placed at Rs 16,160 crores."
1242,1982-83,"The total expenditure is estimated to be Rs 26,554 crores in the Revised estimates compared with Rs 24,871 crores in the Budget estimates."
1243,1982-83,"As against this, the, total receipts are now estimated at Rs 24,854 crores compared with Budget estimate 7 of Rs 23,332 crores."
1244,1982-83,"Thus, the current year is expected to close with a deficit of Rs 1,700 crores, against the Budget estimate of Rs 1,539 crores."
1245,1982-83,The Budget estimates for 198283 would show that I have given the highest priority to increasing the Plan outlay.
1246,1982-83,The improvement in the economic situation in the last two years gives us an opportunity to make a major thrust towards achieving the goals of the Sixth Plan.
1247,1982-83,"I am providing for an outlay of Rs 11,000 crores for the Central Plan in 198283."
1248,1982-83,"In making sectoral allocations, I have tried to emphasise the programmes for the uplift of the poor as enumerated in’ our 20Point Programme as wall as the investment needs of the infrastructure sectors."
1249,1982-83,"The next year’s Central Plan represents an increase of 27.6 per cent over the Plan outlay of Rs 8,619 crores in the 198182 Budget estimates."
1250,1982-83,"This Hon’ble Members will no doubt appreciate, is a very large increase considering, particularly, the commitments needed for safeguarding national security."
1251,1982-83,"The Central Plan will be financed by a budgetary support of Rs 7,343 crores and Internal and extrabudgetary resources of Rs 3,657 crores."
1252,1982-83,The internal and extrabudgetary resources of public sector enterprises would thus account for 33.2 per cent of the Plan outlay as against 26.8 per cent in the previous year.
1253,1982-83,"The total of Plan outlays for 198283 of the States and Union Territories, including a provisional outlay for West Bengal, is placed at Rs 10,137 crores."
1254,1982-83,"This represents an increase of 14.4 per cent over the outlay of Rs 8,860 crores in 198182."
1255,1982-83,"Central assistance for the Plan of the States and the Union Territories will be Rs 4,002 crores compared with Rs 3,462 crores in Budget estimates for 198182."
1256,1982-83,"Taken together, the Plan outlays of the Centre, States and the Union Territories for 1982 83 will be Rs 21,137 crores, an increase of 21 per cent, over Rs 17,479 crores in 198182."
1257,1982-83,"In line with the Sixth Plan strategy, substantial increases in outlays are envisaged in crucial sectors of the economy."
1258,1982-83,"In respect of crude petroleum, there has already been a substantial expansion of output in the current year."
1259,1982-83,"With a view to sustaining the tempo of increased production, the outlay for this sector, including refineries and petrochemicals, has been fixed at Rs 2.045 crores for 1982 83, which represents an increase of 90 per cent over the current year."
1260,1982-83,"The outlay for coal is being increased to Rs 877 crores as against Rs 578 crores in 198182, an increase of 52 per cent."
1261,1982-83,"In the power sector, the outlay in the Central Plan is Rs 929 crores compared with Rs 721 crores in 198182."
1262,1982-83,"Taken together, the outlay for the energy sector, is 62 per cent higher than the current year, and constitutes 34 per cent of the Central Plan outlay."
1263,1982-83,The new Central power projects include installation of additional capacity of 1000 MW each at the Korba and Ramagundam superthermal power stations. .
1264,1982-83,"The total outlay for the power sector in the State and Central Plans taken together is 8 Rs 3,977 crores compared with Rs 3,326 crores in 198182."
1265,1982-83,Additional generating capacity of 3500 MW is expected to be commissioned during 198283.
1266,1982-83,"The revised 20Point Porgramme cans for intensified effort in a number of areas, which are vital for the development of the economy and for the welfare of our people, especially the weaker sections of the society."
1267,1982-83,Effective implementation of this programme will be a step forward towards the realisation of our goal of social justice.
1268,1982-83,This will call for concerted effort at all levels.
1269,1982-83,"In 198283, higher outlays have been provided for several areas emphasised in the 20Point Programme:  a provision of Rs 2.133 crores has been made for irrigation and Command Area Development in the Central and State Plans as against a provision of Rs 1,830 crores in 198182;  the outlay for agriculture in the Central and State Plans has been raised to Rs 1,202 crores from Rs 1,047 crores in 198182, including provisions for pulses, oilseeds and dry land farming;  a provision of Rs 190 crores has been made for the Integrated Rural Development Programme in the Central sector compared with Rs 145 crores in 1981 82, an increase of 31 per cent."
1270,1982-83,This would be matched by an equivalent provision by the States.
1271,1982-83,Each block will receive Rs 8 lakhs compared with Rs 6 lakhs in 1981 82.
1272,1982-83,With this provision more than three million rural families are expected to be assisted in 198283;  the provision in the Central Plan for the National Rural Employment Programme is also being increased to Rs 190 crores.
1273,1982-83,This amount too is to be matched by an equal provision by the States.

1275,1982-83,"This will be supplemented by a Central Investment of Rs 13.5 crores in the Scheduled Castes Development Corporations, with a contribution of the same order by the States."
1276,1982-83,The Tribal SubPlan will also have a higher outlay of Rs 95 crores in 198283;  the outlay for the Centrally sponsored Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme is being increased to Rs 127.5 crores to supplement the State Plan outlay of Rs 273 crores.

1305,1982-83,The successful launching of satellites in 1981 bears testimony to the dramatic strides made by our country in space technology.
1306,1982-83,"As part of the space programme, the APPLE space craft was launched in June, 1981."
1307,1982-83,"This is being utilised for various experiments, such as national Television and Radio hookup, digital communication."
1308,1982-83,A major objective of the Government is to harness science and technology to bring about social and economic change.
1309,1982-83,An outlay of Rs 184 crores has been provided for the Science and Technology sector in the Central Plan for 198283.
1310,1982-83,The Government attaches special importance to renewable energy sources.
1311,1982-83,"The Commission for Additional Sources of Energy has initiated several important R & D and demonstration projects in the areas of solar thermal, photovoltaic, wind, biomass and integrated energy systems."

1316,1982-83,"While I have tried to contain nonPlan expenditure for the next year, certain increases have been unavoidable."
1317,1982-83,"Defence expenditure is estimated at Rs 5,100 crores as against Rs 4,600 crores in the Revised estimates for the current year."
1318,1982-83,"Hon’ble Members will, I am sure, agree with me that in view of the uncertain external environment, the requirements of national defence should be fully met."

1320,1982-83,"Due to increase in Internal and external debt, which is utilised for funding development programmes, the provision for interest will go up from Rs 3,200 crores in the Revised estimates to Ps.3,800 crores in 198283."

1323,1982-83,I am also providing a lump sum of Rs 350 crores in 198283 for payment of additional instalments of dearness allowance and pension relief to Central Government employees.
1324,1982-83,The Government has received representations from pensioners that they should be given some relief in view of the rise in prices.
1325,1982-83,"In the Budget last year, my distinguished predecessor had announced some benefits to pensioners."
1326,1982-83,I now propose to give further relief especially at the lower levels of pension.
1327,1982-83,The minimum amount of pension plus relief will be increased to Rs 150 per month.
1328,1982-83,The minimum amount of family pension plus relief will also be increased to Rs 140 per month.
1329,1982-83,"These measures will benefit about 7 lakh low paid pensioners, and 2 lakh family pensioners."
1330,1982-83,I would like to add that about 85 per cent of the former category are retired Defence personnel.
1331,1982-83,The House will agree with me that those who have devoted the best years of their lives to the defence of the country are deserving of whatever support we can give them.
1332,1982-83,"The total nonPlan expenditure for 198283 is estimated at Rs 17,874 crores as against Rs 16,160 crores in the Revised estimates for 198182."
1333,1982-83,"As regards receipts in 198283, the gross tax revenues at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 17,614 crores compared with Rs 15,754 crores in the Revised estimates."
1334,1982-83,"The States’ share of taxes in 198283 is estimated at Rs 4,716 crores compared with Rs 4,274 crores in the current year."
1335,1982-83,"The Centre’s net tax revenue will, therefore, be Re.12,898 crores as against Rs 11,480 crores in the current year."
1336,1982-83,"The receipts from market loans are estimated at Rs 3,200 crores compared with Rs 2,900 crores in 198182."
1337,1982-83,"Small savings are estimated to yield Rs 1,400 crores as against Rs 1,300 crores in the Revised estimates."
1338,1982-83,"External assistance, net of loan repayments, is estimated at Rs 1,669 crores as against Rs 1,381 crores in 198182."
1339,1982-83,"Taking into account these and other improvements in nontax revenues and capital receipts, as well as the effect of changes in fare and freight rates of the 12 Railways, and in the Posts and Telegraphs tariff to which I shall refer a little later, the total receipts for 198283 are estimated at Rs 27,134 crores."
1340,1982-83,"The total expenditure is placed at Rs 29,219 crores."
1341,1982-83,"The overall budgetary gap at the existing rates of taxation will thus be Rs 2,085 crores."
1342,1982-83,"Sir, before I present my tax proposals, I would like to indicate the broad objectives I have kept in view."
1343,1982-83,"While we take comfort in our success in reducing inflation, it is of the utmost importance that the Budget itself should not give rise to further inflationary expectations."
1344,1982-83,Any large uncovered deficit beyond prudent limits is inherently inflationary.
1345,1982-83,It also gives rise to adverse expectations with regard to the behaviour of prices.
1346,1982-83,It is therefore my major concern to keep the budgetary deficit as low as feasible.
1347,1982-83,Another important objective is to avoid measures which would place undue burdens on the low income and middle income groups.
1348,1982-83,These groups are the worst sufferers in times of inflation.
1349,1982-83,"As I have already indicated, providing adequate incentives for increasing production and savings in the economy is a prime objective of this Budget."
1350,1982-83,Larger savings and increases in productivity can significantly help moderate inflationary pressures and also generate resources for development.
1351,1982-83,The buoyancy in revenue and the decline in the rate of inflation in the environment of strong agricultural and industrial growth in 198182 confirm this.
1352,1982-83,"Sir, coming now to direct taxes, my first proposal concerns salaried taxpayers."
1353,1982-83,"There have been many representations that the incometax exemption limit should be raised, taking account of increases in the cost of living."
1354,1982-83,"I cannot accept, as a principle."
1355,1982-83,"Nevertheless, I believe some relief to salaried taxpayers within the lowest taxable slab would be appropriate."
1356,1982-83,"At present, salaried taxpayers are entitled to a standard deduction equal to 20 per cent of the salary, subject to a ceiling of Rs 5,000."
1357,1982-83,"I propose to raise the rate of deduction from 20 per cent to 25 per cent, without disturbing the ceiling of Rs 5,000."
1358,1982-83,This will give a significant measure of relief to those with salaries upto
1359,1982-83,The loss of revenue would be Rs 21.58 crores in 198283.
1360,1982-83,"Another measure of relief seems deserved, for those at the end of their working lives."
1361,1982-83,"I propose to exempt from incometax, subject to certain conditions, the encashment benefit in lieu of unavailed earned leave given to employees when they retire."
1362,1982-83,Taxpayers who are not in receipt of house rent allowance are entitled to a deduction upto Rs 300 per month in respect of the house rent paid by them.
1363,1982-83,"However, persons receiving house rent allowance are entitled to an exemption up to Rs 400 per 13 month in respect of the house rent allowance received by them."
1364,1982-83,I propose to raise the monetary ceiling from Rs 300 to Rs 400 per month also for those who are not receiving house rent allowance.
1365,1982-83,"The owner of a selfoccupied house is entitled to a deduction, from the annual letting value of the House, of an amount equal to onehalf of the annual letting value or Rs 1,800 whichever is less."
1366,1982-83,"I propose to raise the monetary ceiling of Rs 1,800 to Rs 3,600."
1367,1982-83,"The annual letting value of a newly constructed house let out m rent is reduced for tax purposes by an amount up to Rs 2,400 in respect of each residential unit for a period of five years."
1368,1982-83,"With a view to providing a stimulus for construction of houses, particularly for persons with relatively lower incomes, I propose to raise the monetary limit of Rs 2,400 to Rs 3,600."
1369,1982-83,"I propose to liberalise the scheme of deduction in respect of longterm savings such as life insurance, provident fund contributions, etc."
1370,1982-83,"A deduction of 100 per cent will be allowed in respect of the first Rs 6.000 of the qualifying savings, plus 50 per rent of the next Rs 6,000 of such savings plus 40 per cent of the balance."
1371,1982-83,"The monetary ceiling in respect of the savings qualifying for deduction is also being raised from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000."
1372,1982-83,"The higher monetary ceiling in respect of the qualifying savings in the case of authors, playwrights, artists, musicians, actors, sportsmen and atheletes, is also being raised from Rs 50.000 to Rs 60,000."
1373,1982-83,These incentives for larger savings will result in a revenue loss of Rs 26.17 crores in a full year and Rs 19.76 crores in 198283.
1374,1982-83,It may be desirable in due course to provide a wider choice of eligible modes of savings to taxpayers.
1375,1982-83,I therefore propose to extend the existing tax concession in relation to investment in notified Central Government securities.
1376,1982-83,"I find that out of the new life insurance policies issued by the Life Insurance Corporation of India, nearly 15 per cent policies lapse before the end of the following year."
1377,1982-83,Such a high volume of lapses shortly after the issue of the policies is a matter of concern.
1378,1982-83,"It also implies that the very purpose for which the tax concession is allowed in respect of premia on such policies, which is to promote longterm savings through life insurance, is frustrated."
1379,1982-83,"I propose, therefore, to provide that where a taxpayer discontinues a life insurance policy before premia for two years have been paid, no deduction will be allowed in respect of the premia in any paid under the policy and, if such deduction has been allowed, the same shall be withdrawn."
1380,1982-83,"Under the existing incentives for stimulating savings and investment, income up to Rs 3, 000 from investment in specified financial assets, such as Government securities, units in the Unit Trust of India, bank deposits and shares in Indian companies, is exempt from incometax."
1381,1982-83,"In addition, income up to Rs 2,000 from units in the Unit Trust of India is exempt from tax."
1382,1982-83,"I propose to raise the ceiling of Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 and the separate ceiling in respect of income from units, from 14 Rs 2,000 to Rs 3,000."
1383,1982-83,This measure will result in a revenue loss of Rs 12.12 crores in a full year and Rs 9.09 crores in 198283.
1384,1982-83,"As a parallel measure, I propose to raise the ceiling of the value of investments in specified financial assets exempt from wealthtax from Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 1,65,000."
1385,1982-83,"In addition, the separate exemption of Rs 25,000 provided in respect of units in the Unit Trust of India is proposed to be raised to Rs 35,000."
1386,1982-83,"The revenue loss will be Rs 1.54 crores in a full year, but there will be no loss in 198283."
1387,1982-83,"At present, taxpayers are allowed a deduction, in the computation of taxable income, of 50 per cent of amounts invested in equity shares of new industrial companies and companies engaged in providing longterm finance for construction or purchase of houses for residential purposes."
1388,1982-83,"The maximum investment in a year qualifying for this deduction is limited to Rs 10,000."
1389,1982-83,"With a view to encouraging larger investments in such companies, I propose to raise the monetary ceiling for investment to Rs 20,000. 71."
1390,1982-83,"While I have given some relief to those in the lowest taxable income range, I consider that there is scope for more progression in the tax rates for high incomes."
1391,1982-83,"I, accordingly, propose to modify the rates of personal taxation, so as to raise the rate of incometax on the slab of Rs 60,001 to Rs 70,000, from 50 per cent to 52.5 per cent, and m the slab of Rs 85,001 to Rs 1,00,000, from 55 per cent to 57.5 per cent."
1392,1982-83,This would yield Rs 3.24 crores in a full year and Rs 2.43 crores in 198283.
1393,1982-83,"Deduction of tax at source from dividends, interest on securities and other interest causes considerable inconvenience, and even hardship, to a large number of small investors whose taxable income is below the exemption limit."
1394,1982-83,"For the convenience of such persons, I propose to provide that incometax shall not be deducted at source if the recipient furnishes a declaration to the payer of such income to the effect that his estimated total income of the relevant year will be below the exemption limit."
1395,1982-83,I also propose to provide that tax will not be deducted at source from interest paid on such securities of the Central Government or a State Government as may be notified by the Central Government in this behalf.
1396,1982-83,The tests of “residence” in India laid down for taxation purposes result in hardship to Indian citizens earning income in foreign countries who come to India for short spells.
1397,1982-83,"An individual is regarded as resident in India in a year if he stays here in that year for 30 days only, and also maintains a dwelling house here for 182 days or more."
1398,1982-83,"As this test causes hardship to persons working outside India, who come home even on relatively short visits, I propose to delete this test of residence."
1399,1982-83,"Under another test, persons who have been in India for 365 days or more in the four years preceding the relevant year, become resident in that year by being in India for 60 days or more in that year."
1400,1982-83,"In the case of Indiancitizens who are employed 15 abroad and who come to India on leave or vacation, the period is 90 days."
1401,1982-83,"I propose to extend this benefit also to the selfemployed and those in other occupations, Irrespective of their avocation abroad or the nature of their visit to India."
1402,1982-83,"Indian citizens who go abroad for purposes of employment are now chargeable to tax in India on their foreign income, if they have stayed in India for more than 60 days that year."
1403,1982-83,I propose to liberalise the provision so that an Indian citizen who leaves India in any year for purposes of employment shall not be treated as resident unless he has been in India for 182 days or more in that year.
1404,1982-83,I will now come to some proposals regarding foreign exchange earnings.
1405,1982-83,I propose to provide some tax relief to exporters whose export turnover for any year exceeds that of the immediately preceding year by morethan 10 per cent.
1406,1982-83,"The tax relief, to be calculated at a specified percentage of such excess turnover, would be limited to 10 per cent of the incometax otherwise payable on export profits."
1407,1982-83,The rate at which the tax relief will be calculated and the goods qualifying for the purposes of this concession will be notified by the Central Government.
1408,1982-83,"With a view to strengthening the competitiveness of our construction contractors who have undertaken projects outside India, I propose to exempt 25 per cent of the profits derived by them from such foreign contracts, subject to certain conditions."
1409,1982-83,"With a view to augmenting the capital base of Indian banks engaged in banking operations in foreign countries, I propose to provide that those banks which are approved in this behalf by the Central Government would be entitled to a deduction upto 40 per cent of their income carried to a special reserve account."
1410,1982-83,Interesttax levied under the Interesttax Act forms integral part of our credit policy.
1411,1982-83,"However, taking note of the escalation in costs of industrial projects, I propose to exempt scheduled banks from payment of interesttax on the interest received by them on loans sanctioned in foreign currency for import of capital plant and machinery."
1412,1982-83,"With a view to improving the competitiveness of export of capital plant and machinery, I propose to exempt interest paid on credit sanctioned by scheduled banks for export of capital plant and machinery on deferred payment terms outside India."
1413,1982-83,"Investment allowance at the higher rate of 35 per cent is granted in respect of machinery and plant installed for the manufacture of articles made with knowhow developed in Government laboratories, public sector companies, recognised institutions and universities."
1414,1982-83,"This concession is available in relation to machinery and plant installed up to 31st March,1982."
1415,1982-83,I propose to extend this tax concession for a further period of five years.
1416,1982-83,Dividends received by a domestic company from an Indian company engaged exclusively or almost exclusively in the manufacture of specified articles are 16 completely exempt from income tax.
1417,1982-83,"Having regard to the importance of basic drugs, synthetic rubber and rubber chemicals including carbon black, I propose to extend the benefit of this tax concession to dividends received from companies engaged in the manufacture of these articles as well."
1418,1982-83,"At present, scheduled commercial banks are allowed a deduction in respect of provisions made by them for bad and doubtful debts relating to advances made by their rural branches."
1419,1982-83,The deduction is limited to 1.5 per cent of the aggregate average advances made by the rural branches.
1420,1982-83,"In order to promote rural banking and to assist nonscheduled commercial banks operating in the rural sector, I propose to extend the benefit of this tax concession to them also."
1421,1982-83,Energy saving and protection of the environment are high priority areas.
1422,1982-83,"I therefore propose to allow depreciation at 30 per cent on devices and systems for energy saving, or for minimising environmental pollution or for conservation of natural resources."
1423,1982-83,The list of the qualifying items will be notified in due course.
1424,1982-83,"At present, taxpayers are entitled to 100 per cent deduction in respect of donations made to approved institutions engaged in carrying out programmes of rural development."
1425,1982-83,I propose to extend this concession to donations made to approved institutions for use in programmes of conservation of natural resources.
1426,1982-83,"Hon’ble Members will be happy to hear that I propose to place donations made to the National Children’s Fund at par with donations made to other funds of national importance such as the National Defence Fund, the Jawaharlal Nehru Memorial Fund, and the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund."
1427,1982-83,I consider that some rationalisation of the taxation in respect of capital gains is desirable.
1428,1982-83,"In the case of noncorporate taxpayers, longterm capital gains up to Rs 5,000 are deducted in full."
1429,1982-83,"Of the balance amount, a deduction of 25 per cent is allowed where the gains relate to lands and buildings and of 40 per cent where the gains relate to other assets."
1430,1982-83,"I propose to modify these provisions so as to relate the deduction to the period for which the capital asset has been held by the taxpayer, and allow a larger deduction in cases where the asset has been held for a longer period."
1431,1982-83,"The aggregate deduction in respect of capital gains relating, to gold, bullion or jewellery will, however, be restricted to Rs 50,000 only."
1432,1982-83,"There is an acute shortage of housing, and house building activity has to be given impetus."
1433,1982-83,"With a view to providing an incentive to taxpayers who do not own a residential house, I propose to exempt from tax longterm capital gains arising from the transfer of other assets where the net consideration is invested by the taxpayer in a residential house."
1434,1982-83,"At present, capital gains arising from the transfer of a house used for personal residence by the taxpayer are exempt from incometax to the extent that such gains are utilised by the taxpayer for constructing or purchasing a house for purposes 17 of personal residence within a specified period."
1435,1982-83,These conditions often lead to hardship.
1436,1982-83,I therefore propose to remove these restrictive conditions.
1437,1982-83,Charitable and religious trusts are required to conform to the investment pattern laid down in the incometax Act.
1438,1982-83,Any trust which has not changed over to this pattern of investment will forfeit exemption from tax from the assessment year 1982 83.
1439,1982-83,"These trusts have been given adequate notice to change their investment pattern and, ordinarily, I would not have proposed any modification in these provisions."
1440,1982-83,"However, I find that the whole gamut of the provisions relating to charitable and religious trusts is under consideration by the Economic Administration Reforms Commission."
1441,1982-83,"As the Government would like to carefully consider the recommendations of the Commission in this matter, I propose to amend the relevant provisions so that such trusts do not forfeit exemption from incometax for the assessment year 198283."
1442,1982-83,"My distinguished predecessor had made an announcement in the Lok Sabha on the 31st March, 1981 that the provisions of the incometax Act relating to the investment pattern of trust funds would be modified, so as to permit charitable and religious trusts or institutions to invest the trust funds in immovable properties as well."
1443,1982-83,I am proposing an amendment of the relevant provisions of the incometax Act to fulfil the assurance given by him.
1444,1982-83,"While the levy of wealthtax on agricultural property was discontinued by the Finance No.2 Act, 1980, owners of tea, coffee, rubber and cardamom plantations continue to be chargeable to wealthtax."
1445,1982-83,"Our experience is that the valuation of agricultural land forming part of such plantations leads to administrative difficulties, complaints of harassment and litigation."
1446,1982-83,The yield from this levy is also insignificant.
1447,1982-83,"I, therefore, propose to discontinue the levy of wealthtax on such plantations as well."
1448,1982-83,"The value of tools and instruments necessary to enable the taxpayer to carry on his profession or vocation is exempt from wealthtax up to an aggregate amount of Rs 20,000, which appears inadequate."
1449,1982-83,"I propose to raise it to Ps.50,000."
1450,1982-83,"I also propose to raise, from the present Rs 30,000 to Rs 75,000, the ceiling of the value of conveyances, including motor cars, for the purpose of exemption from wealthtax."
1451,1982-83,"Stamp duty paid on an instrument relating to the gift of any property is allowed as a deduction from the gifttax payable by the taxpayer in cases where the amount of gifttax exceeds Rs 1,000."
1452,1982-83,"I propose to allow the benefit of this deduction even where the gifttax payable does not exceed Rs 1,000."
1453,1982-83,"The Hotelreceipts Tax Act, 1980 provides for the levy of a tax on the gross receipts of luxury hotels."
1454,1982-83,"As the levy of this tax may adversely affect the flow of foreign tourists into India, I propose to discontinue this levy in relation to the chargeable receipts of such hotels accruing or arising or received by them after the 27th February, 1982."
1455,1982-83,The revenue loss would be about Rs 6 crores.
1456,1982-83,The other proposals in the field of direct taxes are of relatively minor 18 importance.
1457,1982-83,"I would, therefore, not like to take up the time of the House by referring to them here."
1458,1982-83,"Hon’ble Members would have noted that in the direct tax proposals I have set out, I have endeavoured to preserve stability in the tax system, while providing substantial incentives for savings."
1459,1982-83,I have also rationalised the capital gains tax and provided some concessions where necessary.
1460,1982-83,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the area of indirect taxes."
1461,1982-83,"Taking customs duties first, my principal proposal is with regard to auxiliary duties of customs."
1462,1982-83,"This levy, which has been imposed on an annual basis since the 1973 Budget, is proposed to be continued during 198283."
1463,1982-83,The balance of payments position has been under pressure in recent times and will continue to be so for some time to come.
1464,1982-83,"However, a liberalised regime, of imports has been a feature of our economic policies."
1465,1982-83,"This will be continued in order that investment and production, particularly in essential and priority sectors, are not hampered or slowed down."
1466,1982-83,"There is no strong reason, however, why those who have access to imports in a difficult situation should grudge to pay a little more."
1467,1982-83,"I accordingly propose to increase the rates of auxiliary duties by 5 percentage points on all categories of imports, with some exceptions."
1468,1982-83,"I am excluding from the proposed increase in auxiliary duty essential items like crude petroleum, bulk petroleum products, such as kerosene and high speed diesel on, and some other items on which import duty rates have been adjusted in the recent past on price parity considerations."
1469,1982-83,Fuller details of these proposals are available in the Budget papers.
1470,1982-83,My proposals relating to auxiliary duties of customs are expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 290 crores.
1471,1982-83,"In the light of the present market conditions, and the need for encouraging a few selected industries, it is necessary to effect certain changes in the basic customs duties."
1472,1982-83,"I propose to raise the basic customs duty on cork and cork articles from 40 per cent to 60 per cent ad valorem; on certain categories of dyestuffs, from 60 per cent to 100 per cent ad valorem; and oiicirtain other categories of dyestuffs, pigments and colours and paints and varnishes, from 100 per cent to 150 per cent ad valorem."
1473,1982-83,"I also propose to increase the basic customs duty on certain items of iron and steel, such as melting scrap of stainless steel and heat £esisting steel, and certain categories of alloy steel excluding stainless steel and heat resisting steel, from the existing levies to 60 per cent ad valorem."
1474,1982-83,"The effective rate of basic customs duty on copper pipes and tubes, blanks and SoRlow bars of prescribed specifications will be increased from 40 per cent to 60 per cent ad valorem."
1475,1982-83,The basic customs duty on polyester chips is being increased from 100 per cent to 140 per cent.
1476,1982-83,These proposals are likely to result in additional revenue of Rs 42 crores.
1477,1982-83,"It may be recalled that in the last Budget, an effective customs duty of 15 19 per cent ad valorem was imposed on imported newsprint on which there continues to be large foreign exchange outgo."
1478,1982-83,The Government has received representations against this levy.
1479,1982-83,I propose to convert the ad valorem levy to a specific total levy of Rs 825 per metric tonne so as to obviate automatic increase in its incidence on account of rising international prices.
1480,1982-83,There will be no revenue loss.
1481,1982-83,"The indigenous.zinc and lead industries are facing difficulties owing to escalation of input costs, particularly of imported concentrates."
1482,1982-83,"In order to enable them to increase their capacity utilisation, I propose to reduce the total customs duty incidence on imported zinc concentrates from 50 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem and that on lead concentrates from 50 per cent to 5 per cent ad valorem."
1483,1982-83,"Simultaneously, I propose to increase the customs duty on imported zinc metal from 50 per cent ad valorem to 80 per cent ad valorem."
1484,1982-83,"In order partly to offset the revenue loss, I propose to increase excise duties on indigenously produced zinc metal, zinc scrap and zinc products by Rs 715 per metric tonne and that on lead metal and scrap by Rs 374 per metric tonne."
1485,1982-83,The excise duty on zinc pipes and tubes will go up from 38.5 per cent to 49.5 per cent ad valorem.
1486,1982-83,"These measures, taken together, would result in an overall loss of about Rs 41 lakhs."
1487,1982-83,"With a view to improving the competitive position of Indian chromite ore in the context of falling prices in the export market, I propose to convert the existing specific rates of export duty applicable to different grades of the ore and concentrates to an ad valorem duty of 10 per cent."
1488,1982-83,The revenue sacrifice is of the order of Rs 1 crore.
1489,1982-83,I also propose to fully exempt two fertilizers Calcium Ammonium Nitrate and Ammonium Sulphate from customs duties.
1490,1982-83,The import duty on internal combustion engines and noninterchangeable parts of such engines for manufacture of power tillers is also proposed to be reduced from 125 per cent to 50 per cent.
1491,1982-83,I propose to fully exempt 10 more bulk drugs imported for manufacture of lifesaving drugs and medicines.
1492,1982-83,"During the past few years, the Government has been using the fiscal mechanism for accelerating the growth of the electronics industry."
1493,1982-83,"As a further step in this strategy, I propose to raise the basic customs duty on electronic items such as computers, calculating machines, accounting machines, cash registers and certain electronic subassemblies from the existing levels of 40,50 and 60 per cent to 100 per cent ad valorem."
1494,1982-83,"On the other hand, I propose to extend the scope of the present import duty concessijn tocover 45 new items of capital equipment and 13 new items of raw materials and components used by the electronics industry."
1495,1982-83,The customs duties leviable on these items are proposed to be reduced from the respective existing rates to 35 per cent ad valorem in the case of machinery and instruments and to 55 per cent ad valorem in the case of raw materials and components.
1496,1982-83,The net revenue gain from these proposals is Rs 13 crores.
1497,1982-83,"Representations have been received that it is not always possible for units in the Free Trade Zones to export their entire production, and that a provision should be made to allow a proportion of the goods manufactured in these Zones to be cleared into the domestic tariff area."
1498,1982-83,"It has been decided, subject to certain conditions, to allow such removals upto 25 per cent of the production of a unit for sale or use within the country on payment of appropriate duties."
1499,1982-83,Provision is being made in the Finance Bill to amend the Chstoms and Central Excise Acts for the purpose.
1500,1982-83,"On the Central excise side, the levy of special duties of excise is proposed to be continued at the existing rates during the year 198283."
1501,1982-83,The existing exemptions from the special duty are also proposed to be continued.
1502,1982-83,"As I said earlier, my basic approach has been that additions to revenue from Central excise duties should essentially come from increased production."
1503,1982-83,I am also avoiding recourse to measures which could affect retail prices over a wide spectrum of goods.’
1504,1982-83,I have accordingly selected only a very few items for increased taxation.
1505,1982-83,"In selecting these items, I have kept in view the demand and supply situation which has resulted in undue profits to trading channels, the scope for subjecting certain articles of elite consumption to a higher rate of tax, and the need to restructure the excise and customs duties applicable to certain basic industries."
1506,1982-83,"The Government has decided to Introduce a scheme of ‘levy’ and ‘free’ sle of cement, and a dual pricing policy based on this concept."
1507,1982-83,Details of the new scheme are being notified by the Government separately.
1508,1982-83,"There has been no increase in the low level of basic excise duty on cement since January, 1977, even though thereafter the price of cement has increased very substantially."
1509,1982-83,"I propose to increase the total excise duty on ordinary portland cement, portland pozzolana cement, blast furnance slag cement and masonry cement, from Rs 71.50 to Rs 135 per metric tonne."
1510,1982-83,The more expensive special varieties of cement will be subject to higher rates of duty.
1511,1982-83,The effective total ;excise duty on cement produced in mini cement plants is proposed to be fixed at Rs 100 per tonne.
1512,1982-83,"I also propose to impose a basic customs duty of 10 per cent ad valorem on imported cement, together with full countervailing duty."
1513,1982-83,No auxiliary duty would be leviable on imported cement.
1514,1982-83,These proposals will give additional revenue of Rs 158.73 crores on the Central excise side and Rs 39.60 crores on the customs side.
1515,1982-83,The impact of the proposed increase in excise duty per bag of cement of 50 kilograms would work out to Rs 3.175.
1516,1982-83,"In the recent past, certain expensive electronic goods favoured by the affluent are being produced in increasing quantities."
1517,1982-83,These are now subjected to a very low incidence of duty at 8 per cent ad valorem under item 68 of the Central Excise Tariff.
1518,1982-83,"I now propose to carve out new entries in the Excise Tariff, and subject video cassette recorders and reproducers, television cameras and video cameras, and simililar goods to a basic exicse duty of 25 per cent ad I valorem."
1519,1982-83,"Blank and recorded video and audio tapes of the spool and cassette types, as also video cIlacs, are also 21 proposed to be subject to a basic duty of 25 per cent ad valorem."
1520,1982-83,Recordings which are not for commercial purposes will be exempt.
1521,1982-83,"I also propose to levy basic duty at a higher rate of 40 per cent on electronic machines for games of skill or chance, including those used for television games and video games."
1522,1982-83,These proposals would yield revenue of Rs 3.83 crores.
1523,1982-83,"Toilet preparations not containing alcohol are liable to Central excise duty at the basic rate of 100 per cent ad valorem whereas those containing alcohol attract duty under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparat16nsExcise Duty Act at only 60 per cent ad valorem or Rs 13.20 per litre of pure alcohol content, whichever is higher."
1524,1982-83,Some misuse because of these differential rates has come to notice.
1525,1982-83,"I, therefore, propose to raise the alternative ad valorem rate to 100 per cent ad valorem so as to place both categories of toilet reparations more or ess at par."
1526,1982-83,The revenue yield from this measure is expected to be Rs 2.3 crores and would accrue mostly to the States.
1527,1982-83,"While cotton will continue to enjoy the predominant position in textiles, it is necessary to encourage increased consumption of blends of cotton and manmade fibres and yarns, if we are to achieve the Plan target of even a modest increase in the per capita availability of cloth."
1528,1982-83,"For some time past, blended fabrics containing polyester fibre in proportions too small to impart the requisite durability and easycare properties to the fabrics are flooding the market with stampings thereon which would mislead the public."
1529,1982-83,"From the point of view of better utilisation of polyester fibre, it is necessary to encourage blends of desirable proportions and discourage blends which do not really serve the intended purpose."
1530,1982-83,I therefore propose to make certain changes in the fiscal levies applicable to manmade fibres and yarns.
1531,1982-83,I propose to increase the duty on blended cotton yarn and celluosic spun yarns containing up to on esixth by weight of polyester fibre from the existing average total incidence of Rs 1.63 per kilogram to Rs 7.5 per kilogram.
1532,1982-83,"The total incidence on such blended yarns containing more than onesixth but less than 50 per cent of polyester fibre, which seem to be desirable blends in Indian conditions, is proposed to be reduced from Rs 22.50 per kilogram to Rs 11.25 per kilogram."
1533,1982-83,"Similarly, the incidence on blends containing 50 per cent or more but less than 70 per cent of polyester fibre is being reduced from Rs 30 per kilogram to Rs 22.50 per kilogram."
1534,1982-83,There will be no change with regard to blends containing 70 per or more of polyester fibre.
1535,1982-83,It is proposed to increase the total incidence of Central excise duty on acrylic fibre from Rs 12.50 to Rs 17.50 per kilogram and simultaneously to reduce the countervailin g duty an imported fibre from Rs 37.50 to Rs 30 per kilogram.
1536,1982-83,"Turning to viscose staple fibre, the excise duty is being raised from Rs 3.125 per kilogram to Rs 4 per kilogram and the duty on polynosic: and high wet modulus fibres is being reduced from Rs 5 to Rs 4 per kilogram."
1537,1982-83,Acetate filament yarn which is used in the decentralised sector is not produced in adequate quantities in the country.
1538,1982-83,It is proposed to reduce the customs duty on it from 125 per cent to 20 per cent ad valorem so as to facilitate imports of this yarn.
1539,1982-83,"I do not propose to change the excise or basic customs duty rates applicable to other fibres such as acetate fibre and polyester fibre and other filament yarns such as viscose, nylon and polyester filament yarn."
1540,1982-83,These proposals would result in a net loss of Rs 13 crores on the Central excise side and a gain of Rs 12.94 crores on the customs side.
1541,1982-83,"At present, there is no basic excise duty leviable on manmade fabrics, the incidence of such duties having been shifted to the fibre and yarn stages."
1542,1982-83,These fabrics attract only additional excise duties in lieu of sales tax.
1543,1982-83,"While the present rate structure is progressive on fabrics having exfactory price up to Rs 10 per square metre, it is not so in respect of the higher priced fabrics since the duty applicable to them is a uniform 51 per cent ad valorem."
1544,1982-83,"There are very high priced fabrics in this range, catering to affluent consumption, and these fabrics can well bear a moderate increase in duties."
1545,1982-83,I therefore propose to introduce further progression in the rate structure in such a way that fabrics having exfactory prices of more than Rs 20 per square metre would attract duty at 71/ per cent ad valorem.
1546,1982-83,"The additional revenue proposal would also be a step towards fulfilment of the Centre’s commitment to the States to increase the overall incidence of additional excise duties in lieu of sales tax, as a percentage of the value of clearances."
1547,1982-83,I am sure that Parliament and the States would wholeheartedly welcome this step.
1548,1982-83,"The overall effect of the duty changes on blended fabrics containing cotton, cellulosics and polyester would be a decrease in the price of desirable blends and an increase in the price of other less desirable blends."
1549,1982-83,I have included in the Finance Bill some provisions designed to achieve simplification and greater clarity in the tariff nomenclature and thereby minimise the scope for classification disputes.
1550,1982-83,"These measures are not designed as revenue raising exercises, but because of the changes in classifications, some revenue will accrue."
1551,1982-83,"The proposals cover, among others, major petroleum products, artificial and synthetic resins and plastic materials."
1552,1982-83,"I also propose to rationalise and restructure the tariff relating to paper and paper boards, the primary objective being to exempt small scale paper converters from payment of excise duty and to release them from excise control."
1553,1982-83,"In order to recoup the consequent loss in revenue, I propose to raise the basic excise duty on industrial varieties of paper and paper boards by a small margin of 21/ per cent ad 2valorem."
1554,1982-83,"However, certain converted papers of high valueadded categories are 23 proposed to Sesubject to basic excise duty at 321/ per cent ad valorem."
1555,1982-83,"Similarly, 2 specified articles made of paper and paper board are proposed to be brought within the purview of the tariff item but effectively restricting the levy to printed cartons and printed boxes."
1556,1982-83,"In recent years, the scheme of input excise duty relief has been extended to cover certain specified industrial products."
1557,1982-83,"I propose to further extend input duty relief in respect of synthetic rubber, carbon black and rubber processing chemicals going into the production of tyres."
1558,1982-83,"To make up for the revenue loss, I propose to raise the duty leviable on tyres from a total of 60.5 per cent to 66 per cent ad valorem."
1559,1982-83,While tyres for tractors and scooters will also enjoy the benefits of the input duty relief.
1560,1982-83,I do not propose to increase the final duty rates them.
1561,1982-83,"As this is intended to be a balancing exercise, no credit for additional revenue is being taken."
1562,1982-83,"As the House is aware, the administered price of aluminium metal is revised periodically, keeping in view escalations in input costs."
1563,1982-83,"In order to contain the incidence of excise duty, it is proposed to levy duty at specific rates."
1564,1982-83,"The rates would be Rs 3,085 on electrolytic grade ingots, Rs 3,125 on billets, Rs 3,330 on wire rods produced by primary producers and Rs 3,280 on wire bars."
1565,1982-83,There would be no change in the rates of countervailing duties.
1566,1982-83,The proposal will give some relief to the finances of State Electricity Boards.
1567,1982-83,"As an antiavoidance measure, I propose to add to the present ad valorem levy on flat glass, a specific levy at the rate of Rs 5.50 per milimetre thickness per square metre."
1568,1982-83,Effective rates of duty are being prescribed at lower levels for different categories of flat glass.
1569,1982-83,"The Government has received a large number of representations alleging malpractices in the biri industry, on account of the present differential rates of excise duty applicable to branded and unbranded biris."
1570,1982-83,Many State Governments and Associations have urged that this distinction should be done away with.
1571,1982-83,A suggestion to the same effect has also been made in a recent meeting of Labour Ministers.
1572,1982-83,"Taking note of these points, I propose to do away with the existing duty differential and to subject both branded and unbranded biris to a uniform composite duty rate of Rs 3.60 per thousand."
1573,1982-83,"Simultaneously, the existing quantum of unbranded biris eligible for duty free clearance is also being reduced from 30 lakhs to 20 lakhs in a financial year."
1574,1982-83,"This would still leave selfemployed family units, petty shopkeepers, etc. out of the tax net."
1575,1982-83,The general scheme of excise duty concession applicable to small manufacturers of 72 specified groups of commodities is being extended to manufacturers of asbestos fibre and yarn.
1576,1982-83,Some misuse of the scheme with a view to avoiding excise duty on popular brands of aerated waters has come to notice.
1577,1982-83,I therefore propose to take aerated waters out of the scope of the general scheme and devise a new scheme for it.
1578,1982-83,"Essentially, small manufacturers who sell their products under their own brand 24 or trade names would continue to enjoy the benefits available under the present scheme."
1579,1982-83,"However, manufacturers who produce and bottle aerated waters under brand or trade names in pursuance of agreements with the owners of such brand or trade names would not be eligible for the concession."
1580,1982-83,This also is purely an antiavoidance measure.
1581,1982-83,The general scheme referred to earlier seems to have been similarly exploited by certain small manufacturers of synthetic organic dyestuffs.
1582,1982-83,"Under the present scheme, clearances up to Rs 71/ lakhs are fully exempt and an additional 2 Rs 71/ lakhs are subject to duty at 3/4ths of the duty rate applicable to the organised 2 sector."
1583,1982-83,"In view of the relatively high rate of duty en dyestuffs and the fact that techniques of production of some dyestuffs are comparatively simple, it appears there has been a proliferation of small units with consequent deleterious effects on the quality, and also on the industry as a whole and on exports."
1584,1982-83,"I, therefore, propose to delete dyestuffs from the purview of the general scheme."
1585,1982-83,"Under a new scheme which is being announced in respect of dyestuffs, very small manufacturers whose clearances do not exceed Rs 1 lakh per annum will be fully exempt from excise duty."
1586,1982-83,"In the.case of other small manufacturers, clearances upto Rs 15 lakhs of dyestuffs will be subject to 50 per cent of the duty applicable to the organised sector."
1587,1982-83,All manufacturers will be brought under excise control.
1588,1982-83,"The monetary content of the present scheme of relief is, by and large, maintained under the new scheme."
1589,1982-83,"At present, certain specified consumer electronic goods manufactured in the small sector attract duty rates lower than the normal rates."
1590,1982-83,"To restrict this duty concession to genuine small manufacturers, it is proposed to restrict the scheme of duty exemption to manufacturers with total annual turnover not exceeding Rs 2 crores."
1591,1982-83,"With regard to the match industry, I do not propose to disturb the existing duty structure."
1592,1982-83,Small manufacturers whose clearances have not exceeded 150 million matches in the preceding financial year would continue to be eligible for the concessional rate of duty of Rs 1.60 per gross boxes on clearances upto 120 million matches in the financial year.
1593,1982-83,The concession will not be available if the matches are marketed under the labels of manufacturers who pay duty at Rs 4.50 or Rs 7.20.
1594,1982-83,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, the Government has been using the excise duty mechanism as a powerful incentive for the growth of the cottage sector of the match industry."
1595,1982-83,"A number of manufacturers in the middle sector have, however, challenged in courts of law, the excise concession scheme for the cottage sector and obtained judgements in their favour."
1596,1982-83,This may result in refund of substantial amounts of duty to the middle sector units.
1597,1982-83,"As the element of duty at the higher rate would have already been passed on to the millions of consumers, any refund of such duties would only result in unjust enrichment."
1598,1982-83,A provision has been made in the Finance Bill to obviate this contingency.
1599,1982-83,"There have been some disputes in the recent past regarding the determination of assessable values of excisable goods from a given cumduty price, 25 resulting in considerable litigation."
1600,1982-83,This has resulted in locking up substantial amounts of revenue.
1601,1982-83,"It is proposed to suitably amend section 4 of the Central Excises and Salt Act to make it clear that in computing the amount of duty of excise deductible from the cumduty price, the effective amount of duty of excise payable on the goods under assessment shall alone be taken into account."
1602,1982-83,"This amendment is being given effect to, retrospectively from let October, 1975."
1603,1982-83,It has been the longstanding practice to charge excise duty on goods used for captive consumption within the factory where they are produced.
1604,1982-83,"Some doubt had, however, been cast on this position as a result of judgements of some High Courts, which interpreted certain provisions of the Central Excise Rules to hold that duty could not be collected on such goods as they had not been removed from the factory."
1605,1982-83,A number of manufacturers have also obtained stay orders from courts based on the same grounds.
1606,1982-83,The matter has been taken up in appeal.
1607,1982-83,"Nevertheless, in order to place the position beyond doubt, the relevant Central Excise Rules have been suitably amended."
1608,1982-83,A provision has also been included in the Finance Bill so that these amendments will have retrospective effect and the collections of duty made in accordance with the existing practice will also be validated.
1609,1982-83,"As the House is aware, 1982 has been designated by the Prime Minister as the “Productivity Year”."
1610,1982-83,"With the improvement in infrastructural facilities,it is hoped that industrial production would register further growth in the current year."
1611,1982-83,The fiscal meqhanism could be judiciously deployed in furthering this objective.
1612,1982-83,"With this in view, I propose to formulate a scheme of excise duty concession for increased production of goods during the period of 12 months commencing on the let March, 1982 and ending on the 28th February, 1983."
1613,1982-83,"The scheme would cover 38 tariff items including some basic raw materials, other important industrial inputs and certain finished products."
1614,1982-83,"Some of the items are caustic soda, fertilisers, synthetic resins, steel ingots and steel products."
1615,1982-83,A full list may be found in the Budget papers.
1616,1982-83,"The benefits of the scheme would accrue only in cases where the production in the 12 months period referred to above exceeds 110 per cent of the production during the base period, namely, the 12 months ending on the 28th February, 1982."
1617,1982-83,"The duty concession would be 1/5th of the total amount of duty paid on the excess production computed, as explained earlier, in respect of goods carrying basic excise duty of 20 per cent ad valorem or less, and 1/10th of the duty in other cases."
1618,1982-83,The amount so computed for the whole period would be given as a credit which may be utilised for payment of Central excise duty during the financial year 198384.
1619,1982-83,"The scheme will apply also to small scale manufacturers, who actually pay duty."
1620,1982-83,"It is proposed to ensure that those small scale units which are eligible for the benefits of the relevant excise duty concession schemes and are within the respective 26 cutoff points during the year 198182, would continue to be eligible to the said benefits in 198384, even if they produce and clear goods in excess of the eligibility limits in the Productivity Year."
1621,1982-83,I am sure that industry will rise to the occasion and respond to this generous gesture of the Government and achieve new peaks of production.
1622,1982-83,"Since the Government would also be a beneficiary of the higher production in the shape of increased collection of excise duties, I do not propose to take any amount as revenue loss on account of the proposed concession."
1623,1982-83,I have already referred to the need to minimise the impact of my proposals on the middle and poorer sections of society.
1624,1982-83,I propose to go further and give some concessions on articles of special interest to those sections.
1625,1982-83,I propose to partially or fully exempt from excise duties several articles of common consumption.
1626,1982-83,"Some of these products are of interest to the student community, some are of general utility, yet others of interest to the disabled and me in the interest of horticulture."
1627,1982-83,"I propose to fully exempt from excise duty, pencils, erasers, pens including ball point pens and refills, laboratory glassware, enamelware, thermos flasks and parts, water coolers, candles, tooth brushes, spectacles and spectacle frames, oneday alarm ‘ clocks, domestic water filters, handpumps, Braille typewriters, invalid carriages and helmets."
1628,1982-83,"Further, I propose to reduce the basic excise duty on specified fruit and vegetable preparations from 15 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem."
1629,1982-83,"I also propose to increase the present value limits of Rs 15 per pair of footwear for eligibility to full duty exemption, to Rs 30 per pair."
1630,1982-83,Lac is also being exempted.
1631,1982-83,"In order to reduce the packaging cost involved in the sale of milk in laminated paper packs, I propose to exempt from excise duty low density polyethylene film and paper to be used by the Indian Dairy Corporation for the manufacture of such paper packs."
1632,1982-83,"This measure should enable larger marketing of milk in paper packs which have a longer shelf life, and also help in the fuller utilisation of surplus milk produced in flush seasons."
1633,1982-83,"At present, mopeds of engine capacity upto 75cc beat a reduced rate of excise duty of 10 per cent ad valorem."
1634,1982-83,This fuelsaving personalised conveyance is becoming increasingly popular particularly in urban and semiurban areas.
1635,1982-83,I propose to extend the concession to mopeds of engine capacity upto 100 cc which are expected to be more fuelefficient.
1636,1982-83,I had referred earlier to certain adjustments of excise and customs duties consequent on a review of the fiscal levies on manmade fibres and yarn.
1637,1982-83,The production of blended cloth in the handloom sector is at present around 12 million metres.
1638,1982-83,"In order to enable the handloom sector to register faster growth, I propose to fully exempt from excise duties polyester blended fabrics woven on handlooms from processing stage duties, if they are processed in factories set up by State Handloom Development Corporations or Apex Cooperative Societies approved in this behalf by the Central Government."
1639,1982-83,This concessiozy involves a revenue loss of Rs 4 crores.
1640,1982-83,I 27 also propose to exempt metallised manmade filament yarn from the whole of the excise duty considering its use in saris and the like.
1641,1982-83,The value of this concession is about Rs 1 crore.
1642,1982-83,These excise duty concessions I have just referred to entail a total revenue sacrifice of Rs 13.77 crores in a full year.
1643,1982-83,"Where the changes are to be made by Notifications effective from 28th February, 1982, copies thereof will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
1644,1982-83,My proposals will yield a net sum of about Rs 196.18 crores from excise duties and Rs 391.35 crores from customs duties.
1645,1982-83,The yield from duties under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Act will be Rs 2.30 crores in a full year.
1646,1982-83,"Taking all the proposals together, the net accrual to the Central exchequer in a full year will be Rs 487.60 crores and that to the States will be Rs 102.23 crores."
1647,1982-83,"I now have something to say on behalf of my Honlble colleague, the Minister of Communications."
1648,1982-83,"As the House is aware, postal services have been extended over the years throughout the country."
1649,1982-83,"There are over 1,40,000 post offices."
1650,1982-83,"The service is highly employment intensive, with more than 5.6 lakh employees including extra departmental staff."
1651,1982-83,Salaries and wages therefore constitute a major part of the operating expenses of the Postal Department.
1652,1982-83,The postal services are presently underpriced and the rates are inadequate even to meet the direct cost of several services.
1653,1982-83,"The grant of additional instalments of dearness allowance, and increases in other operating expenses, add significantly to these costs."
1654,1982-83,A revision of tariffs for some postal services has therefore become unavoidable.
1655,1982-83,"Accordingly, it is proposed to raise the rate for printed post cards from 20 paise to 25 paise, letter cards from 25 paise to 35 paise and envelopes of the lowest weight slab from 35 paise to 50 paise."
1656,1982-83,"There will be no increase in the rate of the ordinary post card which is generally used by the common man, even though this service involves an annual loss of about Rs 20 crores."
1657,1982-83,The tariff for bookpost articles is also proposed to e raised from 25 paise to 30 paise.
1658,1982-83,The postage for a registered newspaper has remained at the very low level of 2 paise for many years now.
1659,1982-83,"It is proposed to fix it at 5 paise for a single newspaper, with suitable adjustments for higher weight slabs."
1660,1982-83,"Even after this revision, the newspaper service will be subsidised to the extent of Rs 7 crores a year."
1661,1982-83,A memorandum showing the proposed tariffs is being circulated along with the Budget documents.
1662,1982-83,The changes would take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed by Parliament.
1663,1982-83,The revisions proposed are estimated to yield an additional revenue of Rs 35.33 crores in a full year and about Rs 26 crores in 1982 83.
1664,1982-83,"I had mentioned that the budgetary deficit at the existing rates of taxation would be Rs 2,085 crores."
1665,1982-83,"The tax measures proposed now, taken together with the reliefs and concessions, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 470 crores 28 to the Centre and Rs 63 crores to the States during 198283."
1666,1982-83,"Besides, the States will get an additional revenue of over Rs 2 crores from the increase in the duty on medicinal and toilet preparations."
1667,1982-83,I am taking credit for Rs 250 crores as receipts from the Capital Investment Bonds which I referred to earlier.
1668,1982-83,"This would leave an uncovered deficit of Rs 1,365 crores in 198283, which is substantially lower than the estimated deficit for the current year."
1669,1982-83,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have set forth a framework of policies with a view to encouraging higher savings, investment and production in the economy."
1670,1982-83,"Plan outlays are being stepped up substantially, particularly for sectors emphasized in the 20Point Programme."
1671,1982-83,Adequate provision has been made for national security.
1672,1982-83,"Despite these commitments, the budgetary deficit has been contained within reasonsable limits."
1673,1982-83,"To achieve this, a measure of resource mobilisation was inescapable."
1674,1982-83,"I have, however, taken care to see that resources are raised without building new inflationary pressures."
1675,1982-83,"In particular, I have tried to avoid placing burdens on the low and middle income groups."
1676,1982-83,The Budget constitutes a challenge to all those who are associated with the implementation of our development plan.
1677,1982-83,"It is an invitation to farmers, industry and labour for higher productivity; to the trading community for ensuring healthy marketing and distribution; and, indeed, to all our people, soldiers and civilians, to march forward shoulder to shoulder in the twin tasks of national development and defence."
1678,1982-83,"Sir, I now commend the Budget to the House."
1679,1983-84,I rise to present the Budget for the year 198384.
1680,1983-84,"The Economic Survey for 198283, placed before the House a few days ago, has given a detailed account of the trends in Indian economy during the current year."
1681,1983-84,"I shall, therefore, be brief in reviewing the economic situation.."
1682,1983-84,A drought year is always a difficult one for the economy.
1683,1983-84,The decline in agricultural production that the drought entails has an effect which goes beyond the rural sector.
1684,1983-84,The drop in the purchasing power of our farmers exerts a deflationary influence on industry.
1685,1983-84,The drought also affects power ‘generation and has an adverse impact on the external payments.
1686,1983-84,It reduces the resource base and at the same time it calls for an increase in relief expenditure.
1687,1983-84,The performance of the Indian economy in the year that is ending has to be viewed against this background.
1688,1983-84,That we have come through it without too much damage to our productive structure and achieved remarkable success in containing price inflation is a tribute to the resilience of our economy.
1689,1983-84,It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our policies of continued demand restraint and judicious supply management.
1690,1983-84,"Although the growth in gross domestic product this year will be lower than it has been in the two previous years, we willachieve an average growth rate of nearly 5 per cent over the three years, which is close to the target we set for ourselves in the Plan."
1691,1983-84,"At the same time, we have been able to maintain the tempo of investment."
1692,1983-84,"In other words, serious as has been the impact of drought, I believe we have not allowed it to affect the pace of development."
1693,1983-84,"On a pointtopoint basis, the increase in the wholesale prices in the last week of January was 3 per cent com pared with the annual rate of inflation of 5.7 per cent at the same time last year."
1694,1983-84,"The annual rate of increase in the consumer price index, as of December 1982, was also significantly lower  8 per cent as against 12.7 per cent in December, 1981."
1695,1983-84,The lower rate of inflation this year is particularly noteworthy considering that wholesale prices had increased on an average by 2.4 per cent per month in June and July 1982 because of speculative pressures generated by the delay in the monsoon.
1696,1983-84,"However, as a result of an appropriate mix of demand and supply management policies, the situation was speedily brought under control."
1697,1983-84,Monetary policy continued to be deployed flexibly.
1698,1983-84,The emphasis was on 1 the need for restraint while at the same time it sought to meet productive requirements for credit.
1699,1983-84,"On the supply side, action was taken to build up stocks and improve availability of foodgrains through timely imports."
1700,1983-84,Procurement efforts were stepped up so that the impact of a fall in the kharif output on stocks of foodgrains could be minimised.
1701,1983-84,Higher releases of sugar and edible oils were also arranged.
1702,1983-84,These and other supply management policies contributed significantly to the dampening of inflationary pressures after August 1982.
1703,1983-84,"As I have so often emphasised in this House in respect of the price situation, there can be no room for complacency."
1704,1983-84,The supply and demand situation in respect of sensitive commodities remains in delicate balance.
1705,1983-84,"While we have successfully weathered the immediate impact of the drought, we must remember that its effects are likely to be spread over a longer period than one season or one year."
1706,1983-84,"The international situation continues to be full of uncertainty and should there be a resurgence of inflation abroad, particularly in respect of commodities that we import, it could easily disturb our domestic price situation."
1707,1983-84,"We must also remain vigilant against antisocial elements, hoarders and black marketeers."
1708,1983-84,The kharif foodgrains production will be lower than last year because of adverse weather conditions.
1709,1983-84,"The indications, however, are that the rabi production may be somewhat better than last year."
1710,1983-84,"The output of cotton is likely to be close to the level of last year, while some decrease is expected in sugarcane and jute production."
1711,1983-84,The target of 2.35 million hectares for increase in the irrigation potential in 198283 is likely to be achieved.
1712,1983-84,"While the agricultural sector continues to be influenced by the vagaries of the weather, over the long run, we have been able to increase output significantly and to reduce the disruptive effects of a drought on the economy."
1713,1983-84,"This has demonstrated the basic soundness of our agricultural strategy of extending the irrigated areas, encouraging the use of fertilisers and high yielding varieties, widening the credit network, and ensuring fair and remunerative producer prices for the major crops."
1714,1983-84,Industrial production increased by 8.6 per cent in 198182.
1715,1983-84,"In the current year, the increase is likely to be about 4.5 per cent."
1716,1983-84,"For the period, April to December 1982, impressive increases were recorded in respect of critical industries, such as crude petroleum, which increased .by"
1717,1983-84,It is particularly heartening that thermal generation has shown substantial improvement and the plant load factor of thermal plants has also improved from 45.9 per cent during April  December 1981 to 47.6 per cent this year.
1718,1983-84,Sugar production is expected to be close to the record level of last year.
1719,1983-84,"The overall rate of growth in industrial production was, however, adversely affected by a sharp drop in output of cotton cloth and yarn."
1720,1983-84,Certain other sectors of industry also showed relatively low rates of growth because of slack demand or factors such as power constraints particularly in areas dependent on hydroelectricity.
1721,1983-84,Over the last thirty years significant progress has been made in expanding 2 and diversifying our industrial structure he investment climate is highly favourable and capital issues during the year have reached a record level.
1722,1983-84,"However, In order to accelerate and sustain a higher growth rate of production, it is essential that the corporate sector should pay greater attention to improving its own rate of savings by better utilisation of capacity and economy in conspicuous and wasteful expenditure."
1723,1983-84,"If the increasing requirements of funds for investment are to be adequately met, the corporate sector must learn to look towards a larger volume of internal generation of resources."
1724,1983-84,Borrowing can only supplement and not substitute corporate savings.
1725,1983-84,It is also essential to improve the productivity of past investments and reduce costs.
1726,1983-84,"Capital costs in the economy have increased, and due to delay in the implementation of projects, there is a decline in the returns that the community can legitimately monitor closely project implementation and operational efficiency."
1727,1983-84,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, there has been a marked improvement in the working of many public sector enterprises though some units continue to face problems."
1728,1983-84,Net profits of public sector units in the first nine months of this year increased to about Rs 360 crores compared with Rs 134 crores during the same period last year.
1729,1983-84,The process of building up the financial infrastructure continues apace.
1730,1983-84,The banking system has been extending its coverage to the rural areas; more rural banks have been opened and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development has commenced operations.
1731,1983-84,All this would help to extend further the benefits of the institutional credit to the rural sector.
1732,1983-84,Considerable progress has also been achieved in extending insurance to rural areas.
1733,1983-84,"In the past few years, our balance of payments situation has been a matter of concern."
1734,1983-84,"In my budget speech last year, I had taken the opportunity to indicate the Government’s strategy for restoring the viability in our balance of payments in the medium term."
1735,1983-84,"Briefly, the main elements of the strategy are to accelerate the pace of import substitution in critical sectors such as oil and fertilisers, to increase exports, and to improve the facilities available for remittances and investments by nonresidents of Indian origin."
1736,1983-84,The House would be happy to know that we have achieved considerable success in implementing this strategy.
1737,1983-84,The substantial increases in domestic production of petroleum and fertilisers have enabled us to reduce our dependence on imports of these items in the current year.
1738,1983-84,"Tariff policies are being effectively used to provide further protection to indigenous industries, wherever appropriate."
1739,1983-84,"Exports, which increased by 16 per cent in 198182, have shown a further growth of 18 per cent in the first seven months of 198283."
1740,1983-84,"This is good performance considering the uncongenial external environment marked by rising protectionism, 3 demand recession and near stagnation in world trade."
1741,1983-84,The trade deficit is likely to be lower in 198283.
1742,1983-84,"The rate of decline in our reserves, excluding International Monetary Fund transactions, has also come down and has averaged Rs 91 crores per month in this financial year up to end of January 1983 compared with Rs 175 crores per month during 198182."
1743,1983-84,"Our balance of payments adjustment has however, been made more difficult by an unfavourable international environment characterised by lack of political will in industrialised countries for economic cooperation."
1744,1983-84,"It is necessary that in association with the developing and other nonaligned countries, we continue to work for basic reform in the international financial and trading system."
1745,1983-84,India also has had to bear a disproportionate reduction in its share of concessional flows.
1746,1983-84,"In this situation, while recourse to a certain amount of commercial loans is unavoidable, we have to be extremely circumspect in relying upon this source as a means of financing current account deficits."
1747,1983-84,No sacrifice is too great where the nation’s security is concerned.
1748,1983-84,"At the same time, we cannot afford to slacken the development effort, however onerous the task may be as in the ultimate analysis, the nation’s security rests on economic strength."
1749,1983-84,"Despite a difficult resource situation, I am happy to inform the House that we were able to achieve a substantial step up in the Plan outlay in 198283."
1750,1983-84,The need for further economy and efficiency in the use of resources can hardly be overemphasised.
1751,1983-84,We must also continue to press ahead with additional resource mobilisation in a non inflationary way.
1752,1983-84,Fiscal policy has an important role to play in the task of harnessing the nation’s resources.
1753,1983-84,"In addition to appropriate adjustments in tax rates, the necessary administrative and legal measures are being taken to ensure that all sections of the community pay their taxes promptly."
1754,1983-84,"This Government is determined to plug avenues for tax evasion and avoidance, and to continue the fight against economic offences."
1755,1983-84,Raising the living standards of our people is possible only through a progressive increase in savings and productivity.
1756,1983-84,"The Indian people, we must gratefully acknowledge, have set standards of saving levels remarkable for a low income country."
1757,1983-84,"It is, however, essential that these savings are invested in assets which add to productive capacity and which directly benefit the people."
1758,1983-84,"In the past three years, several steps have been taken to encourage the savings habit."
1759,1983-84,The interest rate mechanism and the fiscal instrument have been used to provide an attractive return on savings in the form of financial assets.
1760,1983-84,In line with the decision to raise the interest rate on.
1761,1983-84,"Similarly, I propose to increase the rate of interest by 1 per cent on Special Deposits of Employees Provident Fund and other nonGovernment provident, gratuity and superannuation funds."
1762,1983-84,The improvement in the rate of return on these deposits would benefit workers and small savers.
1763,1983-84,"I also propose to liberalise the Public Provident Fund Scheme, which has become increasingly popular among selfemployed and others."
1764,1983-84,Subscribers will be allowed to continue their accounts beyond 15 years.
1765,1983-84,"The limit for annual subscription is also being raised to Rs 40,000."
1766,1983-84,"In the light of the changes that have taken place in the monetary and economic situation in the last two years, the Government, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, has reviewed the interest rates on advances by commercial banks."
1767,1983-84,It has been decided to reduce the ceiling rate of interest from 19.5 per cent to 18 per cent.
1768,1983-84,"The structure of interest rate is also being adjusted downwards for the benefit of agriculture, small scale industry and exports."
1769,1983-84,A separate announcement in this respect is being made by the Reserve Bank of India.
1770,1983-84,The Government has provided liberal incentives for attracting remittances and investments by nonresidents of Indian origin.
1771,1983-84,"In the light of experience, it has been decided to improve further the facilities available to nonresidents."
1772,1983-84,"Last year I had announced certain important concessions in respect of subscriptions by non residents to 6Year National Savings Certificates, which carry interest at 12 per cent per annum."
1773,1983-84,"In order to further improve their yield, I propose to allow an additional interest of one per cent on these certificates if these are subscribed for in foreign exchange."
1774,1983-84,I also have some other important proposals to which I shall refer later.
1775,1983-84,"I am sure that the House will agree with me that our policy framework meets the requirements of nonresidents, and that we can look forward to further strengthening of the bonds that exist between them and this country."
1776,1983-84,I shall now turn to the Revised estimates for 198283 and the Budget estimates for 198384.
1777,1983-84,REVISED ESTIMATES FOR 198283 25.
1778,1983-84,"The Budget estimate for the total expenditure in 198283 was Rs 29,219 crores of which Rs 11,345 crores was on Plan account and Rs 17,874 crores on non Plan account."
1779,1983-84,"As the year progressed, it became evident that we would need to enhance both these broad categories of expenditure."
1780,1983-84,"Despite the strains imposed on the economy by natural calamities, it has been our endeavour that outlays in respect of longterm development should not be allowed to suffer."
1781,1983-84,"One of my highest priorities, therefore, has been to protect the Plan and, in the result, the Revised estimates for Central Plan outlay are Rs 603 crores higher than those originally budgeted."
1782,1983-84,"Railway Plan outlay has been increased by Rs 195 crores, of which budgetary support will account for Rs 105 crores."
1783,1983-84,"The budgetary support for the power 5 sector will go up by Rs 62 crores, while assistance to National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development has been increased by Rs 100 crores."
1784,1983-84,The outlays for schemes of family welfare have been enhanced by Rs 50 crores.
1785,1983-84,"Plan provisions for rural water supply, agriculture and cooperation have also been stepped up, while the budgetary support for the Posts and Telegraphs Plan has been increased by Rs 75 crores owing, in this case, to a shortfall in internal resources."
1786,1983-84,"As against these increases, some reductions are expected in relation to Budget estimates of Plan expenditure in a few sectors."
1787,1983-84,"Overall, the budgetary support for the Central Plan is estimated to go up by Rs 262 crores to Rs 7605 crores."
1788,1983-84,"The Central assistance for State and Union Territory Plans is also being stepped up by Rs 380 crores, of which Rs 350 crores is the additional advance Plan assistance to States which have been affected by drought."
1789,1983-84,NonPlan expenditure will also be higher in the current year due to several factors.
1790,1983-84,"NonPlan grants to States will be higher by Rs 214 crores mainly due to additional assistance of Rs 147 crores for States affected by floods, cyclones and other natural calamities."
1791,1983-84,"Similarly, reflecting the buoyancy in small savings collections, nonPlan loans to States on this account will be higher by Rs 200 crores."
1792,1983-84,NonPlan loans for agricultural inputs have also been increased by Rs 50 crores.
1793,1983-84,The subsidy for indigenous fertilisers will go up by Rs 200 crores.
1794,1983-84,Additional loans of Rs 209 crores are required for certain public sector undertakings to enable them to meet their cash losses and interest and repayment obligations to the Government.
1795,1983-84,The provision for Defence expenditure will be higher by Rs 250 crores.
1796,1983-84,"To meet the temporary imbalance in the trade covered by Rupee Trade Agreements, the provision for Technical Credits has to be increased from Rs 80 crores to Rs 1280 crores."
1797,1983-84,"The increase in Technical Credits has been due to temporary and exceptional circumstances, and will be largely reversed during the year."
1798,1983-84,"Hon’ble Members will appreciate that in a year of weak global demand, our long standing trading relationship with the Socialist countries has been an important element in providing a measure of stability to our export sector."
1799,1983-84,"Excluding the loan of Rs 1743 crores to States, to which I shall refer later, the total nonPlan expenditure is likely to go up from Rs 17,874 crores to Rs 20,511 crores."
1800,1983-84,"Coming to receipts, as I mentioned at the beginning, the drought inevitably affects the income and resource base of the economy."
1801,1983-84,"Despite these adverse effects, the Budget estimates of receipts from Incometax and Customs duties are expected to be realised."
1802,1983-84,"However, receipts from Union excise duties may show a shortfall of Rs 220 crores."
1803,1983-84,"Apart from the impact of a lower growth in industrial production, there has been locking up of some revenues due to pending litigation."
1804,1983-84,Some shortfall in Corporation tax is also anticipated.
1805,1983-84,"The Centre’s net tax revenue after paying the 6 States’ share of taxes, is estimated at Rs 13,271 crores as against the Budget estimate of Rs 13,362 crores."
1806,1983-84,"Nontax revenue is, however, expected to show an improvement of Rs 613 crores mainly due to larger dividend payment by Railways, larger receipts from some public sector units, recovery from the Indian Dairy Corporation of the value of gift material supplied to it earlier and larger external grants."
1807,1983-84,"Capital receipts are also estimated to go up from Rs 10,249 crores to Rs 12,446 crores."
1808,1983-84,Receipts from market loans are estimated at Rs 3800 crores against the Budget estimate of Rs 3200 crores.
1809,1983-84,"As mentioned earlier, the recovery of Technical Credits will also go up from Rs 90 crores to Rs 1080 crores."
1810,1983-84,"The receipts from small savings are estimated to go up by, Rs 150 crores."
1811,1983-84,"The total receipts are thus estimated to go up from Rs 27, 844 crores to Rs 30, 563 crores."
1812,1983-84,"Taking into account the above and other variations in receipts and expenditure, the budgetary deficit in the current year is now estimated at Rs 1935 crores."
1813,1983-84,"This excludes the special loan assistance to States of Rs 1743 crores, which does not have any economic impact in the current year."
1814,1983-84,The larger deficit over Budget estimates in the current year has to be viewed against the background of weak demand in certain sectors of the economy.
1815,1983-84,That it has not had a destablising effect on the economy has been demonstrated by the price behaviour in recent months.
1816,1983-84,BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 198384 36.
1817,1983-84,"In framing the next year’s Budget, Mr. Speaker, Sir, my aim has been to provide for a large increase in the Plan outlay so that the pace of development, which we have assiduously built up, is not retarded."
1818,1983-84,"Even this increase, I am acutely aware, cannot be expected to fully meet the demand from various sectors, however pressing they may seem."
1819,1983-84,"Some reordering of priorities among different objectives and sectors has, therefore become necessary."
1820,1983-84,"This constitutes an increase of 26.1 per cent over the Plan outlay of Rs 11,000 crores in the Budget estimates for 1982 83."
1821,1983-84,"Coming on top of an increase of 27.6 per cent provided in the Budget for 198283, the proposed increase would enable us to meet our urgent requirements in critical sectors of the economy, and also provide a special thrust in respect of programmes meant for the welfare of the weaker sections of the society."
1822,1983-84,The Central Plan will be financed by a budgetary support of Rs 8390 crores and internal and extra budgetary resources of Rs 5480 crores.
1823,1983-84,Hon’ble Members are aware that the finances of several States have been under severe strain for some time.
1824,1983-84,"While the need for fiscal discipline cannot be overemphasised, an important objective of the Central Government has been to 7 ensure that, despite resource constraints, the State Plans also show a reasonable order of increase."
1825,1983-84,"Hon’ble Members would recall that in June 1982, I decided to clear States’ closing deficits of the previous year with a medium term loan of Rs 1743 crores."
1826,1983-84,I did so to help the States to readjust their finances and achieve adequate investment in their plans.
1827,1983-84,"In the current year, the Centre has provided nearly Rs 700 crores of assistance to States for drought and flood relief."
1828,1983-84,"Further, we have decided to increase Central assistance to States in the next two years by Rs 1650 crores over the balance available in the originally approved level."
1829,1983-84,This will augment the Plan resources of the States.
1830,1983-84,The States have responded by agreeing to enhance their resource mobilisation efforts.
1831,1983-84,"The total Plan outlay for 198384 of the States and Union Territories is now placed at Rs 11,625 crores."
1832,1983-84,"This represents an increase of 16.4 per cent over the finally approved outlay of Rs 9989 crores in 198283, the highest increase so far in the current plan period."
1833,1983-84,Central assistance for the Plan of the States and Union Territories will be Rs 4462 crores.
1834,1983-84,"Taken together, the Plan outlays of the Centre, States and Union Territories for 198384 will be Rs 25,495 crores, an increase of 21.5 per cent over the finally approved outlay of Rs 20,989 crores in 198283."
1835,1983-84,"In formulating the 198384 Plan, our primary concern has been to provide maximum support to those projects and programmes which can be of immediate benefit to the economy, and especially to the weaker sections of society."
1836,1983-84,"The outlays for the Revised 20Point Programme have been enhanced, and a special thrust is being given to programmes that benefit the poor directly."
1837,1983-84,"I have also taken the somewhat unconventional step of providing an additional Rs 300 crores over and above Rs 13,570 crores set apart specifically for the various schemes in the next year’s Central Plan."
1838,1983-84,This amount will be provided as grants to the States on the basis of their better performance in implementing specific programmes.
1839,1983-84,These programmes will benefit the weaker sections of the community and improve the functioning of the State Electricity Boards.
1840,1983-84,"The cooperation of the States is essential and, wherever appropriate, the guidelines to be issued, would provide for matching contributions by them."
1841,1983-84,"Out of this allocation, I am earmarking Rs 125 crores to assist small and marginal farmers to improve the productivity of their land."
1842,1983-84,"My colleague, the Minister of Agriculture, will be announcing the details of the scheme."
1843,1983-84,"Another Rs 125 crores would be distributed among the States on the basis of their performance in implementing programmes in Identified areas of high priority, which the Government will announce later."
1844,1983-84,The assistance for these purposes would be made available only to those States which demonstrate capacity to achieve targets over and above those implied in their approved Plans.
1845,1983-84,I have had occasion in the past to underline the importance of obtaining maximum returns out of existing investments.
1846,1983-84,The need for increasing the plant load factors in thermal power stations cannot be overemphasised.
1847,1983-84,"I, therefore, propose to set apart the balance of Rs 50 crores out of Rs 300 crores for incentive payments to State Electricity Boards for better performance."
1848,1983-84,Most of the State Electricity Boards achieved their peak plant load factors during the years 197577.
1849,1983-84,"Unfortunately, their recent performance has fallen far short of these levels."
1850,1983-84,I hope that this incentive would encourage the State Electricity Boards to reach and even surpass their earlier peaks.
1851,1983-84,"Apart from the above special allocation, the outlay for the 20Point Programme in the Central Sector Plan for 198384 is Rs 2747 crores representing an increase of 26.8 per cent over the outlay in the current year’s Plan."
1852,1983-84,The provision for these schemes in the approved Plan outlay of the States and Union Territories for 198384 will be Rs 7332 crores.
1853,1983-84,"Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that the total provision for 20Point Programme next year will thus exceed Rs 10,000 crores."
1854,1983-84,Next year’s programme also provides a high priority to agricultural development.
1855,1983-84,The total outlay for this sector is Rs 608 crores.
1856,1983-84,This includes Rs 200 crores for the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.
1857,1983-84,"Two major programmes, one for oil seeds development and another for dry land farming, both important elements in the 20Point Programme, will also be taken up for implementation in 1983 84."
1858,1983-84,"Further, a sum of Rs 800 crores is being provided for agricultural programmes in the approved Plan outlay of the States and Union Territories."
1859,1983-84,The outlays for irrigation and flood control are also being stepped up to Rs 116 crores in the Central Plan and Rs 2404 crores in the Plans of the States and Union Territories.
1860,1983-84,"The outlay for the National Rural Employment Programme, Integrated Rural Development Programme and other schemes of the Ministry of Rural Development would be Rs 480 crores in 1983 84 against the likely expenditure of Rs 419 crores in 1982 83."
1861,1983-84,The IRDP will enable about three million families in the rural areas to cross the poverty line.
1862,1983-84,The NREP will create about 350 million man days of work in the rural areas.
1863,1983-84,The provision for these programmes will be matched by the State Governments.
1864,1983-84,Hon’ble Members are aware that the Government has launched a crash programme for providing drinking water facilities in all problem villages.
1865,1983-84,The Plan outlay for 198283 visualised an allocation of Rs 127.5 crores by the Centre for the accelerated rural water supply programme.
1866,1983-84,Having regard to the progress in implementation the outlay has now been increased to Rs 155 crores.
1867,1983-84,A substantially higher outlay of Rs 200 crores has been provided for this programme in 198384.
1868,1983-84,"The States on their part will be setting apart Rs 319 crores and in all 48,000 more villages are expected to be covered in 198384."
1869,1983-84,One of the important programmes benefiting children is the Integrated 9 Child Development Services.
1870,1983-84,"With the higher target now set for the Sixth Plan, it is proposed to extend this scheme to 200 more projects in 198384 over and above the 620 projects so far covered."
1871,1983-84,Over half the total provision of Rs 60 crores for Department of Social Welfare will be accounted for by this scheme.

1878,1983-84,"Inclusive of the allocation for power development under Atomic Energy and Coal, the total outlay for the various power programmes in 198384 in the Central Plan will be Rs 1222 crores, representing an increase of 31.5 per cent over that for 198283."
1879,1983-84,"The target for addition to the capacity in 198384 in the Central Sector will be 1050 MW, double that of the current year."
1880,1983-84,"The outlay for Coal sector, including lignite, will be Rs 946 crores in 198384."
1881,1983-84,"The target for production of coal is 142 million tonnes, 9 million tonnes more than in the current year."
1882,1983-84,The provision for the various programmes of the Department of Steel in the Plan for 1983 84 is Rs 820 crores.

1898,1983-84,"Mr. Speaker, it has been my effort to contain the growth in the nonPlan expenditure."
1899,1983-84,"However, increases in certain important sectors have been inevitable."
1900,1983-84,"Taking into account the requirements of the country’s defence, a provision of Rs 5971 crores has been made for Defence against Rs 5350 crores in the Revised estimates for the current year."
1901,1983-84,"Due to increase in borrowings which are mainly used for development purposes and also higher borrowing costs, the provision for interest is placed at Rs 4700 crores against Rs 3950 crores in the Revised estimates for the current year."
1902,1983-84,The provision for food subsidy at Rs 800 crores will be higher by Rs 90 crores compared with the Revised estimates for the current year.

1907,1983-84,"The House would recall that last year, I had announced certain enhanced benefits for low paid pensioners."
1908,1983-84,I propose to provide some additional relief to this category of pensioners.
1909,1983-84,"From lst April 1983, the minimum amount of pension, including dearness relief, will be raised to Rs 160 per month and the minimum amount of family pension including dearness relief to Rs 150 per month."
1910,1983-84,"The total nonPlan expenditure in 198384 is estimated at Rs 21,984 crores against Rs 20,511 crores in Revised estimate 198283."
1911,1983-84,At this point I would like to refer to it matter concerning Government employees.
1912,1983-84,The employees had suggested some time ago that the Government may 11 appoint a Pay Body for revising pay scales.
1913,1983-84,The Third Pay Commission was appointed in April 1970 and made its report in 1973.
1914,1983-84,"Since then, over the years conditions have changed in several respects."
1915,1983-84,The employment under the Central Government has grown steadily larger.
1916,1983-84,"Changes have also taken place in the relativities in the emoluments of the employees of departments inter se, and also visavis other employees."
1917,1983-84,"For instance several State Governments have, through gay committees or Pay Commissions, sub stantially revised the pay scales and other benefits of their employees."
1918,1983-84,The Government feels it would be appropriate now to appoint the Fourth Central Pay Commission.
1919,1983-84,"Before the terms of reference of the Pay Commission are settled, the representatives of the employees would be consulted."
1920,1983-84,The membership of the Commission together with the terms of reference will be announced as soon as possible.
1921,1983-84,"So far as receipts in 198384 are concerned, the gross tax revenues at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 19,964 crores compared with Rs 17,910 crores in the Revised estimates."
1922,1983-84,The States’ share of taxes in 198384 is estimated at Rs 5088 crores compared with Rs 4639 crores in the current year.
1923,1983-84,"The net tax revenue of the Centre will thus be Rs 14,876 crores against Rs 13,271 crores in the current year."
1924,1983-84,The receipts from market loans are placed at Rs 4000 crores compared with R s. 3800 crores in the current year.
1925,1983-84,The recoveries of Technical Credits next year will be lower as the payments will also be less.
1926,1983-84,Small savings collections are expected to yield Rs 1700 crores next year against Rs 1550 crores this year.
1927,1983-84,"External assistance, net of loan repayments, is estimated at Rs 1940 crores against Rs 1724 crores in the current year."
1928,1983-84,"Taking into account these and other variations in receipts, the total receipts for 198384 are estimated at Rs 32,586 crores."
1929,1983-84,"These receipts include the effect of the changes in fare and freight rates of the Railways and in the Posts and Telegraphs tariffs as well as the continuance of the Compulsory Deposit Scheme for incometax payers beyond 31st March 1983, to which I shall refer later."
1930,1983-84,"The total expenditure is placed at Rs 34,836 crores."
1931,1983-84,The overall budgetary gap at existing rates of taxation will thus be Rs 2250 crores.
1932,1983-84,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, it is against the background of this review of budgetary outturn that I place my budget proposals before Hon’ble Members."
1933,1983-84,The Budget is more than an exercise in raising revenue or financing outlays.
1934,1983-84,"In a planned economy, it represents a potent instrument for achieving national objectives and sustaining the pace of development through appropriate financial and fiscal policies."
1935,1983-84,"I would, therefore, like to share with Hon’ble Members the philosophy of my budget."
1936,1983-84,"It aims at strengthening the productive forces in the economy, keeping a tight rein on inflation, encouraging savings both in the individual and corporate sectors and promoting essential investment."
1937,1983-84,The encouragement of savings has its corollary in discouraging 12 consumption.
1938,1983-84,Conspicuous consumption whether at individual or the corporate level has no place in a society such as ours.
1939,1983-84,"I have also taken this opportunity to review the effect of certain incentives and concessions in the tax law, and to modify them where appropriate."
1940,1983-84,"As we are placed now, the Budget must reflect the imperatives of attaining as speedily as possible a viable external payment situation and, therefore, seek to promote exports and effect economies in imports through a judicious use of the fiscal instrument."
1941,1983-84,"Within this overall framework, it has been my objective to keep the budgetary deficit for the next year relatively low."
1942,1983-84,"While it has been necessary to raise additional resources, I have tried to do so in a noninflationary way and without subjecting the low and middle income groups to additional burdens."
1943,1983-84,I shall first deal with my proposals in the area of noncorporate income taxes.
1944,1983-84,My aim is to provide some relief at the lower end of the slabs and specially to the salaried taxpayer.
1945,1983-84,"At the same time, it has been my endeavour to promote savings at the expense of consumption."
1946,1983-84,With this end in view I am providing for a more liberal application of the exemptions pertaining to savings.
1947,1983-84,Coming to my specific proposals let me begin with the unpleasant bit.
1948,1983-84,I propose an increase in the surcharge in the incometax on noncorporate taxpayers from the present level of 10 per cent to 12.5 per cent.
1949,1983-84,"The revenue yield from this measure would be Rs 47 crores in a, full year and Rs 37.6 crores in 198384."
1950,1983-84,This will accrue wholly to the Centre.
1951,1983-84,Considering the increased burden cast on the Centre on account of additional expenditure on national security and special assistance to the States.
1952,1983-84,Hon’ble Members will agree that this measure is justified.
1953,1983-84,Now for the good news.
1954,1983-84,"As a measure of relief to the salaried taxpayer I am proposing that the ceiling of standard deduction be increased from the present Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000."
1955,1983-84,The revenue loss as a result of this proposal is expected to be Rs 19 crores in a fun year and Rs 15.2 crores in 198384.
1956,1983-84,In recent years we have increased the exemption limits in respect of income tax.
1957,1983-84,"It has, however, been pointed out to me, with some justification, that the tax rate in the initial slab is somewhat high."
1958,1983-84,"I accordingly propose to split the initial slab, and for the first slab between Rs 15,001 and Rs 20,000 the tax rate will be 25 per cent instead of 30 per cent."
1959,1983-84,"The present rate of 30 per cent will, however, continue to apply to the slab Rs 20,001 to Rs 25,000."
1960,1983-84,"For the next slab between Rs 25,001 and Rs 30,000 the rate will be raised by 1 percentage point to 35 per cent."
1961,1983-84,"Even after the increase in rate of surcharge, individuals and certain categories of Hindu undivided families, etc. in the lower income slabs will pay less tax than at present."
1962,1983-84,The revenue effect of these proposals would be a loss of Rs 35 crores in a full year and Rs 28 crores in 198384.
1963,1983-84,"As a measure to stimulate savings, I propose to remove the ceiling of 30 per cent of gross total income in respect of savings in specified forms like life insurance, 13 provident funds, etc., while retaining the absolute monetary ceilings."
1964,1983-84,"Further, I intend widening the available media for savings by including National Savings Certificates, VI and VII issues."
1965,1983-84,This would be particularly helpful to those past middle age and towards the end of their working lives who might find it difficult to take advantage of life insurance and other contractual forms of savings.
1966,1983-84,The revenue loss from this measure is expected to be Rs 15 crores in a full year and Rs 12 crores next year.
1967,1983-84,"Income derived from specified longterm investments is exempt at present up to Rs 4,000 with an additional exemption of Rs 2,000 for interest on securities and bank deposits for a period exceeding one year."
1968,1983-84,"As a measure of simplification, I propose to merge these separate exemption limits and raise it from Rs 6,000 to Rs 7,000."
1969,1983-84,"The existing separate exemption of Rs 3,000 in respect of income from units of the Unit Trust of India will continue unchanged."
1970,1983-84,"As a result of these proposals, the aggregate of specified investment income which is exempt from tax would go up from Rs 9,000 to Rs 10,000."
1971,1983-84,This should help to stimulate savings further.
1972,1983-84,Hon’ble Members would appreciate that in sum the effect of the above proposals would be such as not to increase the tax liability of assessees in the lower brackets of the tax scale notwithstanding the increase in the surcharge.
1973,1983-84,"As for the rest, as I intend the surcharge primarily to affect consumption rather than savings I have sought to combine the surcharge with measures designed to increase personal savings in specified financial assets."
1974,1983-84,"I propose to extend the operation of the Compulsory Deposit Scheme Incometax Payers Act, 1974, by a period of two years."
1975,1983-84,"At present, persons over 70 years of age are exempted from the requirement of making deposits."
1976,1983-84,I propose to lower this limit from 70 to 65 years.
1977,1983-84,"Those who attain the age of 65 years on 1st April, 1983, would be entitled to withdraw, at their option, the balance of the deposits to their credit, on or after 1st June, 1983."
1978,1983-84,At present no tax on capital gains is charged in cases where the net consideration received on transfer of a capital asset is invested in 7Year National Rural Development Bonds.
1979,1983-84,It has been pointed out to me that this maturity period is rather long.
1980,1983-84,"In order to provide investment choices and with a view to ensuring that resources flow into desired directions, I propose to extend the exemption to cover investment of the net consideration in a new Central Government Bond of 3 years’ maturity."
1981,1983-84,"As I indicated earlier, I have decided to liberalise further the tax incentives in respect of nonresident Indians investing in India."
1982,1983-84,I propose to levy a flat rate of tax of 20 per cent plus surcharge on incomes derived by such persons from their specified investments in India made through foreign exchange remittances.
1983,1983-84,"These investments will include shares and debentures of Indian companies, units of the Unit Trust of 14 India and Government securities."
1984,1983-84,Longterm capital gains arising on transfer of such assets will also attract tax at the proposed flat rate.
1985,1983-84,Such incomes will also not be taken into account in computing their other Indian incomes.
1986,1983-84,"They would not have to go through the procedures involved in submission of tax returns, provided they have no other income in India and tax at the proposed flat rate has been deducted from their income."
1987,1983-84,These non residents will also have the option of paying tax at the normal rates applicable to resident taxpayers.
1988,1983-84,Such investments will also be exempt from wealth tax.
1989,1983-84,Gifts of such assets made by Indian citizens and persons of Indian origin settled abroad to their relatives in India will also be exempt from gift tax.
1990,1983-84,I shall now deal with my proposals in respect of the corporation tax.
1991,1983-84,Earlier in my speech I had referred to the need to accelerate investment through higher internal generation by companies and curbing conspicuous consumption.
1992,1983-84,I believe that both the Government and the companies can contribute towards this objective.
1993,1983-84,"It has been pointed out to me by several committees and representative organisations of industry that given the rising costs of replacement and modernisation, the internal funds available with the corporate sector are inadequate."
1994,1983-84,I find substance in this argument.
1995,1983-84,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the general rate of depreciation in respect of plant and machinery from 10 per cent to 15 per cent."
1996,1983-84,"I am also raising the monetary limit for 100 per cent writeoff from the present level of Rs 750 to Rs 5,000 in respect of small items of plant and machinery."
1997,1983-84,The other related benefits which new investment in plant and machinery now enjoy will continue.
1998,1983-84,The revenue loss on account of liberalisation of provisions relating to depreciation would be Rs 140 crores in a full year and Rs 112 crores in 198384.
1999,1983-84,Hon’ble Members would recall that last year I had proposed to allow depreciation at 30 per cent of the cost of devices and systems for energy saving and for minimising environmental pollution and for conservation of natural resources.
2000,1983-84,I propose to go farther and allow 100 per cent depreciation on devices and systems for energy saving.
2001,1983-84,"In regard to devices and systems for minimising environmental pollution and for conservation of natural resources, I propese to raise the investment allowance from 25 per cent to 35 per cent."
2002,1983-84,"To encourage industries to shift from urban areas and as a measure of decongesting our overcrowded cities and reducing pollution, the capital gain arising from transfer of buildings or lands used for the purposes of business is exempt from tax if it is used for acquiring lands or constructing buildings for the purposes of business at the new place."
2003,1983-84,I propose to extend this exemption from tax.
2004,1983-84,I had occasion earlier to refer to the lowering of the interest rate structure.
2005,1983-84,"As my contribution to the relief being provided by banks and with a view to encouraging production and investment, I propose to reduce the rate of tax charged under the 15 Interesttax Act to half of the prevailing rate."
2006,1983-84,"In respect of the chargeable interest arising after 31st March, 1983, the rate of interesttax will be reduced from seven per cent to three and a half per cent."
2007,1983-84,About half of the loss of Rs 130 crores on account of this measure will be recouped by the additional tax revenue as a consequence of the lower deductible cost of borrowing to business and industry.
2008,1983-84,My other important objective in respect of the corporate tax structure is to provide incentive for higher production and exports.
2009,1983-84,"I am, therefore, continuing the two schemes announced last year and making them more liberal."
2010,1983-84,"As regards the scheme for excess production, I will come to the details later while discussing my proposals in respect of indirect taxes."
2011,1983-84,In respect of exports the scheme announced by me last year provided some tax relief to exporters whose export turnover for any year exceeded that of the immediately preceding year by more than 10 per cent.
2012,1983-84,The total relief available under last year’s scheme was also subject to a maximum of 10 per cent of tax payable.
2013,1983-84,I now propose to simplify and liberalise the scheme and remove both the minimum qualifying amount and limit of relief.
2014,1983-84,Exporters will be entitled to deduct 5 per cent of their incremental turnover in computing their taxable income.
2015,1983-84,"Thus, under the new scheme all increments in export turnover will be entitled to relief."
2016,1983-84,Exports of all goods will qualify for this concession excepting a few specified items.
2017,1983-84,"As the new provision will take effect from the assessment year 198384, the provision made last year is proposed to be deleted."
2018,1983-84,"Hon’ble Members must be aware of the phenomenon of companies which are flourishing, but are paying no tax at all, or only a nominal tax."
2019,1983-84,This is largely due to these companies availing of the tax incentives and concessions available under the provisions of the Incometax Act.
2020,1983-84,It has been a matter of concern to us that under our tax system several highly profitable companies are able to reduce their tax liability to zero even though they continue to pay high dividends.
2021,1983-84,It seems reasonable that profitable and prosperous companies should contribute at least a small portion of their profits to the national exchequer at a time when other and less better off sections of society are bearing a burden.
2022,1983-84,I therefore propose to provide that fiscal incentives and concessions shall not absorb more than 70 per cent of the profits.
2023,1983-84,"This would secure that companies pay a minimum tax, on at least 30 per cent of their profits."
2024,1983-84,The differential rates of tax in the case of domestic companies depending upon the total income of the company are proposed to be removed.
2025,1983-84,"As a measure of simplification, I propose to levy incometax at a flat rate of 25 per cent on the gross amount of interest received by foreign companies on loans advanced by them in foreign currency."
2026,1983-84,The incometax payable by companies at present bears a surcharge of 2.5 per cent of such incometax.
2027,1983-84,I propose to raise the rate of surcharge to 5 per cent.
2028,1983-84,"However, in lieu of the additional surcharge payable by them, companies will be offered the option to make deposits with the Industrial Development Bank of India under a scheme to be notified by the Government."
2029,1983-84,I am not taking credit for any revenue gain from this measure in the expectation that the additional surcharge would in fact be deposited by the companies with Industrial Development Bank of India.
2030,1983-84,The amount so deposited should help to provide funds for modernisation and thus flow back to the corporate sector.
2031,1983-84,Our corporate tax structure is riddled with a large number of different kinds of deductions.
2032,1983-84,"While each deduction may seem to have a merit the aggregate effect is to complicate tax administration, provide opportunities for misuse and reduce the growth of revenues."
2033,1983-84,"As a step towards rationalisation of this structure, I have reviewed the various deductions."
2034,1983-84,"The Incometax Act at present provides for weighted deduction of expenses incurred by a company or a cooperative society which uses products of agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy or poultry farming as raw material."
2035,1983-84,The expenses in respect of which weighted deduction is allowed do not relate directly to the assessee’s business.
2036,1983-84,I propose to provide that such companies or cooperative societies would henceforth be entitled only to the deduction of expenses and not to the weighted deduction.
2037,1983-84,The Incometax Act provides deductions for expenditure or contributions made by assessees for approved programmes of rural development.
2038,1983-84,"Ongoing programmes approved by’ the prescribed authority will continue to enjoy the benefits of the deduction upto the terminal date in respect of time bound programmes and February 28, 1984 in other cases."
2039,1983-84,"However, with a view to preventing possibility of misuse, it is proposed not to allow any further deductions on this score."
2040,1983-84,It is not the intention of the Government to deprive genuine rural development programmes of corporate support.
2041,1983-84,"The Government would shortly establish a fund called the Prime Minister’s Fund for Rural Development, contributions to which would enjoy exemption under the Incometax Act."
2042,1983-84,"The special deduction allowed hitherto in respect of profits and gains from business of livestock breeding or poultry or dairy farming and from business of growing mushrooms, is proposed to be withdrawn."
2043,1983-84,"I see little justification for continuing this fiscal concession to these businesses, in view of the room for abuse."
2044,1983-84,"However, in order to encourage and strengthen primary cooperatives for oilseeds, fruits and vegetables, I propose to provide full exemption from tax for such cooperatives as in the case of dairy cooperatives."
2045,1983-84,The tax concession in relation to horizontal transfer of technology was introduced in 1969.
2046,1983-84,The objective was to discourage repetitive import of foreign technology.
2047,1983-84,I find that the concession has lent itself to be used for tax avoidance.
2048,1983-84,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw this concession effective from assessment year 198485."
2049,1983-84,"Hon’ble Members must be aware of lavish and wasteful expenditure by trade and industry, particularly on travelling, advertisement and the like."
2050,1983-84,"With a view to inculcating a climate of austerity and providing a disincentive to unproductive, avoidable and ostentatious spending by trade and industry, I propose to provide that 20 per cent of such expenditure will be disallowed in computing the taxable profits."
2051,1983-84,The Incometax Act provides for the disallowance of entertainment expenses beyond a ceiling and for total disallowance of expenses on maintenance of guest houses.
2052,1983-84,I proposeto define the terms “entertainment expenditure” and “guest house” to remove doubts about the correct import of these expressions.
2053,1983-84,The revenue from these measures in a full year will be Rs 50 crores and in 198384 Rs 40 crores.
2054,1983-84,"The effect of these measures, combined with the increase in depreciation allowance, will be to provide a marked preferential tax treatment of investment as against unproductive expenditure."
2055,1983-84,"Several cases have come to notice where taxpayers do not discharge their statutory liability such as in respect of excise duty, employer’s contribution to provident fund, Employees’ State Insurance Scheme, for long period of time."
2056,1983-84,"For the purpose of their incometax assessments, they nonetheless claim the liability as deduction even as they take resort to legal action, thus depriving the Government of its dues while enjoying the benefit of nonpayment."
2057,1983-84,"To curb such practices I propose to provide that Irrespective of the method of accounting followed by the taxpayers, a statutory liability will be allowed as a deduction in computing the taxable profits only in the year and to the extent it is actually paid."
2058,1983-84,This would result in a revenue gain of Rs 100 crores in a full year and Rs 80 crores in 1983 84.
2059,1983-84,It has come to my notice that some persons have been trying to avoid personal wealthtax liability by forming closelyheld companies to which they transfer many items of their wealth.
2060,1983-84,"As companies are not chargeable to wealthtax, and the value of the shares of such companies does not also reflect the real worth of the assets of the company, those who hold such unproductive assets in closely held companies are able to successfully reduce their wealthtax liability to a substantial extent."
2061,1983-84,"With a view to circumventing tax avoidance by such persons, I propose to revive the levy of wealthtax in a limited way in the case of closelyheld companies."
2062,1983-84,"Accordingly, I am proposing the levy of wealthtax in the case of closelyheld companies at the rate of 2 per cent on the net wealth represented by the value of specified assets, such as, jewellery."
2063,1983-84,Buildings used by the company as factory.
2064,1983-84,"The sum of my proposals in respect of the corporate sector, the Hon’ble Members would appreciate is to ensure that every profitable company pays some tax in the year in which profits accrue, that loopholes are plugged and the number of deductions is reduced, that more funds are available for modernisation and re investment, that costs are reduced through lower interest charges and reduction in 18 conspicuous expenses, and that higher production, particularly for exports, receives due encouragement."
2065,1983-84,Many charitable and religious trusts and institutions no doubt do laudable work.
2066,1983-84,"Unfortunately, it is also true that many are used as a medium for tax avoidance, accumulation of wealth and means of patronage and I cannot remain a disinterested spectator."
2067,1983-84,It is time some steps were taken to set matters right.
2068,1983-84,"The Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1975 had laid down an investment pattern for trust funds, and trusts which failed to comply with this investment pattern from accounting years commencing after 31st March, 1978 were liable to forfeit tax exemption."
2069,1983-84,"However, having regard to the practical difficulties involved and to ensure a more orderly changeover, this date was extended in 1977 by three years."
2070,1983-84,"As the whole gamut of the provisions relating to charitable and religious trusts was under consideration by the Economic Administration Reforms Commission, the date for the new pattern of investment was again extended last year by a further period of one year."
2071,1983-84,I have since considered the matter carefully.
2072,1983-84,"I see no justification for permitting investment of trust funds in business concerns, including shares of companies in the private sector."
2073,1983-84,"I accordingly propose to provide that all trust funds should be invested in specified modes, such as."
2074,1983-84,"Government securities, units of the Unit Trust of India, deposits with scheduled banks, approved financial corporations, etc. investment in immovable properties will, however, continue to be allowed."
2075,1983-84,"I am giving notice to all charitable and religious trusts to divest their share holdings and other investment in business concerns by 30th November, 1983."
2076,1983-84,"However, trusts will be allowed to keep shares in companies, which formed part of the original corpus as on June 1, 1973 and bonus shares received up to that date."
2077,1983-84,Some trusts carry on business on commercial lines and derive income there from.
2078,1983-84,There is no reason why such business income should not be brought to tax.
2079,1983-84,"I, therefore, propose that business income of all charitable and religious trusts including those which have hitherto been exempted by notification will be brought to tax with effect from assessment year 198485."
2080,1983-84,Trusts having business income will also be required to conform to the new investment pattern if they wish to seek tax exemption in respect of their other income.
2081,1983-84,Hon’ble Members are no doubt aware that estate duty in respect of agricultural land is a State subject and that the Centre has levied estate duty on agricultural land only by virtue of resolutions passed in this regard by States enabling the Union to do so.
2082,1983-84,Our experience is that the valuation of agricultural land leads to administrative difficulties and litigation.
2083,1983-84,The yield from this levy has also not been significant over the past several years.
2084,1983-84,"Moreover, after the abolition of wealthtax on agricultural land, including plantations, there is little practical justification for continuing the levy of estate duty on agricultural land."
2085,1983-84,"I, therefore, propose to remove the levy of estate duty on agricultural land."
2086,1983-84,"Since the Estate Duty Act can be amended 19 only after the necessary resolutions of State Legislatures, a Bin for giving effect to this proposal will be introduced later."
2087,1983-84,The revenue loss on account of the reduction in interesttax will be Rs 104 crores next year.
2088,1983-84,"Taking into account the estimated recoupment of part of this loss, my corporation tax proposals will yield Rs 104 crores next year."
2089,1983-84,My proposals in regard to incometax will lead to net revenue accrual of Re. 25.
2090,1983-84,I turn now to my proposals in the area of indirect taxation.
2091,1983-84,"Mr. Speaker, the House to aware that for some years now our balance of payments has been under."
2092,1983-84,Despite this we have sought to maintain an import regime which provides adequate access to imported inputs such as raw material and capital goods to the priority sectors.
2093,1983-84,"At the same time, I would not like that our policies should be taken advantage of by exporters abroad facing difficult market conditions by selling unduly cheap in the Indian market to the detriment of Indian industry."
2094,1983-84,I believe we should use the instrument of customs duties not only to help revenue collection but to support our balance of payments and industrial expansion.
2095,1983-84,In framing my proposals I have also tried to minimise tax avoidance and evasion and taken care to see that the measures would not spur inflation 107.
2096,1983-84,"Taking customs duties first, my principal proposal is to continue the auxiliary duties of customs first imposed from 1973 and since renewed annually."
2097,1983-84,I propose also to raise with certain exceptions the present effective rates by 5 percentage points.
2098,1983-84,"The statutory rate of auxiliary, duty is proposed to be kept at 50 per cent, and the maximum effective rate at only 35 per cent."
2099,1983-84,The cushion of 15 per cent will help us take care of any need for higher duty levels which may become necessary for reasons such as support for indigenous production.
2100,1983-84,Newsprint and crude petroleum would not be subject to the increase in auxiliary duty.
2101,1983-84,"The existing full exemption from auxiliary duties on essential items like fertilizers, kerosene, high speed diesel oil would be continued."
2102,1983-84,The revenue gain as a result of this proposal would be Rs 254.5 crores in a full year.
2103,1983-84,My next proposal relates to chemicals.
2104,1983-84,This group of commodities is in general subject to a basic rate of customs duty at 60 per cent ad valorem.
2105,1983-84,"With the significant fall in the international prices of chemicals, I believe it would be appropriate to raise the tariff rate to 100 per cent ad valorem and the general effective rate to 70 per cent ad valorem."
2106,1983-84,Tariff rates of 40 per cent and 100 per cent applicable to certain groups of chemicals are also being raised on the same lines.
2107,1983-84,"However, pharmaceutical chemicals and drugs, insecticide, pesticide and fungicide chemicals."
2108,1983-84,This measure will yield Rs 37.5 crores in a full year.
2109,1983-84,I also propose to raise the effective basic importduty on zinc metal from 45 per cent to 55 per cent ad valorem and that on lead metal from 40 per cent to 56 20 per cent ad valorem.
2110,1983-84,The existing parflail exemption from countervailing duty on lead scrap and waste also proposed to be withdrawn.
2111,1983-84,"These measures will yield additional revenue of Rs 12.8 crores in a fun year, and would also improve the financial viability of indigenous producers."
2112,1983-84,"For the benefit of our electronic industry, the existing concessional basic import duty of 45 per cent ad valorem is proposed to be extended to four more items of raw materials and components."
2113,1983-84,"Besides, the concessional basic import duty of 35 per cent ad valorem in respect of capital goods is proposed to be extended to 14 more items."
2114,1983-84,These steps would cost the exchequer Rs 1.22 crores in a financial year.
2115,1983-84,Another concession relates to bonafide gifts received from abroad by post or air freight.
2116,1983-84,The existing dutyfree value limits for such gifts were fixed in 1968.
2117,1983-84,"I propose to raise the dutyfree limit for bonafide gifts of food articles and medicines imported by post or as air freight, and other items imported by post to Rs 200."
2118,1983-84,"This liberalisation, I am sure, would be welcomed by those who receive genuine gifts from their friends and relatives abroad."
2119,1983-84,The revenue sacrifice would be Rs 3.71 crores in a full year.
2120,1983-84,I also propose to rationalise and liberalise the provisions relating to import duties on articles of baggage which are brought by passengers returning to India.
2121,1983-84,The present dutyfree limit for baggage is Rs 1000 fixed in 1978.
2122,1983-84,I propose to raise this limit to Rs 1250 for adults with corresponding increase for minors and other categories of passengers.
2123,1983-84,"Keeping in mind the needs of Indian workers abroad who are generally engaged on contracts of one year and who then return to India, I propose a higher dutyfree allowance of Rs 5000 for them for used household effects with some exceptions."
2124,1983-84,"The rate of basic duty on the first dutiable value slab will remain 130 per cent, while on the value in excess of the first dutiable slab it is being reduced from 300 per cent to 200 per cent ad valorem except for a few articles."
2125,1983-84,Auxiliary duty will be in addition.
2126,1983-84,The list of articles of baggage in respect of which dutyfree entry will not be admissible is being shortened.
2127,1983-84,I am sure these measures would reduce the rigours of customs clearance for incoming passengers.
2128,1983-84,I do not anticipate any fan in revenue because of this liberalisation.
2129,1983-84,"A few amendments to the Customs Act, 1982 are also proposed to streamline the working of the department in the field and to enable more efficient revenue collections."
2130,1983-84,The changes relate mainly to the setting up of the inland Container Depots and provisions relating to warehousing and drawback.
2131,1983-84,A fair amount of customs revenue remains blocked because of inordinately long warehousing of goods and it is therefore proposed to reduce the warehousing time to one year in the case of non consumable stores and to three months for other goods.
2132,1983-84,As a measure to expedite drawback payments.
2133,1983-84,It is being provided that for claiming drawback it would be sufficient if the goods are entered for export to a place outside India.
2134,1983-84,The minimum amount for which a claim for drawback would be entertained is also being raised from Rs 5 to Rs  50.
2135,1983-84,Power is also proposed to be taken under the Customs Act for the Government to fix effective rates of duty on a bash different from the one spelt out in the tariff.
2136,1983-84,"Thus, if the tariff, fate of duty is on ad valorem basis, the Government would have the power to fix effective rates of duty on the basis of weight, etc. 115."
2137,1983-84,"Sir, coming now to my proposals in respect of excise duties my objective has been primarily to mop up windfall gains where we believe they exist, and to limit the incidence of additional levies on individual items to relatively small proportions."
2138,1983-84,I have also kept to the fore the important objective of promoting the small scale sector which has been a nursery for entrepreneurship in the country and has also helped to diffuse the concentration of economic power.
2139,1983-84,I propose to continue the levy of special excise duties in 198384 at the existing rates.
2140,1983-84,"Cement prices, as Hon’ble Members are aware, have been ruling high in the markets."
2141,1983-84,To mop up undue profits.
2142,1983-84,I propose to raise the basic excise duty on cement from Rs 135 to Rs 205 per tonne for the commonly used variety of cement.
2143,1983-84,"The basic excise duty on cement produced in minicement plants will also go up from Rs 100 to Rs 170, thus maintaining the existing duty differential of Rs 35 per metric tonne in favour of the mini plants."
2144,1983-84,The revenue gain would be Rs 182 crores in a fun year by way of Central excise duties and Rs 6 crores by way of countervailing duties on imports of cement.
2145,1983-84,Central Excise Tariff item 68 covers a miscellany of goods not elsewhere specified in the Tariff.
2146,1983-84,The rate of duty has been unchanged at 8 per cent ad valorem from 1979.
2147,1983-84,I propose to raise the rate now to 10 per cent ad valorem.
2148,1983-84,This measure is liekely to yield an additional revenue of Rs 120 crores by way of Central excise duties and Rs 60 crores by way of countervailing duties in a full year.
2149,1983-84,The increase would be basically on finished goods since the raw materials and manufactured inputs covered by this Tariff item will continue to be eligible for duty credit as at present.
2150,1983-84,"I have taken care to protect the small scale sector, as I will be mentioning later."
2151,1983-84,Hon’ble Members would recall that in my Budget last year several duty changes were made to encourage the production of blends with the desirable proportions of polyester.
2152,1983-84,"As a further measure in this area, I now propose to give a competitive edge to polyestercotton blended fabrics, visavis polyesterviscose blended fabrics."
2153,1983-84,The incidence of basic and additional duty on polyester cotton fabrics containing more than 40 per cent but less than 50 per cent polyester is proposed to be reduced from 15 per cent ad valorem to 6.5 per cent ad valorem.
2154,1983-84,"These concessional rates would not, however, apply if polyester filament yarn is used."
2155,1983-84,The overall incidence to duty on cotton yam containing more than 40 per cent but less than 50 per cent polyester is also being reduced from Bs.11.25 to Rs 7.5 per kilogram.
2156,1983-84,The revenue sacrifice entailed in these changes is Rs 19.40 crores in a fun year.
2157,1983-84,The effective duty on viscose staple fibre is being raised from Rs 4 per kilogram to Rs 5 per kilogram.
2158,1983-84,"Further, to discourage the increasing imports of this fibre, I propose to raise the import duty on ordinary viscose staple fibre from 30 per cent to 40 per cent ad valorem and on improved varieties of viscose staple fibre also to 40 per cent ad valorem."
2159,1983-84,Therevenue gain will be Rs 5.6 crores.
2160,1983-84,"In the case of imported polyester fibre, considering the gap between its landed cost and domestic prices, it is proposed to raise the effective duty on polyester staple fibre by Rs 9 per kilogram."
2161,1983-84,This would yield Rs 9 crores in a full year.
2162,1983-84,Polyester filament yarn is used in comparatively higher priced fabrics and I propose to raise the effective excise duty by Rs 7.50 per kilogram on filament yarns of textile applications.
2163,1983-84,This increase would be equally incident on imported filament yarn by way of higher countervailing duty.
2164,1983-84,The increase would not be applicable to polyester filament yarn of 750 deniers and above which goes into industrial applications.
2165,1983-84,The revenue gain in a fun year would be Rs 22.5 crores by way of excise duties and Rs 5.6 crores by way of countervailing duties.
2166,1983-84,"In step with the above increase, I also propose to raise the effective duty on nylon filament yarn of textile deniers by the same margin."
2167,1983-84,The additional revenue yield will be Rs 15.5 crores by way of Central excise duties and Rs 50 lakhs by way of countervailing duties in a full year.
2168,1983-84,As a measure to combat tax avoidance I propose to change the basis of duty from ad valorem to ad valoremcumspecific rate or specific rate on a few commodities.
2169,1983-84,"In respect of paper, while adopting an ad valoremcumspecific rate; I propose to fix a uniform rate for printing, writing and most of the other varieties of paper and paper board."
2170,1983-84,"The effective basic duty for kraft paper will be 10 per cent ad valorem plus Rs 1810 per metric tonne and for most of the other varieties of paper and paper board, 10 per cent ad valorem plus Rs 1430 per metric tonne."
2171,1983-84,"The existing concessional basic rate of 5 per cent ad valorem in respect of white printing paper supplied to Director General, Supplies and Disposals or for educational purposes would, however, continue."
2172,1983-84,I have also reviewed the present concessions available to small paper mills.
2173,1983-84,The linking of the concession enjoyed by this sector to the installed capacity of a plant has been posing some practical problems.
2174,1983-84,"I, therefore, propose to rationalise the concessions to this sector on the basis of quantum of clearances in a financial year."
2175,1983-84,The extent of exemption is also being suitably modified which should encourage the small paper mills to increase their production substantially.
2176,1983-84,"Rates of duty for paper manufactured in such paper mills using unconventional raw material will be Rs 560, Rs 900 or Rs 1120 per tonne depending on whether the clearances of paper and paper board from such paper mills in the preceding financial year did not exceed 3000 tonnes, 7500 tonnes or 16500 tonnes respectively."
2177,1983-84,In regard to aerated waters it is proposed to fix specific rates of duty to replace the existing ad valorem rates.
2178,1983-84,"The effective basic duty for a bottle of 200 millilitres will be, 5 paise for soda and 30 paise for others."
2179,1983-84,The concessions available to small scale manufacturers would continue.
2180,1983-84,The present ad valorem rate in respect of motor cars is being converted into ad valoremcumspecific rate.
2181,1983-84,The effective rates would be based on the engine capacity and would be different for petrol driven and diesel driven cars.
2182,1983-84,"In the case of tyres used in twowheeled vehicles and tractors and tyres of specified sizes for trailers, the present basic tariff rate of 60 per cent is proposed to be reduced to 25 per cent which is the level of the present effective rates of duty."
2183,1983-84,The House may recall that in November last the concessional rates of duty on cigarettes were withdrawn and cigarettes were made liable to pay statutory rates.
2184,1983-84,The revenue realisations had been affected inter alia on account of disputes over the method of arriving at the assessable value.
2185,1983-84,With a view to ending the room for uncertainty once for all I propose to fix specific rates of duty in respect of cigarettes.
2186,1983-84,These rates of duty would be linked to their retail sale prices printed on the cigarette packs.
2187,1983-84,"Keeping in view the fact that the consumption of cheaper cigarettes is large, I have also sought to have a graded levy based on retail prices."
2188,1983-84,"The duty now proposed will, at the lowest slab, be Rs 35 per thousand cigarettes."
2189,1983-84,I expect that this measure would help the Government to realise the revenue expected from this item.
2190,1983-84,All these antiavoidance measures would help secure revenue of the order of Rs 50 crores which otherwise might have been avoided.
2191,1983-84,There have been strong representations from many quarters that the existing scheme of concession in excise duty for the small scale sector hampers continuous growth and should be liberalised.
2192,1983-84,I have reviewed the matter.
2193,1983-84,"Under the general scheme applicable to 70 specified groups of commodities at present, manufacturers are eligible to get full duty exemption upto first clearances of Rs 7.5 lakhs and the concessional rate of 75 per cent of the duty payable on clearances in excess of Rs 7.5 lakhs but upto Rs 15 lakhs."
2194,1983-84,I propose to raise the upper limit from Rs 15 lakhs to Rs 25 lakhs.
2195,1983-84,"At the same time, I propose to reduce the limit of full exemption from Rs 7.5 lakhs to Rs 5 lakhs."
2196,1983-84,"The clearances in excess of Rs 5 lakhs upto Rs 25 lakhs would, however, enjoy a concessional rate of duty of 75 per cent of the normal duty payable."
2197,1983-84,"Two commodity groups, namely cosmetics and toilet preparations, and the other, refrigerating and airconditioning appliances and machinery and their parts, bear high rates of excise duty and will be deleted from the general scheme."
2198,1983-84,An alternative exemption scheme has been provided for these items under which small manufacturers with total clearances upto Rs 2.5 lakhs would be completely exempt from payment of duty and those with turnover
2199,1983-84,"As regards the exemption available to the small scale manufacturers of goods falling under Tariff item 68, I propose to raise the eligibility limit of Rs 30 lakhs by way of value of clearances in the previous year to Rs 40 lakhs."
2200,1983-84,This measure would help the small scale units to avail of the benefit of exemption while expanding their turnover.
2201,1983-84,"With the increase in the rate of duty from 8 per cent to 10 per cent which I mentioned earlier, the amount of the new concessions can go up to Rs 3 lakhs against Rs 2.4 lakhs till now."
2202,1983-84,"For both the schemes, I propose to exclude the clearances of exempted goods, other than those exempted under small scale exemptions, from the computation of value of clearances for the purpose of determining the eligibility as well as availment of exemption from duty."
2203,1983-84,The net revenue effect of all these concessions for the small scale sector will be a loss of Rs 5 crores in a full year.
2204,1983-84,"As part of the 1982 Budget, I had announced an excise duty relief scheme for encouraging higher production in respect of certain specified commodity groups."
2205,1983-84,I propose not only to continue the scheme but also enhance the relief in duty for excess clearances.
2206,1983-84,"Under the existing scheme, there is, for excess clearances, a relief of 20 per cent of duty for items falling in certain duty rate groups and 10 per cent for those falling in other such groups."
2207,1983-84,I propose to provide incentive in two slabs instead of the present single slab.
2208,1983-84,I also propose to increase the present incentive of 20 per cent and 10 per cent respectively to 30 per cent and 15 per cent for the first slab of excess clearances and to 40 per cent and 20 per cent for the subsequent slab.
2209,1983-84,I am hopeful that industry would take advantage of this liberalisation and step up production.
2210,1983-84,I have also proposed a few changes which would benefit State Governments.
2211,1983-84,"The first is in relation to coated fabrics, both cotton and manmade and flocked fabrics where additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax of 5 per cent’ ad valorem is being proposed in addition to the duty on base fabrics."
2212,1983-84,This measure would net an additional revenue of Rs 3.4 crores in a full year.
2213,1983-84,The other proposal relates to sandalwood oil in respect of which all extant exemptions are being withdrawn.
2214,1983-84,The net gain from this proposal is Rs 30 lakhs in a year.
2215,1983-84,I now come to changes which do not involve any significant revenue.
2216,1983-84,"I propose a few changes in the tariff descriptions relating to iron and steel items which would align the Central Excise Tariff, as far as these items are concerned, with the Indian Customs Tariff."
2217,1983-84,The principles of classification hitherto adopted through executive instructions are being incorporated in the tariff entry itself.
2218,1983-84,The tariff entries relating to Iron and steel would be spelt out on a more scientific basis and the problems encountered in the matter of charging countervailing duty would also be reduced considerably.
2219,1983-84,"These changes would, however, be brought into effect from a subsequent date after the necessary groundwork."
2220,1983-84,"Till then, the present effective rates of duty would continue."
2221,1983-84,"Lest this litany of measures give the impression that the Finance Minister’s 25 proposals only relate to raising revenue, let me add that where appropriate I have tried, as I will be announcing now, some concessions in excise duties."
2222,1983-84,Sugar is an important item in the family budget.
2223,1983-84,I propose to reduce the duty on both ‘levy’ and ‘nonlevy’ sugar.
2224,1983-84,"The present ad valorem rates are being replaced by specific rates, that is 38 paise per kilogram on ‘levy’ sugar and 50 paise per kilogram on ‘nonlevy’ sugar."
2225,1983-84,The revenue sacrifice will be of the order of Rs 21.02 crores in a full year.
2226,1983-84,"I have, however, taken special care to see that the amount due to the States from additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax on sugar is not affected."
2227,1983-84,"Housewives in India, as elsewhere, have been complaining for some time about the rise in their expenses."
2228,1983-84,"As a measure of economising on their fuel bills without affecting the nutritional and, hopefully, the gastronomic value of what they cook, I propose to exempt totally pressure cookers from excise duties."
2229,1983-84,They would now find someone else in their kitchens letting off steam.
2230,1983-84,"With the same intention of promoting fuel economy, I propose also to exempt fully from excise duty fuel efficient kerosene stoves."
2231,1983-84,The effective basic rates of excise duty on electric bulbs upto 60 watts and fluorescent tubes are now 10 per cent ad valorem and 30 per cent ad valorem respectively.
2232,1983-84,"As a measure to reduce the prices of these items, and thus help in the effort to shed more light at lesser cost, I propose to exempt fully the former from excise and reduce the basic duty on the latter from 30 per cent to 20 per cent ad valorem."
2233,1983-84,"Inconsiderationofthepotentialofmultiaxledvehiclesforfuelsaving, I propose to reduce the effective basic duty on them from 15 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem."
2234,1983-84,"For the benefit of farmers, who use these fertilizers, I propose to fully exempt ammonium sulphate and calcium ammonium nitrate from excise duty, as also agricultural grade pyrites used for reclamation of alkaline soils."
2235,1983-84,"Aluminium pipes used in sprinkler equipment for irrigation, which at present bear a basic duty of 16 per cent ad valorem, will also be fully exempted."
2236,1983-84,"Another proposal is for exemption from excise duty of internal combustion engines for agricultural sprayers, and also for powered cycles."
2237,1983-84,"One of the factors leading to higher prices of prepared or preserved foods, and food products is the cost of the metal containers used in their packaging."
2238,1983-84,I propose to exempt these items from that part of excise duty as is relatable to the cost of such containers.
2239,1983-84,This should bring about a reduction in the price of these foods to the consumer.
2240,1983-84,Skimmed milk powder sold in packs upto 1 kilogram is also being fully exempted from duty as a measure to reduce its prices to consumers.
2241,1983-84,I also propose to fully exempt from duty several specified items of hospital furniture which should reduce the cost of acquiring them for the hospitals.
2242,1983-84,These excise duty concessions would cost the exchequer Rs 35.02 crores in a full year.
2243,1983-84,There are some other proposals in respect of customs and excise duties which are relatively minor.
2244,1983-84,I do not wish to take the time of the House over them.
2245,1983-84,The proposals I have presented will yield revenue of Rs 409.00 crores in a fun year in Central excise duties and Rs 397.96 crores in customs duties.
2246,1983-84,The concessions and reliefs amount to Rs 83.58 crores on the Central excise side and Rs 4.93 crores on the customs side.
2247,1983-84,"The net yield is, therefore, Rs 325.42 crores from Central excise duties and Rs 393.03 crores from customs duties."
2248,1983-84,The accrual to the Central Exchequer in a full year will be Rs 589.71 crores and the share of the States will be Rs 128.74 crores.
2249,1983-84,"Where the changes are to be made by notifications effective from 1st March, 1983, copies thereof will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
2250,1983-84,"In framing the Budget proposals, I have been greatly helped by the observations and recommendations in reports of Parliamentary Committees and also the reports made so far by the Economic Administration Reforms Commission."
2251,1983-84,"My proposals reflect these recommendations, wherever feasible and appropriate, but I must add that it has not been possible for the Government to take decisions finally on all the recommendations in the reports."
2252,1983-84,"A number of them on important matters, such as a Tribunal for valuation of urban properties, will be processed for a Direct Taxes Amendment Bill, the preparation of which will be taken in hand."
2253,1983-84,"This year I have not much to say on behalf of my Hon’ble colleague, the Minister of Communications as he has already taken care of himself."
2254,1983-84,The postal services are being expanded every year to reach more and more people.
2255,1983-84,"Presently there are over 1,41,000 post offices, and an employee strength of about 5.8 lakhs including extra departmental staff."
2256,1983-84,"With a view to meeting part of the increasing operating costs, it has become necessary to revise the postal tariff."
2257,1983-84,"While I do not propose to touch postcards and lettercards, the tariff in respect of parcels is proposed to be increased to yield Rs 12 crores in a full year and Rs 10 crores in 198384."
2258,1983-84,A Memorandum showing the proposed tariff is being circulated along with the Budget documents.
2259,1983-84,The changes will take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed by Parliament.
2260,1983-84,I had earlier mentioned that the budgetary deficit at the existing rates of taxation would be Rs 2250 crores.
2261,1983-84,"The proposed tax measures, taken together with the reliefs and concessions, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 615.31 crores to the Centre and Rs 100.74 crores to the States during 198384."
2262,1983-84,"Besides, I am 27 taking credit for Rs 135 crores as receipts from the new Bond to be issued in terms of the approved investments to obtain exemption from capital gains tax."
2263,1983-84,"After setting off the receipt of Rs 55 crores from the existing National Rural Development Bonds already included in the Budget, the net yield on this account would be Rs 80 crores."
2264,1983-84,The budgetary deficit would thus get reduced to Rs 1555 crores which Hon’ble Members would agree would not put undue strain on the economy.
2265,1983-84,"Mr. Speaker, there are no easy answers or shortcuts to development problems faced by India."
2266,1983-84,"Whether we, as a nation, succeed or fail must ultimately depend on the quality of our economic management and the cooperation of our people."
2267,1983-84,"It is true that we have been able to maintain price stability despite a setback in agriculture in the current year, increase our national income by about 5 per cent per annum in the last three years and show some improvement in our balance of payments despite an unfavourable international environment."
2268,1983-84,The road ahead is long and arduous.
2269,1983-84,"Given the resilience and dedication of our people, we can face the future with hope and confidence."
2270,1983-84,"Sir, I now commend the Budget to the House."
2271,1984-85,"The Budget has been formulated against the background of strong recovery in national income and agriculture, and an equally impressive improvement in our balance of payments."
2272,1984-85,"These and other developments in the economy have been covered in detail in the Economic Survey, presented to the House a couple of days ago."
2273,1984-85,"I shall, therefore, be brief in reviewing the current economic situation."
2274,1984-85,"As the House is aware, the country had to go through two years of severe drought and one year of indifferent monsoon during the period 197980 to 198283."
2275,1984-85,"Foodgrains production, which had reached 132 million tonnes in 197879, declined to 110 million tonnes in the following year."
2276,1984-85,It recovered to 133 million tonnes in 1981 82
2277,1984-85,"The current year has seen a major breakthrough in foodgrains production, and we are not only likely to recover lost ground, but also improve substantially on the previous peak."
2278,1984-85,Foodgrains production in 198384 is expected to exceed the target of 142 million tonnes.
2279,1984-85,Agricultural production as a whole is likely to increase by 9 per cent over the previous year.
2280,1984-85,Honourable Members will agree that this is convincing testimony to the soundness of our agricultural strategy and to the hard work of our farmers.
2281,1984-85,"Industrial growth in the current year is likely to be about 4.5 per cent, compared with 3.9 per cent in 198283."
2282,1984-85,"For the four year period after 197980, industrial growth will average slightly more than 5 per cent."
2283,1984-85,This is well below the potential of the industrial sector.
2284,1984-85,We must aim at a growth rate of 7 to 8 per cent in industry if we are to maintain highrate of growth of CDP and provide employment for our growing labour force in the years ahead.
2285,1984-85,The national income growth in 198384 is likely to be in the range of 6 to 7 per cent.
2286,1984-85,"In the four years since the present Government took over, the average growth rate in national income has been about 5.4 per cent which is higher than the rate of growth in the first four years of any previous Plan."
2287,1984-85,Per capita income in this period will have risen at an average rate exceeding 3 per cent per year.
2288,1984-85,"This achievement is all the more noteworthy when viewed against the background of a highly adverse international economic environment, anda severe drought."
2289,1984-85,The years 198182 and 198283 were characterised by exceptionally low rates of inflation.
2290,1984-85,The annual rate of inflation which had reached a high of 21.4 per cent in 197980 was brought down to 16.7 per cent in 198081 and further to only 2.4 per cent at the end of 198182.
2291,1984-85,"The annual rate of inflation at the end of 198283 was 6.2 per cent, which is unusually low for a drought year."
2292,1984-85,"But, there has been acceleration in the annual rate of inflation in the current year despite an excellent crop."
2293,1984-85,The initial delay in the arrival of the monsoon and the high liquidity in the economy exerted pressure on prices in the early part of the year.
2294,1984-85,The favourable effects of a good crop led to a decline in cereal prices after harvesting.
2295,1984-85,"However, this was largely offset by sharp increases in prices of a few commodities such as pulses, certain edible oils, rubber, tea and cotton because of both domestic and international factors."
2296,1984-85,"As a result, the seasonal dip in prices, which normally occurs towards the end of September has been weak."
2297,1984-85,"As the House is aware, the Government has taken several measures to minimise the impact of the drought and to contain the price rise."
2298,1984-85,"Action was taken to increase procurement, availability, and releases of sensitive commodities such as wheat, sugar, and edible oils through the public distribution system."
2299,1984-85,Steps were also taken to mop up excess liquidity with the banking system and to curtail Government expenditure.
2300,1984-85,Exports of cotton and CTC teas were restrained in order to increase domestic availability.
2301,1984-85,"Further measures will be taken as required to ensure that there is no repetition of the experience of 197980, when prices were allowed to increase by over 21 per cent."
2302,1984-85,"In my budget speech last year, I had informed the House of the improvement that had taken place in our balance of payments in 198283."
2303,1984-85,I am happy to say that this improvement has gained strength in 198384.
2304,1984-85,"The trade gap, which declined from Rs 5800 crores in 198182 to about Rs 5500 crores in i98283, is expected to decline further in the current year."
2305,1984-85,Receipts on invisibles account have remained buoyant and the incentives for nonresident deposits have been highly successful.
2306,1984-85,"Our foreign exchange reserves, Inclusive of IMF drawings, have increased by Rs 662 crores in the current financial year upto 10th February."
2307,1984-85,"Our strategy for bringing the balance of payments under control, after the sharp deterioration that occurred in 197980, has paid rich dividends."
2308,1984-85,"In view of the improvement in our payments position, the Government has voluntarily decided not to avail of the balance of 1.1 billion SDR under the Extended Fund Facility of the IMF."
2309,1984-85,"While intervening in the debate on the IMF loan in this House in December, 1981, the Prime Minister had this to say, and I quote: “It does not force us to borrow, nor shall we borrow unless it is in the national interest."
2310,1984-85,"There is absolutely no question of our accepting any programme which is incompatible with our policy, declared and accepted 2 by Parliament."
2311,1984-85,It is inconceivable that anybody should think that we would accept assistance from any external agency which dictates terms which are not in consonance with such policies.
2312,1984-85,"This was true then, and it is true now."
2313,1984-85,"Belying the prophecies of doom by many a self styled Cassandra, the economy has emerged stronger as a result of the adjustment effort mounted by us."
2314,1984-85,None of the dire consequences that we were being warned about has occurred.
2315,1984-85,We have not cut subsidies.
2316,1984-85,We have not cut wages.
2317,1984-85,We have not compromised on Planning.
2318,1984-85,We have not been trapped in a debt crisis.
2319,1984-85,We have not faltered in our commitment to antipoverty programmes or the welfare of our people.
2320,1984-85,We entered into this loan arrangement with our eyes open.
2321,1984-85,We have come out of it with our heads high.
2322,1984-85,"We hope that our decision to forgo the balance of the amount available to us under the IMF loan would, in a small way, help the IMF to provide greater assistance to other developing countries."
2323,1984-85,I must also take this opportunity to express our appreciation for the goodwill and mutualunderstanding that has marked our relationship with the IMF during the entire period of the EFF arrangement.
2324,1984-85,"However, there can be no room for complacency."
2325,1984-85,We must persist with the policies that have brought about this favourable outcome.
2326,1984-85,It is necessary to work even harder to save imports in critical areas and to increase exports.
2327,1984-85,"Our exports, net of oil, in the first seven months of 198384 increased by 9.9 per cent."
2328,1984-85,This is a reasonable performance considering that world trade has been stagnant for quite some time.
2329,1984-85,"We would need to do even better in the future in order to meet the essential import requirements of a growing economy, and to keep the debt service ratio at a manageable level."
2330,1984-85,The Government has taken several steps in the last four years to mobilise resources for public sector investment and to increase the rate of public savings for financing the Plan.
2331,1984-85,"Apart from adjustment of the tax rates, the fiscal instrument has been used to provide stronger incentives for savings in the form of financial assets."
2332,1984-85,Interest rates on deposits were also revised upwards with the same objective in view.
2333,1984-85,These policies have been highly successful and the inflow of funds in small savings as well as time deposits has exceeded expectations.
2334,1984-85,An important task of fiscal policy in the years ahead is to strengthen this trend.
2335,1984-85,"In considering the strategy for resource mobilisation we have to recognise that while our tax rates are relatively high, the tax base is narrow."
2336,1984-85,The evils of black money and tax evasion also have to be reckoned with.
2337,1984-85,The Government is fully committed to come down heavily on tax evaders.
2338,1984-85,"At the same time, we must ensure that, as far as possible, the tax system itself does not become a source of encouragement for evasion."
2339,1984-85,"Simplification and rationalisation of the tax system must, therefore, remain important objectives of our fiscal policy."
2340,1984-85,The Central public sector enterprises had shown a net profit of Rs 618 crores in 198283.
2341,1984-85,"Although a large number of public sector enterprises have continued to show profits in 198384, their overall performance has been below expectations."
2342,1984-85,"The erosion of profitability was largely due to losses incurred in a few sectors, such as steel and coal."
2343,1984-85,The Government has taken steps to improve their functioning.
2344,1984-85,We must ensure that capital is used more efficiently so that larger resources are available for future expansion.
2345,1984-85,"In order to fulfil our social commitments and protect jobs, Government had to take over a large number of sick units and sustain them through injection of fresh resources."
2346,1984-85,"While some of them have turned the corner, a large number of them continue to incur losses."
2347,1984-85,The time has come to undertake a careful review of the performance of sick units in the public sector with a view to reducing the drain on our resources.
2348,1984-85,This Government proposes to do.
2349,1984-85,Economic viability must be the principal test for the survival of an enterprise.
2350,1984-85,The growth of deposits with the banking system in the current year has substantially exceeded their requirements of funds for credit expansion.
2351,1984-85,"This has, in the short run, resulted in some excess liquidity with the banking system."
2352,1984-85,"In this situation, and in order to mobilise some resources for public investment, it is considered desirable to introduce another financial instrument with broadly the same characteristics as longer term time deposits with banks."
2353,1984-85,"Under the scheme, which will be called the “National Deposit Scheme”, certificates of deposits with a maturity of four years can be purchased from designated outlets."
2354,1984-85,The investor will have the option to encash these deposits any time after one year.
2355,1984-85,"The interest rate will be 10.5 per cent if these deposits are held for four years, and 10, 9 and 7 per cent if these are held for three, two and one year respectively."
2356,1984-85,"Interest from these deposits will be eligible for tax exemption upto the full limit of Rs 10,000/ under Section 80L of the Incometax Act."
2357,1984-85,The target of receipts under this scheme is Rs 500 crores over a period of time.
2358,1984-85,"I should clarify that this is a temporary scheme, and will be discontinued after this target is reached or earlier, if monetary developments so warrant."
2359,1984-85,"Pursuant to the recommendations of the High Level Committee on financial institutions set up by the Government last year, it has been decided to make certain changes in the “convertibility clause”."
2360,1984-85,"In view of the increases in capital costs of projects and the investment limit for the delicensed sector, the threshold for exemption from convertibility clause is being raised from the existing level of Rs 1 crore to Rs 5 crores."
2361,1984-85,"Further, in the case of nonMRTP companies, convertibility clause will not be stipulated where the holding of equity by all financial institutions in such a company exceeds 26 per cent."
2362,1984-85,"In the case of M11TP companies/large houses, however, the existing limit of 40 per cent will continue."
2363,1984-85,In order to encourage investment in “No Industry” districts there will be complete exemption from convertibility clause in 4 respect of units proposed to be located in these districts.

2372,1984-85,The response has been generally favourable.
2373,1984-85,"In order to examine suggestions received from State Governments as well as trade and industry, and to work out the modalities for effecting a change in the financial year, I propose to set up an expert committee, which would include representatives of Central Government, State Governments, Reserve Bank of India, Comptroller and Auditor General and some nonofficial members."
2374,1984-85,"This committee will be requested to submit its report by the end of September, 1984."
2375,1984-85,I shall now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198384 and the Budget Estimates for 198485.

2380,1984-85,"The Central Plan outlay in 198384 is now estimated at Rs 14,059 crores."
2381,1984-85,"This has been made possible by an increase in the budgetary support by Rs 1,007 crores over the Budget Estimates."

2388,1984-85,Rupees 100 crores have been set apart for the new rural landless employment guarantee programme launched during the current year.

2408,1984-85,Revised Estimates also include additional provision of Rs 502 crores for subscription towards our higher quota in the IMF.

2423,1984-85,"Total receipts are thus estimated to go up from Rs 33,250 crores to Rs 36,929 crores."

2425,1984-85,This excludes the special loan assistance of Rs 400 crores provided to States for clearing their overdrafts at the end of the previous year 198283.
2426,1984-85,"I am sure the House will agree that despite unavoidable budgetary pressures, we have been able to keep the deficit within prudent limits."
2427,1984-85,BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 198485 35.
2428,1984-85,"Honourable Members will recall that when our Government took office in January 1980, an important task before us was to revitalise the planning process and to give a new thrust to the programmes of development."
2429,1984-85,"I am happy to say that, in the last four years, we have been able to achieve an unprecedented increase in the tempo of public investment."
2430,1984-85,"For 198485, the approved Plan outlay of the Centre, States and Union territories will be Rs 30,132 crores as compared to Rs 25,480 crores in 198384."
2431,1984-85,"The 7 Central Plan outlay for 198485 is Rs 17,351 crores, which represents a step up of 25 per cent over the approved Plan outlay of Rs 13,870 crores in 198384."
2432,1984-85,"The Plan outlay for the States and Union territories is placed at Rs 12,78l crores as compared with the final approved outlay of Rs 11,678 crores in 198384."
2433,1984-85,"Central assistance for the Plans of States and Union territories will be Rs 5050 crores as against Rs 4462 crores in 198384 Budget Estimates, representing an increase of 13.2 per cent over the allocation made for the current year."
2434,1984-85,"Within this aggregate, Plans of individual States show a varied picture."
2435,1984-85,"Some States have managed their finances well; they have been able to raise additional resources and effectively utilise these to implement adequately sized Plans, providing development and growth to their people."
2436,1984-85,"Unfortunately, some States, for reasons of their own, have used their resources for various other purposes; they have not invested their resources, including additional resources mobilised, for development and have also resorted to large overdrafts on the RBI."
2437,1984-85,"With a view to assisting even such States, various facilities and opportunities were provided from time to time."
2438,1984-85,"At the beginning of the Sixth Plan itself, recovery of outstanding advance assistance amounting to Rs 1412 crores was postponed."
2439,1984-85,This was done to enable States to start with a clean slate.
2440,1984-85,"However, State overdrafts again grew, and in June 1982, I decided to clear States’ closing deficits of the previous year with a medium term loan of Rs 1743 crores."
2441,1984-85,RBI also doubled the ways and means limits available to the States.
2442,1984-85,"Again last year, while presenting the budget, I announced an increased level of Central assistance."
2443,1984-85,All these measures were taken primarily to assist States to readjust their financial affairs and to be able to implement State Plans of adequate size.
2444,1984-85,"Unfortunately, despite these measures, some States continued to rely heavily on overdrafts even after March 1982."
2445,1984-85,"Their proposed deficits at the end of March 1984 would have harshly affected their Plan sizes if these deficits were adjusted against next year’ s Plan, as per normal practice."
2446,1984-85,"In considering the ways of overcoming this problem, I have found myself in a predicament."
2447,1984-85,"On the one hand, no Finance Minister of the country can remain unconcerned about the size of a State’s Plan."
2448,1984-85,"On the other hand, if assistance is extended to defaulting States, the wellmanaged States can legitimately complain that they have not got their just rewards from the Centre for their better performance."
2449,1984-85,"In the past few weeks, discussions were again held with the Chief Ministers of States whose overdrafts with the RBI were high."
2450,1984-85,Several State Governments have agreed to take the necessary measures to improve their financial position and to reduce their reliance on overdrafts.
2451,1984-85,"On my part, I have agreed to take further steps to provide additional assistance to States in order to protect their Plans as far as possible."
2452,1984-85,"In doing so, I have been particularly conscious of the need to keep up the momentum of antipoverty programmes."
2453,1984-85,Central assistance is also being further increased.
2454,1984-85,"With 8 this, the aggregate assistance during the Plan period will amount to Rs 17,790 crores as against Rs 15,350 crores envisaged in the Plan document."
2455,1984-85,"Further, as I mentioned earlier, I have made an additional provision of Rs 500 crores in the Revised Estimates for 198384."
2456,1984-85,This special assistance would enable these States to clear part of their overdrafts with the RBI.
2457,1984-85,"States have also been informed that closing deficits, upto the permissible ways and means limits from the RBI, will not be adjusted from next year’s Plan resources."
2458,1984-85,"For those States who have managed their finances well, I am working out a suitable scheme to provide some additional assistance to them in 198485."
2459,1984-85,This is only just and appropriate.
2460,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure that the House will agree with me that, despite severe resource constraints of its own, the Central Government has done the maximum that it can to solve the States’ problems."
2461,1984-85,"The rest, however, is upto them."
2462,1984-85,"Altogether, in the Sixth Plan period, the public sector Plan at current prices will be over Rs 110,000 crores."
2463,1984-85,"This compares with Plan expenditure of Es.46,700 crores in the preceding five years, which of course, include three years of “nonPlan” launched by the previous Government."
2464,1984-85,"In real terms too, the Sixth Plan will constitute a massive increase over the outlays provided for in any previous Plan."
2465,1984-85,"This, Mr. Speaker, is the measure of achievement of this Government in accelerating the pace of development in the current Plan period."
2466,1984-85,"In the last four years, the present Government introduced a number of schemes for the benefit of the weaker sections of the society, particularly in the rural areas."
2467,1984-85,"These include the Integrated Rural Development Programme, the National Rural Employment Programme and the two new programmes announced by the Prime Minister on 15th August, 1983, namely, the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme and the scheme for providing selfemployment opportunities to the educated unemployed."
2468,1984-85,"Each of these programmes is designed to create opportunities for employment and income generation for particular target groups, while also creating productive assets."
2469,1984-85,In formulating the next year’s Plan we have provided the maximum support to these and other programmes that benefit the rural poor directly.
2470,1984-85,"The total allocation for various programmes of the Ministry of Rural Development would be Rs 932 crores, which is nearly double the amount of Rs 480 crores provided in 198384."
2471,1984-85,"For the IRDP an allocation of Rs 216 crores is being provided, which is to be matched by the States."
2472,1984-85,The number of beneficiaries under the programme in 198485 is estimated at over 3 million.
2473,1984-85,"For the NREP, the outlay for 198485 is Rs 230 crores, which will again be matched by the States."
2474,1984-85,"The allocation for Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme, which seeks to provide employment for 100 days in a year to at least one member of 9 every rural landless family, is being stepped up to Rs 400 crores in 198485 as against a provision of Rs 100 crores in 198384."
2475,1984-85,"This, together with the NREP, will provide 550 million mandays of work in rural areas in 198485."
2476,1984-85,An allocation of Rs 25 crores is being made for the programme for providing selfemployment opportunities to the educated unemployed.
2477,1984-85,"As the House is aware, the budgetary provision under this programme will be used as capital subsidy against loans to be given by banks."
2478,1984-85,"I may add that for these two new programmes, depending on the progress of expenditure, more funds will be provided during the course of the year as necessary."
2479,1984-85,"In the Plan for 198485, Rs 243 crores have been earmarked for the accelerated rural water supply programme."
2480,1984-85,The States on their part are expected to provide Rs 364 crores for this purpose under the minimum needs programme.
2481,1984-85,"Over 50,000 problem villages are expected to be provided with drinking water facilities during 198485."
2482,1984-85,"The programme for integrated child development services is an important part of our efforts to help women and children in the backward areas, urban slums and tribal areas of our country."
2483,1984-85,This programme is already in operation in 820 blocks.
2484,1984-85,"By the end of 1984, the scheme will become fully operational in an 1000 identified blocks."
2485,1984-85,A provision of Rs 36 crores has been made for this scheme.
2486,1984-85,A total allocation of Rs 78 crores is being provided for various schemes of the Department of Social Welfare in 198485.
2487,1984-85,The provision in the Central Plan for the various programmes benefiting the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and other backward classes has been increased to Rs 209 crores in 198485 compared to Rs 176 crores only in 198384.
2488,1984-85,Plan outlay for the programmes in education and culture has been substantially stepped up to Rs 204 crores in 198485 as against Rs 155 crores in 198384.
2489,1984-85,"Likewise, the Plan outlay for health and family welfare programmes has also been stepped up by nearly 32 per cent from Rs 460 crores in 1983 84 to Rs 605 crores in 198485."
2490,1984-85,The family welfare programmes will cover an additional 20 million persons.
2491,1984-85,These and other socioeconomic priorities of the Government are reflected in the 20Point Programme which is being vigorously implemented.
2492,1984-85,"The total amount allocated to the Programme in the Central Plan is Rs 4038 crores, which is an increase of about 47 per cent over the current year’s provision."
2493,1984-85,"Inclusive of the outlays to be provided by the States and Union territories, the total provision for the 20Point Programme will be Rs 11,858 crores, representing nearly 40 per cent of the total annual Plan outlay of the Centre, States and Union territories."
2494,1984-85,An important source of strength for the economy has been the tremendous strides made in the agricultural sector.
2495,1984-85,The next year’s Plan will continue the high priority given by the present Government to the development of this sector.
2496,1984-85,"Thus, the total outlay for the various programmes of the Ministry of Agriculture will be Rs 758 crores compared to Rs 556 crores in the current financial year."
2497,1984-85,"The outlay includes 10 Rs 38 crores for the National Oilseeds Development: Project which together with the ongoing programmes, visualises an additional production of 9.4 lakh tonnes during 198485 itself."

2499,1984-85,"The total provision for various power projects adds to Rs 1764 crores, which represents a 44 per cent increase over 198384."

2508,1984-85,"Higher allocations have been provided for steel, nonferrous metals, paper, cement and several other sectors, which are important for country’s industrial development."
2509,1984-85,"I would also like to draw the attention of the House to the programmes for the development of science and technology, conservation of natural resources, and improvement of the environment in the Plan for 198485."
2510,1984-85,"The successful positioning of INSATIB in a geocentric orbit in August last, testifies to the excellent work done by our scientists, engineers and technicians."
2511,1984-85,It is also a matter of pride to us that India has joined a select group of countries which have permanent scientific stations in the Antarctica.
2512,1984-85,"India has also achieved the distinction of being the only developing country to be given the status of ‘pioneer investor’ by the Convention on the Law of the Sea, giving us the right to exploit the mineral resources of the deep sea beds."
2513,1984-85,"Finally, I should mention that the incentive schemes for better performance in selected areas, initiated in 198384, will continue in 198485 also."
2514,1984-85,"As the House is aware, these schemes are designed to improve the functioning of the electricity boards, and provide further impetus to the programmes for small and marginal farmers, rural water supply schemes, environmental improvement in urban slums, construction of field channels in command area development projects, and adult education for women and elementary education for girls."
2515,1984-85,A lumpsum provision of Rs 200 crores is being made for this purpose.
2516,1984-85,"Lest the Honourable Members take me to be a magician, who can do so much with so little, I hasten to clarify that the incentive scheme is designed 11 to provide additional resources linked to performance for specified schemes."
2517,1984-85,"There are, of course, also separate substantial allocations for each of these schemes."
2518,1984-85,I have only briefly touched upon the main priorities and objectives of the Annual Plan for 198485.
2519,1984-85,Further details are available in the budget documents.
2520,1984-85,"In order to provide the maximum possible outlay for the Plan, I have taken special care to ensure that nonPlan expenditure is kept at the minimum."
2521,1984-85,"However, certain increases are necessary and unavoidable."
2522,1984-85,I should also add that the estimates of receipts from and payments to State Governments take into account the recommendations contained in the interim report of the Eighth Finance Commission.
2523,1984-85,I have already kept the House informed of this.
2524,1984-85,"The final report of the Commission is now expected by the end of April, 1984."
2525,1984-85,I have provided Rs 6800 crores for Defence expenditure next year against the Revised Estimates of Rs 6350 crores.

2535,1984-85,"The States’ share of taxes in 198485 is estimated at Rs 5739 crores as against Rs 5246 crores in the current year, which is an increase of nearly Rs 500 crores."

2537,1984-85,The dividend from Railways and Posts and Telegraphs will be higher by Rs 106 crores than the Revised Estimates for 198384.
2538,1984-85,Interest receipts and repayment of loans by public sector undertakings and State Governments will also be higher.
2539,1984-85,Receipts from market loans are placed at Rs 4100 crores against Rs 4000 crores in the current year.
2540,1984-85,Small savings collections are estimated at Rs 2400 crores against Rs 2200 crores in the current year.
2541,1984-85,External assistance net of repayments is estimated at Rs 2089 crores compared with Rs 1902 crores.
2542,1984-85,Next year’s Budget also includes a receipt of Rs 200 crores from the National Deposit Scheme to which I have 12 referred in the earlier part of my speech.
2543,1984-85,"Taking into account these and other variations in receipts, the total receipts in 198485 are estimated at Rs 40,501 crores."
2544,1984-85,These receipts include the effect of the changes in fare and freight rates of the Railways.
2545,1984-85,"The total expenditure is placed at Rs 42,536 crores."
2546,1984-85,The overall budgetary gap at existing rates of taxation will thus be Rs 2035 crores.
2547,1984-85,I have taxed the patience of the House enough.
2548,1984-85,Let me now turn to other tax proposals.
2549,1984-85,"In framing these proposals, I have tried to take into account the realities of the economic situation to which I referred at the beginning of my speech."
2550,1984-85,"While doing so, I hope I have not been entirely unmindful of a certain forthcoming event which is of importance to all of us in this Parliament."
2551,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, my first proposal relates to the noncorporate income tax sector."
2552,1984-85,I propose to revise substantially the entire rate structure relating to personal taxation.
2553,1984-85,"The present rate of tax in the first slab of taxable income ranging from Rs 15,001 to Rs 20,000 is 25 per cent."
2554,1984-85,The House will recall that this rate was brought down last year from the then prevailing level of 30 per cent.
2555,1984-85,I now propose to reduce this rate further to 20 per cent.
2556,1984-85,"Relief has been allowed at all income levels above Rs 20,000 also."
2557,1984-85,The maximum marginal rate of tax on incomes over Rs 1 lakh is being reduced from 60 per cent to 55 per cent.
2558,1984-85,"The new rates in some illustrative slabs will be as follows: in the income slab of Rs 25,001 to Rs 30,000, the new rate will be 30 per cent as against 35 per cent at present; in the income slab of Rs 50,001 to Rs 60,000, the new rate will be 45 per cent as against 50 per cent at present; and in the income slab of Rs 70,001 to Rs 80,000 the new rate will be 50 per cent as against 55 per cent at present."
2559,1984-85,The above proposal will provide relief at all levels of incomes.
2560,1984-85,"Taken with the increase in the standard deduction introduced last year, I expect this measure will provide substantial relief in particular to the fixed income groups."
2561,1984-85,"The revised tax schedule will provide a relief in tax of Rs 281/ to a taxpayer with an income of Rs 20,000, which is 20 per cent of the tax payable by him earlier."
2562,1984-85,"For an income level of Rs 30,000, the relief will be Rs 844/ or 16.67 per cent of the tax payable under the old structure, and at income level of Rs 50,000, this relief will be 10 per cent of the tax payable."
2563,1984-85,"The loss of revenue in the proposed rate schedule, assuming no change in the number of taxpayers and the assessed incomes in different income slabs, is calculated at Rs 180 crores."
2564,1984-85,"However, lowering of the tax rates should normally be expected to lead to an increase in the coverage of taxpayers in different tax slabs and also better tax compliance."
2565,1984-85,"Taking these factors into account, I have assumed a net 13 revenue loss of Rs 59 crores only."
2566,1984-85,This loss is entirely attributable to tax relief provided to the fixed income groups.
2567,1984-85,"As far as business and professional incomes are concerned, I have assumed that the reduction in the rates will encourage better compliance and reporting and that this will partly cover the revenue loss."
2568,1984-85,"This proposal, Mr. Speaker, Sir, in a way continues the tax rationalisation programme that was started by my Party in 1974; carried forward in 1976 and further reinforced after we came back to power in 1980."
2569,1984-85,The present tax structure has also been brought down to a level which I regard as realistic and entirely appropriate.
2570,1984-85,I hope this measure will have a salutary effect on our tax culture and will induce the maximum number of taxpayers to come forward and voluntarily declare their true incomes.
2571,1984-85,"At the same time, it is necessary to simplify tax administration and make it more responsive to the needs of the taxpayers."
2572,1984-85,One essential feature would be the effort to complete assessments within the shortest possible time.
2573,1984-85,"As the Hon’ble Members are aware, the scope of the summary assessment scheme covers incomes upto Rs 1 lakh."
2574,1984-85,"Only a percentage of cases with incomes in this range is being scrutinised, the selection of such cases being on random sampling basis."
2575,1984-85,The target for 198384 is to complete 85 per cent of the summary assessments workload.
2576,1984-85,I have instructed the Income Tax Department to further speed up the assessments.
2577,1984-85,"For some years, the Incometax Act has contained provisions empowering the Central Government to acquire immovable property having a fair market value exceeding Rs 25,000."
2578,1984-85,This power is exercisable in situations where the declared consideration for transfer of the property is less than the fair market value of the property.
2579,1984-85,"To eliminate unproductive work in handling a large number of relatively small value cases and also taking into account the rise in market prices I have modified the provision to say that this power will be exercised only in cases where the fair market value exceeds Rs 50,000."
2580,1984-85,"As a further simplification it is being provided that the prescribed statement will have to be filed before the registering officer only in cases where the value of consideration for the transfer exceeds Rs 25,000 as against Rs 10,000 at present."
2581,1984-85,"With the reduction in rates and expeditious disposal of assessments, I believe there can now be no excuse for any leniency to be shown to those who abuse our laws."
2582,1984-85,Such cases will necessarily have to be dealt with severely.
2583,1984-85,"In order to discourage tax avoidance and tax evasion, I am also introducing some further measures."
2584,1984-85,"In all cases where the annual turnover exceeds Rs 20 lakhs or where the gross receipts from a profession exceed Rs 10 lakhs, I am providing for a compulsory audit of accounts."
2585,1984-85,This is intended to ensure that the books of account and other records are properly maintained and faithfully reflect the true income of the taxpayer.
2586,1984-85,"I am also proposing that loans or deposits of Rs 10,000 or more shall be taken or accepted only by crossed cheque or bank draft."
2587,1984-85,I find that the existing provisions of the Incometax Act provide that no suit to enforce any right relating to any property held benami can be instituted in any court by a person claiming to be the legal owner unless he has declared the Income from such property in any return of income or the value of such property in any return of net wealth or furnished a notice in this behalf in the prescribed form to the Income tax Officer.
2588,1984-85,Such return or notice can at present be given at any time before the suit is filed.
2589,1984-85,With a view to curbing the practice of benami holding of property I am proposing that it will henceforth be obligatory in all cases to give notice to the Commissioner of Incometax in the prescribed form within one year of the acquisition of the property.
2590,1984-85,This amendment will enable the Department to initiate appropriate action in respect of such benami acquisition of property well before the limitation for such action expires.
2591,1984-85,"Having dealt with the noncorporate sector, I now turn my attention to the corporate sector."
2592,1984-85,The tax rates for this sector are not being changed.
2593,1984-85,I am however providing one facility.
2594,1984-85,"Last year, while raising the surcharge payable by companies from 2.5 per cent to 5 per cent, I had given companies the option to make deposits of the additional surcharge with the Industrial Development Bank of India."
2595,1984-85,I am now further providing that companies can henceforth exercise this option in respect of the entire amount of the surcharge payable by them.
2596,1984-85,"These resources will flow back to the corporate sector, and will be available for modernisation."
2597,1984-85,"In the earlier part of my speech, I have already referred to the decision to reduce the interest rates on loans upto Rs 4 crores being extended by IDBI under the soft loan scheme."
2598,1984-85,Representations had been received from various quarters that the ceiling on the deductible amount of managerial remuneration as contained in the Incometax Act is low and should be raised.
2599,1984-85,"I am glad to inform the House that having regard to the changes in the managerial remuneration introduced by the Department of Company Affairs, I am also raising the ceiling limits for managerial salaries from Rs 5,000 to Rs 7,500 per month."
2600,1984-85,The ceiling in respect of perquisites will however remain unchanged.
2601,1984-85,"Some relaxations are also being provided to those engaged in the business of growing, and manufacturing tea."
2602,1984-85,The existing provisions provide exemption from tax only in respect of subsidy received for replantation or replacement of tea bushes.
2603,1984-85,I am extending this tax exemption to cover subsidy received for other approved schemes relating to rejuvenation and consolidation of areas.
2604,1984-85,I hope this measure will further lend support to our scheme for increasing production of tea.
2605,1984-85,"My next proposal, I believe, will be welcomed by a large number of people."
2606,1984-85,"Investors presently can receive dividends and interest on debentures without deduction of tax at source, if they furnish an exemption certificate from the Income tax Officer or alternatively file a declaration to the effect that their income for the year is below the exemption limit."
2607,1984-85,"To reduce paper work and avoid inconvenience to small 15 investors, I propose to provide that widelyheld companies may, henceforth, pay interest on debentures and"
2608,1984-85,"Rs 1,000 without deduction of tax at source provided that the payment is made by an account payee cheque or a bank draft."
2609,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I notice that certain provisions of tax laws are being misused by a section of the taxpayers."
2610,1984-85,I had occasion last year to deal at some length with taxation of charitable and religious trusts and institutions.
2611,1984-85,"I find that some of these trusts and institutions are trying to circumvent the investment pattern for trust funds laid down by the Finance Act, 1983."
2612,1984-85,"It is necessary to ensure that all such trusts and institutions strictly conform to the prescribed investment pattern and that such income or property is not used for providing benefit to the settlors, trustees, etc."
2613,1984-85,"I, therefore, propose to provide for taxation of the Income of defaulting trusts and institutions at the maximum marginal rate of incometax."
2614,1984-85,"While on this subject, I would like to refer to a tendency noticed to create private trusts which carry on business."
2615,1984-85,"To curb such practice, I propose to provide that where such trusts have profits and gains of business, the entire income of the trust will be charged to tax at the maximum marginal rate, an exception being made only in the cases where the trust is created by will for dependent relatives."
2616,1984-85,Another undesirable practice noticed is the tendency of some corporate bodies to make large contributions to the socalled welfare funds.
2617,1984-85,I further understand that utilisation of these funds is discretionary and subject to no discipline.
2618,1984-85,"I am, therefore, providing that deductions will be available only in respect of contributions to such funds as are established under statute or an approved provident fund, superannuation fund or gratuity fund."
2619,1984-85,I am making this change with retrospective effect to avoid unnecessary litigation.
2620,1984-85,"Last year, I liberalised the scheme related to export turnover."
2621,1984-85,I propose to continue it and watch its operation for a longer period of time.
2622,1984-85,"Last year, I had also referred to a large variety of exemptions and deductions that had been built into our tax system over time."
2623,1984-85,"While each deduction by itself may have its own merits, the aggregate effect was to complicate the tax administration and to provide loopholes for tax avoidance or tax evasion, as also for litigation."
2624,1984-85,"I had, therefore, initiated a process of review and, where necessary, doing away with concessions which had outlived their utility."
2625,1984-85,I intend to carry this process further.
2626,1984-85,Our experience has shown that an expenditure related concession leads to a tendency to inflate expenditure and hence it should have no place in our tax system.
2627,1984-85,"Therefore, I propose to withdraw all weighted deductions as are available under the different provisions."
2628,1984-85,"The expenditure actually incurred will, of course, continue to qualify for deduction."
2629,1984-85,Only the benefit of weightage will no longer be available.
2630,1984-85,"I am also withdrawing the exemptions available under sections 33B, 35C, 8OCC, 80D and 80E of the Incometax Act."
2631,1984-85,"These deductions, notwithstanding their 16 apparent laudable objectives have either been open to misuse or have benefited only a few."
2632,1984-85,The revenue involved is marginal.
2633,1984-85,"I am also reducing the quantum of exemption available under Sections 80M, 8ON and 800. 84."
2634,1984-85,"Now, I intend to announce a few concessions in respect of the Wealthtax Act."
2635,1984-85,"Hon’ble Members, I am sure, will be happy to hear that the monetary ceiling of exemption in respect of one house owned by a taxpayer is being increased from the present level of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakhs."
2636,1984-85,This is being done to take into account the increase in market value.
2637,1984-85,"I am also proposing to raise the exemption limit in respect of specified financial assets from the present level of Rs 1,65,000 to Rs 2,65,000."
2638,1984-85,"Together with separate exemption of Rs 35,000 available in respect of units of the Unit Trust of India and proposed to be extended to deposits under the National Deposit Scheme, the aggregate exemption in respect of the value of specified financial assets will rise to Rs 3 lakhs as against the present ceiling of Rs 2 lakhs."
2639,1984-85,"Honourable Members would recall that in the earlier part of my speech, I had referred to the success in mobilising savings in the form of financial assets; I hope that this change will give further impetus to it."
2640,1984-85,The other changes proposed by me in respect of direct taxes are of relatively minor nature and I would not like to take the valuable time of this House by elaborating them.
2641,1984-85,"After adjustment of the gain to revenue on account of withdrawal or modification of certain concessions, my proposal in regard to Incometax will lead to a net loss of Rs 75 crores, of which the loss to the Centre would be Rs 36.32 crores and the loss of the States would be Rs 38.68 crores."
2642,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I shall now deal with my proposals in the area of indirect taxes."
2643,1984-85,Here my main objective has been to provide further impetus to the growth of Indian industry through tariff adjustments and substantial relief in excise duties in carefully selected areas.
2644,1984-85,I have also kept in view the need to reduce prices of certain items for consumers and contain the rate of inflation in the economy.
2645,1984-85,"I am sure the Honourable Members will not grudge, if in doing so, I have also taken a little care of Government revenues."
2646,1984-85,My principal proposal relating to customs duties is with regard to auxiliary duty of customs.
2647,1984-85,"The levy imposed on an annual basis since the 1973 Budget is proposed to be continued upto the 31st of March, 1985."
2648,1984-85,"I also propose to raise, with certain exceptions, the present effective rates by 5 percentage points."
2649,1984-85,"I am excluding from the proposed increase essential items like fertilizers, bulk petroleum products such as kerosene and highspeed diesel oil, and also newsprint."
2650,1984-85,Fuller details of these proposals are available in the Budget papers.
2651,1984-85,This proposal is expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 241.73 crores in a full year.
2652,1984-85,The present customs duty on crude petroleum of Rs 9.50 per metric tonne which is being collected by way of auxiliary duty was fixed in 1973.
2653,1984-85,"Without 17 affecting the domestic prices of petroleum products, I propose to raise the duty on crude to Rs 100 per metric tonne."
2654,1984-85,The revenue gain from this measure will be Rs 132.76 crores.
2655,1984-85,"This duty, increase is to be absorbed by the oil companies without their having to raise consumer prices on this account."
2656,1984-85,The current rates of Import duties on iron and steel Items were fixed a few years back and they are now out of line with the requirements of Indigenous industry.
2657,1984-85,"I propose to raise the basic customs duty on different items of iron and steel other than stainless steel by 5 percentage points or 10 percentage points, depending upon the existing rates of duties."
2658,1984-85,"I also propose to levy a total customs duty of 20 percent ad valorem on stainless steel melting scrap, which is presently exempt from customs duty."
2659,1984-85,These measures are expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 84.
2660,1984-85,"I also propose to increase the import duty on zip fasteners and parts thereof, magnetic tape and petroleum specialities, namely petroleum jelly, sodium petroleum sulfonate and liquid paraffin."
2661,1984-85,Details of the proposals are available in the Budget papers.
2662,1984-85,The revenue gain in these proposals would be of the order of Rs 5.32 crores.
2663,1984-85,"In order to promote exports in the important sector of gems and jewellery, customs duties leviable on a number of gem and jewellery processing and manufacturing machines are proposed to be reduced from the respective existing rates to 40 per cent ad valorem."
2664,1984-85,The gem processing machines would enable significant reduction in processing losses and also improve overall quality and productivity.
2665,1984-85,"Similarly, I also propose to reduce customs duties on specified machines used in packaging of food articles as well as by meat and food processing industries from the respective existing rates to 40 per cent ad valorem."
2666,1984-85,This measure is expected to encourage export of food items in valueadded form and also in consumer packs instead of in bulk.
2667,1984-85,The revenue sacrifice involved in the above proposals is of the order of Rs 5.24 crores.
2668,1984-85,"With the advancement in machine tool technology, CNC machines are progressively replacing conventional machine tools due to their higher productivity and accuracy."
2669,1984-85,"To enable the indigenous machine tool manufacturers to offer CNC machine tools on competitive terms, I propose to reduce the customs duty on CNC systems to 35 per cent."
2670,1984-85,The revenue sacrifice is of the order of Rs 0.82 crore.
2671,1984-85,"To enable the paper industry to obtain its raw materials at reasonable prices and to relieve the pressure on our forest resources, I propose to totally exempt from customs duties wood chips for making pulp for the manufacture of paper or paper board."
2672,1984-85,"On similar considerations, I propose to reduce the duty on wood pulp imported for manufacture of paper from the existing levels to 30 per cent."
2673,1984-85,These measures involve revenue sacrifice of the order of Rs 1.10 crores.
2674,1984-85,"Certain changes in the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962, relating to warehousing, etc. and in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 are also proposed."
2675,1984-85,The details of these proposals have been given in the Budget papers.
2676,1984-85,"Sir, coming now to my proposals in respect of excise duties, my main objectives are to minimise the effects of inflation, lessen scope for tax avoidance and evasion, give a boost to selected industries suffering from demand recession, and ensure better utilisation of the capacity and investment already created."
2677,1984-85,"I propose to continue upto 31st March, 1985 the levy of special excise duties at the existing rates and with the existing exemptions."
2678,1984-85,My first proposal for relief is in respect of khandsari sugar.
2679,1984-85,I propose to fully exempt khandsari sugar from the levy of excise duty.
2680,1984-85,"I am taking this measure in view of the labourintensive character of this industry, and to provide further opportunity for growth of employment in this Industry."
2681,1984-85,"The abolition of excise duty will also help this industry to pay better price to cane growers, and will give relief to a large number of khandsari units located in farflung rural areas."
2682,1984-85,The revenue sacrifice involved in this proposal is Rs 16.42 crores.
2683,1984-85,"Khandsari, I am told, is also better for health."
2684,1984-85,"If as a result of this measure, the health of the nation improves, I hope the credit will flow to me and not to my distinguished colleague, the Health Minister!"
2685,1984-85,Hon’ble Members would recall that excise duty was levied on electricity as a revenue measure in the 1978 Budget.
2686,1984-85,The net proceeds from the duty collected on electricity are wholly distributed to the States.
2687,1984-85,"It is proposed to abolish the excise duty on electricity leaving it to the State Governments to tap this source, to whatever extent and in whatever manner they like."
2688,1984-85,This will give to the States one more area for resource mobilisation.
2689,1984-85,"To give the States some time to take appropriate action, this abolition will be effective from 1st October, 1984."
2690,1984-85,I also propose to provide substantial relief to the textile industry with a view to making cloth cheaper.
2691,1984-85,"Hon’ble Members may recall that in the 1982 and 1983 Budgets, excise duty was reduced to encourage the production of blends with the desirable proportions of polyester."
2692,1984-85,Such fabrics are becoming increasingly popular with the people.
2693,1984-85,"As a further measure of relief in this area and with the overall objective of making such fabrics available at lower prices, I propose to reduce the total excise duty on polyestercotton blended yarn containing more than 40 per cent but less than 70 per cent polyester to Rs 5 per kg."
2694,1984-85,The existing rates of duty on such yarn vary generally from Rs 7.5 per kg.
2695,1984-85,Under my proposal all blends over 40 per cent but below 70 per cent of polyester will pay the same reduced rate of duty.
2696,1984-85,The revenue sacrifice on these accounts is estimated at Rs 33.25 crores in a full year.
2697,1984-85,Blended fabrics have also received my attention.
2698,1984-85,The excise duty on polyestercotton blended fabrics containing more than 40 per cent but less than 70 per cent polyester will be reduced to 2 per cent ad valorem.
2699,1984-85,The Incidence of duty on such fabrics at present varies from 7.5 per cent to 17.8 per cent ad valorem.
2700,1984-85,This 19 concession would cost the exchequer Rs 26.50 crores in a fun year.
2701,1984-85,I also propose that this duty at 2 per cent ad valorem be collected as additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax.
2702,1984-85,"As Hon’ble Members are no doubt aware, proceeds of additional excise duties on textiles go to the States 102."
2703,1984-85,"These changes in the duty structure on polyestercotton blended yarn and polyestercotton blended fabrics will, for a 87:33 blend, reduce the duty incidence by about Rs 3.30 per square metre on a fabric carrying a wholesale price of about Rs 25 per square metre, and a retail price of Rs 35 to 40 per square metre."
2704,1984-85,This duty reduction will enable the industry to sell such fabrics at reduced prices.
2705,1984-85,I also propose to provide relief on cotton fabrics which still constitute a major share of the total production of cloth in the country.
2706,1984-85,I propose to reduce excise duty on cotton fabrics of less than 51 counts and of assessable value not exceeding Rs 5 per square metre.
2707,1984-85,Such fabrics at present pay duty of excise at rates varying from 2.38 per cent to 3.56 per cent ad valorem in the case of composite mills.
2708,1984-85,Concessional rates of duty are allowed for Independent processors processing powerloom and handloom fabrics.
2709,1984-85,I propose to fully exempt handloom and powerloom fabrics of the above varieties processed by Independent processors.
2710,1984-85,The rate of duty for composite mill fabrics is also being reduced to 1 per cent ad valorem retaining more or less the present differential between the independent processors and the  composite mills.
2711,1984-85,This duty would be in the nature of additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax and will entirely go to the States.
2712,1984-85,Such fabrics are mostly consumed by the weaker sections of society.
2713,1984-85,The benefits of the reduction should become available to them in the form of lower prices.
2714,1984-85,This proposal on cotton fabrics would entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 28.40 crores.
2715,1984-85,"I hope, my proposals would also help the textile Industry."
2716,1984-85,The Industry should benefit through Increased demand that lower prices would generate.
2717,1984-85,Cotton yarn and cellulosic spun yarn in the form of cross reel hanks are finding increasing use in the handloom sector.
2718,1984-85,"In the Handloom Year, I propose to reduce the duty incidence on such yarn supplied to registered Handloom Cooperative Societies or to organisations set up or approved for the development of handlooms, by about 50 per cent."
2719,1984-85,This would involve a loss of Rs 3 crores to the exchequer in a full year.
2720,1984-85,"In order to recoup some of the revenue loss flowing from the above package of measures in respect of the textile industry, I propose to increase the incidence of additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent on man made fabrics of assessable value exceeding Rs 25 per square metre."
2721,1984-85,This increase will not apply to those blended fabrics in respect of which duty is being reduced.
2722,1984-85,The impact will be on costlier fabrics which are consumed mainly by the more affluent sections of society.
2723,1984-85,They should not mind this.
2724,1984-85,"On this account, the exchequer will gain by Rs 27 crores in a full year and this, too, would accrue entirely to the States."
2725,1984-85,I also propose to reduce the duty on shoddy blankets and other similar blankets made from shoddy yarn processed by composite mills by about 7 per cent.
2726,1984-85,Such shoddy blankets if processed by independent processors will be wholly exempt.
2727,1984-85,The revenue loss on this account would be Rs 1 crore in a full year.
2728,1984-85,Another industry needing urgent attention is the paper industry.
2729,1984-85,This Industry has been passing through a difficult phase troubled by rising cost of raw materials and other inputs.
2730,1984-85,My proposals aim at encouraging the production of paper and paper board and preserving scarce natural forest resources.
2731,1984-85,I have already referred to the proposed exemption from customs duty on import of wood chips and wood pulp for paper making.
2732,1984-85,"As a further measure of relief, I propose to reduce the basic excise duty on printing and writing paper and also kraft paper produced by large paper mills by Rs 425 per metric tonne, and corresponding concessions are being given on the duty leviable on such paper when unconventional raw materials are used in their manufacture."
2733,1984-85,"Simultaneously, the range of permissible unconventional raw materials is being expanded."
2734,1984-85,No concession for use of unconventional raw material is presently available in the case of paper boards.
2735,1984-85,I propose toreduce the basic excise duty payable on paper boards manufactured from at least 50 per cent unconventional raw materials from the present general level of 10 per cent ad valorem +
2736,1984-85,"Rs 1430 per metric tonne to R * s.560, Rs 900 or Rs 1120 per metric tonne depending on whether the clearances of paper and paper board from such paper mills in the preceding financial year did not exceed 3,000 tonnes, 7,500 tonnes or 16,500 tonnes respectively."
2737,1984-85,"For larger paper mills using unconventional raw materials, the rate of basic excise duty on paper boards is being reduced to 7 per cent ad valorem +"
2738,1984-85,Rs 925 per metric tonne.
2739,1984-85,My proposals relating to the paper Industry would entail a loss of Rs 33 crores in excise duties in a full year.
2740,1984-85,"Along with the customs duty exemptions on Import of wood chips and wood pulp, this package is expected to provide substantial fiscal support to the development of indigenous paper industry and improve the availability of paper at reasonable prices."
2741,1984-85,"Hon’ble Members may recall that certain time bound concessions were given in October, 1983, in respect of certain specified commodities."
2742,1984-85,"Having regard to the industry’s response to that measure which was intended to stimulate production by generating incremental demand, I propose to continue the concession for one year with certain modifications."
2743,1984-85,"In the case of commercial vehicles and threeaxled vehicles, the concession will be continued but the extent of duty concession granted in October, 1983 is being reduced by 21 percentage points."
2744,1984-85,I propose to remove some models of light commercial vehicles from the purview of the exemption in order to establish parity among all models of such vehicles in the matter of the rate of excise duty.
2745,1984-85,These proposals would entail a revenue loss of Rs 45 crores in a full year.
2746,1984-85,"I propose to continue the concessions in the case of refrigerators, deep freezers and parts of refrigerating appliances, etc. storage batteries and domestic electrical appliances."
2747,1984-85,The total revenue sacrifice on these items would be to the tune of Rs 19 crores.
2748,1984-85,"In the case of tyres for buses and trucks and tyres for use offtheroad, I do not propose to continue the concession granted in October, 1983 as there is no further case for this concession in view of the price increases announced by this industry."
2749,1984-85,"However, as a measure if rationalisation and in order to reduce scope for tax evasion, I propose to switch over by and large to a system of specific rates of duties from the ad valorem rates."
2750,1984-85,Production of china and porcelain tableware over the last few years has been showing signs of stagnation and the capacity utilisation has been declining.
2751,1984-85,"With a view to providing relief to the industry, I propose to reduce the basic excise duty from 30 per cent to 15 per cent on these items."
2752,1984-85,This would entail a revenue loss of Rs 1.5 crores.
2753,1984-85,"With summer not very far away, I would like to help the Hon’ble Members in keeping their tempers cool."
2754,1984-85,I propose to reduce basic excise duty on table fans from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and on ceiling fans of a diameter not exceeding 107 cms from 15 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
2755,1984-85,"I also propose to reduce the basic excise duty on evaporative type of coolers, including desert coolers, from 40 per cent to 30 per cent ad valorem."
2756,1984-85,These proposals would involve a revenue sacrifice of Rs 5.10 crores.
2757,1984-85,"As a rationalisation measure, I propose to reduce the basic duty on winding wires from 10 per cent to 5 per cent and increase the basic duty on copper wire rods by Rs 1300 per metric tonne."
2758,1984-85,"On an overall basis, these changes will neither result in a loss nor gain in revenue."
2759,1984-85,"As Hon’ble Members will remember, many reputed artists had published an appeal inviting our attention to piracy."
2760,1984-85,As I “just can’t write these names off” I propose to exempt soundrecorded cassettes wholly from excise duty.
2761,1984-85,"In view of the upward revision of customs duty on magnetic tapes, the revenue loss on this account is expected, by and large, to be made up."
2762,1984-85,"As a general measure of relief I propose to fully exempt laundry soap manufactured by KVIC units and to reduce basic excise duty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent on certain mass consumption items such as Imitation jewellery, stainless steel utensils, glass chimneys for lanterns, high efficient wood burning stoves, umbrellas and saccharine."
2763,1984-85,The revenue sacrifice involved in these concessions is Rs 1.13 crores.
2764,1984-85,Hon’ble Members may recall that an excise duty relief scheme to encourage higher production is in operation for the past two years.
2765,1984-85,I propose to continue the scheme for one more year.
2766,1984-85,"Hon’ble Members would also recall that in the last Budget, I had rationalised the tariff relating to iron and steel items."
2767,1984-85,"This year, I have undertaken a similar exercise in respect of nonferrous metals."
2768,1984-85,The tariff entries are being revised on a more scientific basis.
2769,1984-85,These changes as in last year would be brought into effect from a subsequent date.
2770,1984-85,"Tin then, the present effective rates of duty would continue."
2771,1984-85,"I propose to increase the additional excise duty in respect of cigarettes, The present ratio between basic excise duty and additional excise duty is being altered to 1.75:1."
2772,1984-85,"This measure will result in the transfer of Rs 42.89 crores from the basic excise duty account to the additional excise duty account in the next financial year, and thus increase the accrual to the States."
2773,1984-85,There will be a corresponding reduction in the amount allocated to basic excise duty.
2774,1984-85,The total incidence of excise duties on cigarettes will remain unaltered.
2775,1984-85,There are some other minor proposals which do not have much revenue significance.
2776,1984-85,These include readjustment of duties in some cases and deletion of some tariff items which have remained fully exempted for a long time.
2777,1984-85,In the light of the experience gained in the working of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Customs.
2778,1984-85,"Excise and Gold Control Appellate Tribunal, some amendments are proposed to be carried out in the laws relating to them."
2779,1984-85,These are mainly of an administrative nature.
2780,1984-85,I do not propose to take the time of the House over these proposals.
2781,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the phenomenal increase in central excise revenue from about Rs 100 crores in 195354 to about Rs 10,100 crores in 198384, the Central Excise Tariff has also substantially grown."
2782,1984-85,"I think, it is time to make a comprehensive review of the tariff as it has developed over the last three decades with a view to rationalising it."
2783,1984-85,This would require a detailed study which can best be done only by a technical study group.
2784,1984-85,"I propose, therefore, to appoint such a Group."
2785,1984-85,The proposals that I have presented will yield additional revenue of Rs 465.41 crores in customs duties and Rs 33.10 crores in excise duties.
2786,1984-85,There would be a transfer of Rs 43.64 crores from the basic duty account to the additional duty in lieu of sales tax account.
2787,1984-85,The concessions and reliefs aggregate Rs 7.26 crores on the customs side and Rs 222.43 crores on the excise side.
2788,1984-85,The net yield from customs duties is Rs 458.15 crores.
2789,1984-85,The net loss from excise duties comes to Rs 189.33 crores out of which Centre’s share would be Rs 148.95 crores and States’ share would be Rs 40.38 crores.
2790,1984-85,"This takes into account the States, share from additional excise duties in lieu of sales tax to the extent of Rs 52.31 crores."
2791,1984-85,The accrual to the central exchequer for the additional tax effort in a full year would be Rs 309.20 crores.
2792,1984-85,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from the 1st March, 1984 will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
2793,1984-85,I had earlier stated that the budgetary deficit at the existing rates of taxation would be Rs 2035 crores.
2794,1984-85,"The tax measures proposed now, taken together with reliefs and concessions, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 272.88 crores to the Centre."
2795,1984-85,This leaves an uncovered deficit of Rs 1762 crores.
2796,1984-85,It has been my endeavour to keep the budgetary deficit to a relatively low figure and I am sure the Hon’ble Members would agree that this order of deficit is appropriate to our circumstances.
2797,1984-85,"I hope that the low deficit, combined with my proposals for boosting production and lowering prices, will have a salutary effect on the inflationary psychology in the economy."
2798,1984-85,"If I may, at this point, quote from Kautilya’s Arthashastra:– A ́ÉÆ BÉÖEaÉÉÇioÉàÉÖnaÉÆ ́ÉßÉËr SÉÉaÉoaÉ n¶ÉÇaÉäiÉ*"

2800,1984-85,"Four years ago, my distinguished predecessor, while presenting the first Budget of the present Government, had expressed our firm resolve to repair the damage and restore the country’s economy to the path of stability, growth and social justice."
2801,1984-85,"Mr. Speaker, we have kept that promise."
2802,1984-85,I commend this Budget to the House.
2803,1985-86,I am conscious of the fact that the tremendous responsibility that has devolved on us at this critical juncture arises not only from the office that we hold but more so from the immense trust that the people have reposed in us.
2804,1985-86,We pledge all our endeavour to justify this trust of the common man.
2805,1985-86,"I am reminded of the words of our beloved departed leader, the late Prime Minister Smt."
2806,1985-86,Indira Gandhi: “No section of our vast and diverse population should feel forgotten.
2807,1985-86,Their neglect is our collective loss.”
2808,1985-86,"We can no longer hear her voice, but her words will live with us."
2809,1985-86,"In the task of nationbuilding, she spared herself no pain  not even the pain of death."
2810,1985-86,She has left us a legacy signed in her own blood; a legacy to preserve this country and keep it moving ahead.
2811,1985-86,To this cause of hers we rededicate ourselves.
2812,1985-86,"The Economic Survey, which has been presented to the House, deals with economic developments in the current year in detail."
2813,1985-86,"I shall, therefore, touch upon only a few salient features of the current economic situation."
2814,1985-86,The overall growth in national income in 198485 is anticipated to be of the order of 4 per cent on top of 7.4 per cent recorded in the previous year.
2815,1985-86,Food production in 198384 turned out to be even better than what was anticipated at this time last year.
2816,1985-86,Output of foodgrains reached 151.5 million tonnes from the level of about 130 million tones in 198283.
2817,1985-86,Agricultural growth in 198384 was 13.6 per cent.
2818,1985-86,"In 198485, food production is likely to be around the record level achieved in the previous year."
2819,1985-86,"Industrial production also recovered during the year and, according to present indications, it may show a growth rate of about 7 per cent in 198485."
2820,1985-86,"For the Sixth Plan as a whole, however, the growth rate in industry is likely to average about 6 per cent, which is below the Plan target."
2821,1985-86,The major infrastructure sectors performed reasonably well in 198485.
2822,1985-86,"Power generation during the period AprilDecember 1984 was 13.5 per cent higher than in the same period of the previous year, as compared with an increase of 7.6 per cent in 198384."
2823,1985-86,Coal production increased by 6.9 per cent during AprilDecember 1 I deem it a great privilege to present the first Budget of the new Government.
2824,1985-86,"Freight movement by rail, which had stagnated in 198384, picked up in the current year with a modest growth of 3.2 per cent in the first nine months."
2825,1985-86,Our balance of payments situation during the year was comfortable with a net accretion in reserves of about Rs 547 crores upto end  January 1985.
2826,1985-86,"Although a part of the increase in rupee terms is because of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, it is heartening that the improvement in the balance of payments situation witnessed in 198384 was sustained during the current year."
2827,1985-86,"Trade data, available upto November, 1984, show an increase in exports by 23 per cent and that in imports by 14 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year."
2828,1985-86,"Trade deficit, on provisional basis, is estimated at Rs 3016 crores in the current year upto November as compared with Rs 3080 crores in the previous year."
2829,1985-86,"It will be recalled that the Government had voluntarily terminated the International Monetary Fund arrangement with effect from 1st May, 1984 after drawing only Special Drawing Rights 3.9 billion out of Special Drawing Rights 5 billion available under the loan arrangement."
2830,1985-86,That we have been able to do so is a testimony to our sound financial management during a period when the external environment has been highly unfavourable.
2831,1985-86,"The rate of inflation which was causing concern towards the end of the last year, could be effectively contained by the implementation of various anti inflationary measures, including curbs on expenditure, coupled with an imaginative supply management and timely imports."
2832,1985-86,"We also, of course, had the benefit of two successive good crops."
2833,1985-86,"Thus, the annual rate of inflation in wholesale prices on 23rd February, 1985 was 5.2 per cent as compared with 10.0 per cent at the same time last year."
2834,1985-86,The consumer price index has also shown an increase of only 4.4 per cent in January 1985 over the level 12 months ago as compared with an increase of 13.7 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.
2835,1985-86,"On the whole, therefore, the economy is functioning well."
2836,1985-86,That the country has been able to make all this progress within a democratic framework is no mean achievement.
2837,1985-86,"In a country where a large proportion of the population is below the poverty line, to have raised the necessary resources for its development without material external help and yet preserve the ballotbox is a tribute to the sagacity of the political leadership of the country."
2838,1985-86,"However, we should not be lulled into a false sense of complacency as the task ahead is arduous."
2839,1985-86,I would now like to share with the Hon’ble Members my perception of the challenges that we face and the Government’s response to meeting them.
2840,1985-86,"As we enter the Seventh Plan, the resource constraint has become acute, both at the Centre, and the States."
2841,1985-86,The basic problem is that our nonPlan expenditure has been increasing at a rate substantially faster than the growth of current revenues.
2842,1985-86,"As a result, budgetary resources for the Plan have been severely eroded."
2843,1985-86,"Defence, 2 interest payments, and food and fertiliser subsidies now account for nearly 70 per cent of the nonPlan revenue expenditure of the Centre."
2844,1985-86,"A sizeable part of the remaining 30 per cent of such expenditure is accounted for by essential maintenance, social and community services, and grants to States."
2845,1985-86,"Further, the increase in nonPlan expenditures of the States has meant larger transfers to States on this account."
2846,1985-86,"In the past few years, we have been able to finance large increases in the Annual Plan largely through borrowings, both external and internal."
2847,1985-86,"However, this cannot go on indefinitely."
2848,1985-86,"The process of pruning budgetary expenditure at the Centre and at the States, however painful, must begin so that the necessary adjustment can take place over a period of time."
2849,1985-86,"The public sector is vital for faster industrialisation, balanced regional development, and prevention of concentration of wealth and economic power."
2850,1985-86,"Over the years, the public sector has grown rapidly, and an important priority now is to ensure that there is sufficient internal generation of resources for its future growth."
2851,1985-86,"Given our resource constraint, increasing levels of investments in the public sector are feasible only through better utilisation of existing capacity and higher return on past investments."
2852,1985-86,The Seventh Plan will give particular attention to this aspect.
2853,1985-86,The recent improvement in the balance of payments is gratifying.
2854,1985-86,"However, this is an area where there can be no room for complacency."
2855,1985-86,Some of the factors that have worked in our favour in the Sixth Plan will not operate with the same vigour in the Seventh Plan.
2856,1985-86,"Oil production, which had increased by about 18 million tonnes during the last five years, may not increase at the same rate in the future."
2857,1985-86,Repayments of the International Monetary Fund loan and external commercial borrowings would also increase sharply.
2858,1985-86,"Recent developments in the world economy have dot only reduced the availability of external resources for development, but have also made their terms distinctly harder."
2859,1985-86,The alternative source of external commercial borrowing is expensive.
2860,1985-86,The room for manoeuvre in terms of increasing the surplus on account of invisibles is also limited.
2861,1985-86,"There can be little doubt that if we have to reconcile a manageable balance of payments situation with a tolerable debt profile, export earnings would have to finance a larger and larger proportion of our impots so that the deficit in our balance of payments is reduced."
2862,1985-86,"In the context of the need to conserve scarce foreign exchange, it would be desirable to increase the domestic production of importables wherever we have underutilized capacities."
2863,1985-86,"It is necessary also to stress efficient import substitution, in an economic sense rather than the physical sense, so that considerations relating to cost and efficiency are incorporated in the framework of policies."
2864,1985-86,Agricultural and rural development is at the centre of our planning.
2865,1985-86,"Control of inflation, reduction in poverty levels, promotion of employment, and improvement in our balance of payments are goals which are linked with our success in agriculture."
2866,1985-86,"Our past record has been good, which underscores the soundness of our agricultural strategy involving structural changes in rural economic relations, greater application of new technology and fertilisers, and increase in the irrigated area."
2867,1985-86,"But, much more remains to be done on each count."
2868,1985-86,"We have to tackle the problem of increasing yields in different regions, particularly in respect of paddy."
2869,1985-86,We also have to pay special attention to increasing domestic output of oilseeds through more intensive cultivation of existing varieties and development of new ones.
2870,1985-86,"Import of edible oils is a major drain on our foreign exchange resources, and higher domestic production will benefit the economy in several ways."
2871,1985-86,It is the policy of the Government to provide remunerative prices to our farmers.
2872,1985-86,"The price support operations are already functioning well in respect of certain major agricultural commodities, like wheat and rice."
2873,1985-86,"The Government will, over a period of time, extend effective price support operations to other important crops also, particularly oilseeds and pulses."
2874,1985-86,"A crop failure, in the event of a drought or flood, can have disastrous effect on the livelihood of our farmers and their families."
2875,1985-86,"The Government has, therefore, decided to introduce a comprehensive scheme of crop insurance."
2876,1985-86,"Hence forth, there will be a builtin insurance cover for all crop loans."
2877,1985-86,The insurance cover will be provided up to 150 per cent of the crop loan.
2878,1985-86,"To begin with, the scheme will be extended to wheat, paddy, oilseeds and pulses."
2879,1985-86,The insurance charges will be low.
2880,1985-86,"The marginal and, small farmers will be subsidised to the extent of twothirds of the insurance charges by Central and State Governments on a matching basis."
2881,1985-86,"Details of the scheme, which are being worked out, will be announced separately."
2882,1985-86,"The integrated Rural Development Programme, the National Rural Employment Programme, the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme, and the Programme for providing selfemployment opportunities to the educated unemployed, have helped to reduce the incidence of poverty and have contributed to increasing the employment opportunities."
2883,1985-86,Government is committed to further strengthen and improve the performance of these special programmes.
2884,1985-86,The generation of adequate employment opportunities is at the heart of our development efforts.
2885,1985-86,Measures being taken now to stimulate the economy will have an important beneficial impact on the employment situation.
2886,1985-86,"Government proposes to introduce a Social Security Scheme to cover the risk of death by accident in respect of earning members of poor families comprising landless labourers, small and marginal farmers, traditional craftsmen and others not covered by any insurance scheme or workmen’s compensation arrangements."
2887,1985-86,"Under this scheme, a sum of Rs 3000/ will be paid to the dependent of the deceased, who dies as a result of an accident."
2888,1985-86,"The scheme will, to begin with, be introduced in 100 districts in the country, selected in consultation with the States."
2889,1985-86,I hope all sections of the House will welcome this measure which will cover the needs of the poorest families in their moment of utter deprivation.
2890,1985-86,"I am glad to inform the House that the target of priority sector advances, including advances for agriculture and small scale industry, which was fixed at 40 per cent by end of 198485, has already been exceeded by public sector banks."
2891,1985-86,"This is a major achievement in view of the fact that advances to priority sectors were less than 15 per cent in 1969, when the banks were nationalised."
2892,1985-86,A problem that we now face is the slow pace of recovery of past loans.
2893,1985-86,Hon’ble Members will appreciate that it is not possible for the credit system to fulfil the task assigned to it unless performance in repayment of past loans improves.
2894,1985-86,An important task for the future is to accelerate industrial growth.
2895,1985-86,"At the same time, we must ensure that the pattern of industrial growth conforms to our socio economic priorities."
2896,1985-86,"Our domestic market is large, the structure of industry is already diversified, and the base of entrepreneurship has grown."
2897,1985-86,We must now aim at reducing costs and prices and improve the competitiveness of our industry.
2898,1985-86,This process calls for structural changes in the economy and will entail some costs which we should be prepared to pay.
2899,1985-86,Unproductive investments of the past should not stifle the productive forces of the future.
2900,1985-86,Indian industry must also become more selfreliant in financing investment.
2901,1985-86,Regulations must facilitate growth and respond to the changing external and technological environment.
2902,1985-86,"In particular, it is necessary to bring about closer coordination among fiscal, industrial and trade policies."
2903,1985-86,A multipronged programme of action is necessary to meet the challenges of the future.
2904,1985-86,"As our Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi observed recently, in the Parliament: “The challenges before our country are many."
2905,1985-86,We have to modernise India.
2906,1985-86,We have to change the thinking of the people of India to look ahead into the future and not to keep on dwelling on the past.
2907,1985-86,We have to make India selfreliant in every important sphere.
2908,1985-86,We have to create a dynamic country that is equal to any other country in the world.”
2909,1985-86,"In this task, our greatest asset is the human resource, and crucial to the success of all our policies is the development of an effective programme for best utilisation of this resource through renewed emphasis on education, environment, and the application of science and technology."
2910,1985-86,I now propose to announce a few decisions which are designed to reduce regidities and improve the environment for industrial growth.
2911,1985-86,It is proposed to notify a list of industries for delicensing so that procedural delays are cut to a minimum in areas where we want additional capacity.
2912,1985-86,"In order to reflect the considerable increase in the cost and the economic size of projects that has taken place since the asset Emit for MRTP companies was fixed in 1969, this limit is being revised to Rs 100 crores."
2913,1985-86,The small scale sector has played a vital role in our economy and the Government proposes to take further steps to promote its growth.
2914,1985-86,"The ceiling of investment in plant and machinery, which was fixed in 1980, is being raised from Rs 20 lakhs to Rs 35 5 lakhs."
2915,1985-86,The Ceiling in respect of ancillaries is being raised from the present level of Rs 25 lakhs to Rs 45 lakhs.
2916,1985-86,"Later in my speech, I shall be announcing certain fiscal measures to facilitate development of this sector."
2917,1985-86,"On the financial side, I propose to facilitate the mobilisation of resources from the market by the corporate sector and to reduce its dependence on public financial institutions."
2918,1985-86,"With a view to improving the marketability of convertible debentures of nonMRTP and nonFERA companies, the maximum interest payable by them on such issues is being raised from 13.5 per cent to 15 per cent."
2919,1985-86,"The Securities Contracts Regulation Act, 1956, is being amended to ensure free transfer of securities of listed public limited companies."
2920,1985-86,This measure will particularly benefit small investors spread all over the country.
2921,1985-86,"In order to offer wide choice to investors, certain changes are being made in respect of listing requirements of closelyheld companies."
2922,1985-86,Such companies will be permitted to enlist by offering 40 per cent of their equity capital in two stages over a period of 3 years and capitalise a larger portion of their free reserves before going to the public.
2923,1985-86,"In order to diversify the market, a new instrument, namely, Convertible Cumulative Preference Share is being introduced."
2924,1985-86,Several measures to reduce the prevailing high cost of public issues are being announced separately.
2925,1985-86,The corporate sector should also be permitted to play a legitimate role within defined norms in the functioning of our democracy.
2926,1985-86,It is proposed to introduce the necessary legislation during this session to allow companies to make contribution to political parties from out of their profits.
2927,1985-86,The Government proposes to introduce a special legislation for sick units.
2928,1985-86,"It is proposed to set up a Board for Financial and Industrial Reconstruction, which will provide a speedy mechanism for amalgamation, mergers and devise such other solutions as may be necessary to deal with the problem of sick units in the large and medium sector."
2929,1985-86,"The onus for reporting sickness will be laid on the management of the units themselves, who will be required to seek a fresh mandate from their shareholders after 50 per cent of the net worth of the company has been eroded."
2930,1985-86,"When the company loses its entire net worth, the existing management and the owners will not have any further role to play in running the affairs of the unit."
2931,1985-86,It is also proposed that those who are deemed to be responsible for mismanaging the unit will not have access to assistance from financial institutions even in new ventures.
2932,1985-86,"Bad managers, like bad currency, have to be kept out of circulation."
2933,1985-86,Workers are the worst victims of Industrial sickness.
2934,1985-86,"Under the present law, however, when companies are wound up, workers’ dues rank low in priority compared to secured creditors."
2935,1985-86,"To my mind, labour is as much a factor of production as any other and it is unjust that the workers’ dues should have a lower priority."
2936,1985-86,"In order to rectify this situation, we have taken a decision to introduce the necessary legislation so that legitimate dues of workers rank pari passu with secured creditors such as banks in the event of closure of the Company."
2937,1985-86,Such dues will rank above even 6 the dues to Government.
2938,1985-86,The Government is also considering the introduction of a scheme of stock options to the employees and workers of companies to encourage their participation in management.
2939,1985-86,"At present, under the Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 where the salary or wage of an employee exceeds Rs 750/ per month, the bonus payable to such employee is calculated as if his salary or wage was Rs 750/ per month."
2940,1985-86,"It is now proposed to raise this limit to Rs 1,600/ per month."
2941,1985-86,The eligibility criteria would remain the same.
2942,1985-86,"In addition to the changes being made in the overall policy framework, the Government is also undertaking a review of certain specific industries with a view to correcting structural imbalances."
2943,1985-86,"Textile industry has a vital place in our economy in terms of its contribution to output, exports and employment."
2944,1985-86,"This industry is, however, passing through a very difficult period and the need for structural change is pressing."
2945,1985-86,I shall be proposing certain changes in the fiscal structure of cotton textile industry.
2946,1985-86,The preparation of a new textile policy is well under way.
2947,1985-86,The electronics industry is truly the industry of our times.
2948,1985-86,"In order to accelerate the growth of this industry, in November, 1984, the Government announced a new package of measures for computers."
2949,1985-86,"Rates of duty on imports of components and raw materials were reduced drastically and, in order to protect the interests of endusers, import policy for computers was also liberalised."
2950,1985-86,It has now been decided to extend this approach to other items of manufacture in electronics.
2951,1985-86,Details of the new policy will be announced separately by the Department of Electronics.
2952,1985-86,I shall now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198485 and the Budget Estimates for 198586.
2953,1985-86,Revised Estimates for 198485 33.
2954,1985-86,There were several unanticipated developments on the budgetary front during the yew.
2955,1985-86,"On the Plan side, higher budgetary provisions had to be provided for the Central and State Plans."
2956,1985-86,"On the nonPlan side, there was substantial increase in expenditure on defence, food and fertiliser subsidies, and payment of dearness allowance to Government employees."
2957,1985-86,"Larger assistance was given to States affected by floods and cyclones, and medium term loan has been provided to certain States facing acute financial problems."
2958,1985-86,"On the receipts side, there was some increase in tax revenues and a significant stepup in small savings collections."
2959,1985-86,"The budgetary support for the Central Plan is now estimated to be higher at Rs 11,751 crores as against the original outlay of Rs 11,420 crores."
2960,1985-86,"The revised Central Plan outlay is estimated to be Rs 17,495 crores as against the Budget Estimate of Rs 17,351 crores."
2961,1985-86,"Within this overall amount, there were certain changes in the sectoral outlays."
2962,1985-86,The provision for selfemployment scheme for educated unemployed youth was increased by Rs 124 crores and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development was provided an additional amount of Rs 152 crores against 7 disbursements under external aid programmes.
2963,1985-86,"Additional provisions were also made for Visakhapatnam Steel Plant, mines, nonconventional energy sources, atomic energy, electronics, food storage godowns, and certain other sectors."
2964,1985-86,"The Revised Estimates of the Central Plan outlay in some areas, notably, petroleum, coal, and fertilisers were, however, lower."
2965,1985-86,The provision made in the Budget for Central assistance for State Plans has also been stepped up by Rs 153 crores.
2966,1985-86,"On the nonPlan side, during the year, nine instalments of additional dearness allowance including relief to pensioners, were sanctioned to Central Government employees."
2967,1985-86,These are estimated to cost about Rs 715 crores in the current year against the lump sum provision of Rs 300 crores made in the Budget.
2968,1985-86,Ad hoc bonus sanctioned to Government employees in the current year would cost Rs 61 crores.
2969,1985-86,Food subsidy in the current year will increase from Rs 850 crores to Rs 1100 crores.
2970,1985-86,"This is mainly due to increase in procurement price of paddy, lower realisation from sale of wheat and sharp increase in stocks of foodgrains."
2971,1985-86,The subsidy on domestic fertilisers will go up from Rs 930 crores to Rs 1200 crores.
2972,1985-86,The subsidy on imported fertilisers will increase from Rs 150 crores to Rs 632 crores owing to increase in the cost and volume of imports.
2973,1985-86,Assistance to States affected by floods and cyclones was stepped up by Rs 130 crores.
2974,1985-86,"Consequent on larger small savings collections, the share payable to States was also increased by Rs 440 crores."
2975,1985-86,The provision for loans to States for purchase of agricultural inputs was stepped up by Rs 60 crores.
2976,1985-86,"In addition, special mediumterm loan of Rs 440 crores has also been provided to States which faced serious financial difficulties during the year."
2977,1985-86,Defence expenditure in the current year is estimated at Rs 7175 crores against the Budget Estimates of Rs 6800 crores.
2978,1985-86,"Interest payments are expected to be Rs 390 crores higher than the original estimate of Rs 5,600 crores."
2979,1985-86,Certain public sector enterprises have suffered large cash losses and additional budgetary support had to be provided to them.
2980,1985-86,"Taking into account these and other variations, including notional provisions for conversion of equity in certain public undertakings into loans, assistance towards their interest dues to Government and additional subscription to International Monetary Fund, the total nonPlan expenditure is estimated at Rs 29,740 crores against the Budget Estimates of Rs 26,066 crores."
2981,1985-86,"Under nontax revenue, the dividend from Railways is likely to be less by Rs 211 crores."
2982,1985-86,The profit from sale of edible oil will also be less due to high international prices.
2983,1985-86,"Mainly due to additional budgetary support provided to certain public undertakings and improvements in the finances of some others, interest receipts from public sector undertakings and others are, however, estimated to be Rs 439 crores higher than the Budget Estimates."
2984,1985-86,"Under capital receipts, I am glad to report that small savings collections during the year are now expected to reach Rs 3,300 crores against the Budget Estimate of Rs 2,400 crores."
2985,1985-86,Receipts from special deposits of nongovernment provident funds are estimated to be higher by Rs 75 crores and deposits by public sector undertakings of their surplus funds by Rs 200 crores.
2986,1985-86,"Corresponding to the increase in expenditure, receipts from special securities to International Monetary Fund will also go up by Rs 149 crores."
2987,1985-86,"Taking into account the additional recoveries from State Governments and other variations, capital receipts in the current year are estimated at Rs 17,778 crores compared with the Budget Estimate of Rs 16,757 crores."
2988,1985-86,"Total receipts are thus estimated to go up from Rs 40,763 crores to Rs 42,710 crores."
2989,1985-86,"This will leave a budgetary deficit of Rs 3,985 crores as compared with Rs 1,773 crores in the Budget Estimates."
2990,1985-86,The deficit is higher than what I would have ideally liked.
2991,1985-86,"I am glad that this deficit has been absorbed by the economy without any adverse effects on prices, thanks to the favourable agricultural situation."
2992,1985-86,"Howerver, as a necessary caution, in the coming year we would need to curtail the size of the deficit, though it has been said that “anyone who lives within his means suffers from lack of imagination”."
2993,1985-86,"Not that I lack imagination, but I do not propose to run riot."
2994,1985-86,Budget Estimates for 198586 44.
2995,1985-86,The current year marks the end of the Sixth Plan.
2996,1985-86,"It is estimated that public sector Plan expenditure during the Sixth Plan period will be of the order of Rs 1,10,000 crores as against the originally envisaged outlay of Rs 97,500 crores."
2997,1985-86,"In view of the price rise during the period, outlays in real terms will, however, be lower than in the original Plan."
2998,1985-86,"Nevertheless, it is gratifying that the target of 5.2 per cent for the annual growth rate of the economy would have been met."
2999,1985-86,"Foodgrains output will be close to the Plan target, and crude oil production will significantly exceed it."
3000,1985-86,"In power, additional installed capacity has been below Plan target; nevertheless, we would have added nearly 50 per cent to the existing installed capacity at the beginning of the Plan."
3001,1985-86,"In irrigation, additions to potential would be around 11.5 million hectares as against the Plan target of 13.7 million hectares."
3002,1985-86,"As we enter the Seventh Plan, the main task is to consolidate the gains of the past and give a new thrust to the movement for increasing productivity, while at the same time ensuring financial and monetary stability."
3003,1985-86,"After taking into account higher devolution and grants to States arising out of the implementation of the recommendations of the Finance Commission, and essential nonPlan expenditure on account of defence and subsidies, the budgetary resources available for the Plan in 198586 are far short of our overall requirements."
3004,1985-86,I was particularly guided by the need to provide greater Central assistance for State Plans as otherwise many States would not 9 be in a position even to protect their ongoing projects in crucial sectors.
3005,1985-86,"When the States’ Plans for 198485 were approved, it was expected that the States’ own budgetary resources as also contributions from their public sector undertakings would be Rs 5,740 crores."
3006,1985-86,"The latest assessment indicates deterioration of the order of Rs 2,300 crores in the transactions of the current year."
3007,1985-86,"Central assistance to State Plans in 198586 is being increased to about Rs 6,000 crores as comapred with Rs 4,313 crores in 198485, which is an increase of 39 per cent as compared with an increase of 13 per cent provided last year."
3008,1985-86,"The States have also been authorised to go in for higher market borrowings to the tune of Rs 1,600 crores, which is an increase of 20 per cent over 198485."
3009,1985-86,"This order of increase in Central assistance and market borrowings, on top of other transfers, has made a heavy draft on Centre’s own resources for the Plan."
3010,1985-86,"In view of the elections in several States, the annual Plans of the States have not yet been finalised."
3011,1985-86,It is expected that the process of finalising the State Plans will be completed in the next few weeks.
3012,1985-86,"In view of the sharp increase in central transfers on account of Plan as well as Finance Commission’s recommendations, Centre’s resources are already overstretched, and it will not be possible for the Centre to bear the additional burden of overdrafts by the States."
3013,1985-86,"For, ultimately, it is the common man who pays."
3014,1985-86,"Despite a large stepup in Central assistance, market borrowings and negotiated loans, a reasonable Plan outlay for the States would be possible only if they make an earnest effort at mobilising a higher level of resources and improving the working of States enterprises."
3015,1985-86,Plan outlays of Union territories have been fixed at Rs 640 crores as against Rs 558 crores in 198485.
3016,1985-86,Central Budget provides Rs 578 crores and the balance of Rs 62 crores will be met through additional resource mobilisation measures of the Union territories during the course of the year.
3017,1985-86,"The Central Plan for 198586 has been fixed at Rs 18,500 crores as compared with Rs 17,351 crores in 198485."
3018,1985-86,"In view of the resource constraint, while determining sectoral priorities, I have considered it prudent to complete projects already under implementation rather than taking on new starts."
3019,1985-86,It is also my endeavour to provide more for projects which are in an advanced stage of execution and which can be commissioned more speedily so that the benefits can start flowing to the economy as early as possible.
3020,1985-86,"Earlier in my speech, I referred to the excellent performance of the agricultural sector."
3021,1985-86,"In order to augment the efforts of State Governments in accelerating investment in agriculture, in the Central Plan an outlay of Rs 790 crores has been provided for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation and Department of Agricultural Research and Education."
3022,1985-86,A provision of Rs  165 crores has been made for the new fertiliser factories at Guna and Aonla which are to be set up based on Bombay Righ gas to be transported through the HaziraBijaipurJagdishpur pipeline.
3023,1985-86,A total provision of Rs 932 crores has been made for Rural Development in the Central Plan.
3024,1985-86,"Pending finalisation of the State Plans, the provisions for Integrated Rural Development Programme and National Rural Employment Programme have been kept at more or less the same level as in the current year and will be enhanced later, if required."
3025,1985-86,Honourable members should be glad to know that projects worth more than Rs 800 crores have been sanctioned for implementation under the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme.
3026,1985-86,This programme will have an outlay of Rs 400 crores in 198586.
3027,1985-86,Honourable Members are well aware of the Government’s emphasis on the restructuring of the educational system.
3028,1985-86,We are in the process of evolving a new National Policy on Education.
3029,1985-86,The Government is committed to making the education of girls free all over the country upto the Higher Secondary level.
3030,1985-86,A total provision of Rs 221 crores has been made for Education in the Central Sector including provisions for these new initiatives.
3031,1985-86,"Consistent with our goal to achieve a net reproduction rate of unity by the year 2000 A.D., the Government would go in for an imaginative family planning programme on voluntary basis."
3032,1985-86,"Combined with effective immunization programme to reduce the mortality and morbidity rate among children, Family Welfare programmes are of great significance in the context of overall development."
3033,1985-86,An outlay of Rs 500 crores has been provided for Family Welfare programmes.
3034,1985-86,"In order to effectively use the results of medical research, outlay for Indian Council of Medical Research has been increased to Rs 30 crores."
3035,1985-86,"During the Sixth Plan, the Government launched the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme to assist the States and Union territories in providing drinking water supply to villages."
3036,1985-86,Members would be happy to know that the allocation during the Sixth Plan period on this programme would exceed Rs 925 crores against the original outlay of Rs 600 crores and that this has enabled the States to cover about two lakh problem villages during the Plan period.
3037,1985-86,The potential of Indian Science and Technology for contributing to modernisation and development is immense.
3038,1985-86,"An outlay of Rs 1068 crores is being provided for Ministries of Science and Technology and Environment and Departments like Atomic Energy, Space, Ocean Development and Electronics."
3039,1985-86,"On the energy front, the Government attaches great importance to the need for a gradual transition from the present dependence on oil to coal and electricity in the medium term."
3040,1985-86,Honourable Members would be happy to note that additional power generating capacity to the extent of 14000 M.W. would have been added by the end of the Sixth Plan period.
3041,1985-86,"Ibis would mean a near 50 per cent increase over the capacity of 28,448 M.W. at the commencement of the Plan."
3042,1985-86,"In the Central Sector alone, additional capacity to the extent of 3,350 M.W. has been added during the Sixth 11 Plan."
3043,1985-86,"For 198586, the Department of Power has been provided an outlay of Rs 2090 crores against Rs 1446 crores during 198485."
3044,1985-86,Coal production of 147.5 million tonnes is expected to be achieved in 198485.
3045,1985-86,This is to be stepped up to 158.50 million tonnes in 198586.
3046,1985-86,"For the Department of Coal, an outlay of Rs 1102 crores has been provided."
3047,1985-86,"Honourable Members are well aware of the quantum jump in the field of crude production, which would be 29.4 million tonnes by the end of this year compared to 11.4 million tonnes at the beginning of the Sixth Plan."
3048,1985-86,"This has become possible due to the Accelerated Production Programme initiated in 198283, which has raised the annual production from Bombay High to 20.3 million tonnes from a level of 4.2 million tonnes in 197980."
3049,1985-86,"For the Department of Petroleum, an outlay of Rs 3261 crores is being provided."
3050,1985-86,"A provision of Rs 100 crores has been made for the Gas Authority of India, a newly created organisation for the construction of gas pipelines."
3051,1985-86,The Government’s concern for preservation of our forests is reflected in the creation of a separate department of Forest and Wild Life.
3052,1985-86,"This Department will have an outlay of around Rs 54 crores, including Rs 26 crores for social forestry and creation of rural fuel wood plantation."
3053,1985-86,"The outlay for the Department of Environment is about Rs 36 crores, which includes Rs 10 crores for initiating action on the project of Prevention of Pollution of the Ganga."
3054,1985-86,"The other major environmental programmes aim at conserving biological diversity, pollution monitoring, ecodevelopment in critically degraded or fragile areas and research and development, besides creation of advanced centres for priority environmental studies."
3055,1985-86,"Though a substantial portion has been transferred to the States as committed nonPlan liability, the Central Plan provides for Rs 207 crores for the various programmes benefiting the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."
3056,1985-86,Centre’s contribution to the Special Component Plan for Scheduled Castes has been stepped up to Rs 165 crores.

3059,1985-86,This plan envisaged setting up of large number of High Power and Low Power transmitters in the country so as to make the TV programmes available to 70 per cent of the country’s population.

3062,1985-86,The priorities outlined in Annual Plan for 198586 will further accelerate the implementation of the 20 point programme.
3063,1985-86,"The total amount allocated to the programme in the Central Plan is Rs 4900 crores for the next year as against Rs 4,141 crores provided for in the current year, representing an increase of 18.3 per cent."
3064,1985-86,"I must, however, emphasise that proper implementation of the Plan requires not only financial allocations but also better project formulation and efficient management."
3065,1985-86,It is proposed to make certain changes in the administrative procedures to facilitate quicker plan implementation.
3066,1985-86,"Before an investment decision is taken, administrative Ministries will be required to ensure that projects have been fully worked out and the executive authorities have taken the necessary preparatory action for implementation."
3067,1985-86,"It has, therefore, been decided to provide sufficient funding for preparation of detailed feasibility reports before budgetary allocations are made for projects."
3068,1985-86,Steps are also being considered to advance the finalisation of the annual Plan and Vote on Account to facilitate communication of funds well before the commencement of the new financial year.
3069,1985-86,These measures would result in even implementation of projects throughout the year and avoid the rush of expenditure towards the close of the year.
3070,1985-86,NonPlan expenditure has been kept to the minimum.
3071,1985-86,Next year’s Budget provides larger transfers to States in terms of the recommendations of the Eighth Finance Commission.

3073,1985-86,Defence expenditure next year is placed at Rs 7686 crores excluding defence pensions.
3074,1985-86,Interest payments are estimated at Rs 7075 crores taking into account the increase in the volume of borrowings and the cost of borrowing.
3075,1985-86,"A provision of Rs  1100 crores has been made for food subsidy, Rs 1200 crores for subsidy on domestic fertilisers and Rs 601 crores for subsidy on imported fertilisers."

3079,1985-86,"A lump sum of Rs 300 corres has been provided in 198586 for payment of additional instalments of dearness allowance, pensionary relief, etc., to Central Government employees."

3081,1985-86,"Including these and other provisions, total nonPlan expenditure in 198586 is estimated at Rs 32,786 crores against Rs 29,740 crores in Revised Estimates for the current year."

3084,1985-86,The Commission which was appointed in July 1983 is still at work.
3085,1985-86,"Meanwhile, a very large number of Government employees have been retiring without the benefit of a higher pension which was anticipated as a result of the recommendations of the Commission."
3086,1985-86,"At 13 present, pension is calculated on the pay and a part of dearness allowance sanctioned upto the average Consumer Price Index level of 320."
3087,1985-86,The last instalment of dearness allowance has been sanctioned with reference to the average Consumer Price Index level of 568.
3088,1985-86,"I now propose, as a measure of relief to the Central Government employees retiring on or after 31st March, 1985, to treat the entire dearness allowance sanctioned upto the average Consumer Price Index level of 568 as pay for the purpose of retirement benefit."
3089,1985-86,"Simultaneously, I also propose to remove the present ceiling of Rs 1,500/ per month on pension and increase the ceiling of DeathcumRetirement Gratuity from Rs 36,000/ to Rs 50,000/, The House will agree with me that those who have devoted the best years of their lives to the service of the country are deserving of whatever support we can give them."
3090,1985-86,"Coming to receipts, the gross tax revenue at existing levels of taxation is estimated at Rs 25,514 crores compared with Rs 23,702 crores in the current year."
3091,1985-86,The States’ share of taxes is estimated at Rs 6592 crores against Rs 5777 crores in the current year.
3092,1985-86,"Out of this increase, Rs 487 crores are due to stepping up of States’ share of basic excise duties from 40 per cent to 45 per cent from next year as recommended by the Eighth Finance Commission."
3093,1985-86,The dividend from Railways will be Rs 303 crores higher than in the current year.
3094,1985-86,Receipts from market loans are placed at Rs 5100 crores against Rs 4100 crores in the current year.
3095,1985-86,Small savings collections are estimated at Rs 3900 crores against Rs 3300 crores in the current year.
3096,1985-86,External assistance net of repayments is estimated at Rs 2510 crores compared with Rs 2146 crores in the current year.
3097,1985-86,"Taking into account these and other variations in the receipts, the total receipts in 198586 are estimated at Rs 47,635 crores."
3098,1985-86,These receipts take into account the effect of revision of Railway fares and freights.
3099,1985-86,"Total expenditure is placed at Rs 51,295 crores."
3100,1985-86,"The overall budgetary gap at existing rates of taxation will thus be Rs 3,660 crores."
3101,1985-86,"The formulation of the Budget is an annual exercise but, to be meaningful, it has to be set in a longer time frame."
3102,1985-86,Our fiscal system has served us well.
3103,1985-86,"However, over the years, objective conditions have changed calling for new responses."
3104,1985-86,"I am quite aware that it is not possible to usher in all the changes at one stroke, yet we have to initiate a process of reform which can be completed in a phased manner in a time bound frame."
3105,1985-86,We will be moving towards the formulation of a longterm fiscal policy coterminous with the Plan.
3106,1985-86,I hope to initiate a debate on this after the budget session is over.
3107,1985-86,"In the area of direct taxes, an important priority is to create an environment for growth, productivity and savings."
3108,1985-86,"The system of direct taxation which can help in achieving these objectives will also secure better tax compliance, and will be more equitable."
3109,1985-86,Our approach to the reform of the personal incometax is as follows.
3110,1985-86,"First, the rates of personal incometax should be recast and rationalised with a view to making the structure simple and reasonable."
3111,1985-86,"While maintaining the progressivity of the tax structure, it needs to be ensured that the combined effect of the rates of taxes on personal income and wealth are not counterproductive."
3112,1985-86,"Second, the exemption limit should be so fixed as to eliminate a large number of small assessments and to provide relief to low and middle income groups."
3113,1985-86,"Third, the tax structure should be stable."
3114,1985-86,"Fourth, in order to make more effective use of the administrative machinery in reducing tax evasion, the emphasis in tax assessments should shift from routine examination of a very large number of returns to a thorough scrutiny of a sample of cases."
3115,1985-86,"Fifth, it must be ensured that when tax evasion is detected, the penalties are swift and severe."
3116,1985-86,"Sixth, a tax, however laudable in intent, should have no place in the statute book if it has outlived its utility."
3117,1985-86,"The statutory rate of corporate tax in India is high, but because of various exemptions, the effective rate is significantly lower."
3118,1985-86,"While each exemption has a rationale, the combined effect of all these exemptions, taken together, is to erode the tax base."
3119,1985-86,The present system also affects different taxpayers very differently.
3120,1985-86,"This cumbersome system has led to unending litigation, and has given wide discretion to those who make the accounts and those who scrutinise them."
3121,1985-86,My proposals for the current year in the area of corporate taxation are designed to introduce a directional change by discontinuing certain exemptions and rationalising the rates.
3122,1985-86,"For the present, I am not going all the way partly because of revenue considerations and partly because I would like to Watch the response to the changes being proposed now."
3123,1985-86,"In order to have the benefit of the views of the Honourable Members, I shall also put forward a set of proposals regarding corporation tax which could be introduced in a phased manner in the next two years."
3124,1985-86,I believe that an open debate on these issues is necessary so that the decisions that we take are the right ones.
3125,1985-86,I propose to announce Government’s decisions in this regard in my reply to the debate on the finance Bill so that there is no uncertainty in the matter.
3126,1985-86,"In respect of indirect taxes, my immediate task is to bring about changes which would help in reducing costs of investment in priority sectors, encourage the growth of the smallscale sector and remove certain other distortions."
3127,1985-86,"During the course of the year, I shall be giving consideration to other changes that might be required for the indirect tax system to make its full contribution to the further development of our economy."
3128,1985-86,"I should make it clear that the Government is determined to pursue its socioeconomic goals without fear or favour, and those who continue to indulge in tax evasion or other economic offences will do so at their peril."
3129,1985-86,Let me now come to my specific proposals.
3130,1985-86,I shall first deal with the proposals in the field of direct taxes.
3131,1985-86,"I propose to raise the exemption limit for personal income taxation from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000."
3132,1985-86,"As a result, out of about 40 lakh assessees, around 10 lakh will not have to pay any incometax."
3133,1985-86,I also propose to restructure the rate schedule for personal incomes.
3134,1985-86,"After the nil rate slab of Rs 18,000, the rate of incometax on the slab of Rs 18,001 to Rs 25,000 will be 25 per cent; on the slab of Rs 25,001 to Rs 50,000, the rate will be 30 per cent; on the slab of Rs 50,001 to Rs 1 lakh, the rate will be 40 per cent; and on the income in excess of Rs 1 lakh, the rate will be 50 per cent."
3135,1985-86,The new rate schedule will result in a reduction in tax at all levels of income.
3136,1985-86,"On a taxable income of Rs 20,000, the tax relief under the new rate schedule will be 50 per cent of the incometax at Current rates; on a taxable income of Rs 25,000, the relief will be 22 per cent; on a taxable income of Rs 50,000 the relief will be 18 per cent and on an income of Rs 1 lakh, the relief will be 17 per cent."
3137,1985-86,"With the reduction in the tax rate slabs from eight to four, the rate schedule will also stand simplified."
3138,1985-86,The rate schedule applicable to Hindu undivided families having one or more members with separate incomes exceeding the exemption limit is also proposed to be consequently restructured.
3139,1985-86,I also propose to discontinue the surcharge on incometax in the case of all categories of noncorporate taxpayers.
3140,1985-86,"With the proposed modifications, the maximum marginal rate of income tax on personal incomes will stand reduced from 61.875 per cent to 50 per cent in fact, the average rate of tax would be even lower."
3141,1985-86,"The calculated loss of revenue, during the financial year 198586, due to the proposed rationalisation of the tax structure is Rs 200 crores on account of income tax and Rs 197 crores on account of surcharge."
3142,1985-86,"However, taking into account the better compliance as a result of reduction of tax rates, the actual loss is estimated at Rs 197 crores and that too in respect of surcharge."
3143,1985-86,This entire loss will be to the account of the Centre.
3144,1985-86,"In fulfilment of the promise made in our Election Mainifesto, the scheme of compulsory deposits by incometax payers is being abolished with effect from 1st April 1985."
3145,1985-86,"However, keeping in view the overall ways and means position, I propose to provide that repayments of instalments in respect of earlier deposits and payment of interest due in the financial year 198586 would be postponed by one year."
3146,1985-86,The unpaid amount will continue to earn interest and shall be repaid in the financial year 198687 along with instalments due for repayment in that year.
3147,1985-86,I propose to introduce a separate bill for this purpose this evening.
3148,1985-86,"The structure of wealthtax has been examined by a number of high powered bodies, including the Estimates Committee and the Public Accounts Committee of Parliament."
3149,1985-86,A number of suggestions have been made by them for making the system of wealthtax more conducive to the promotion of savings and investment in 16 the economy.
3150,1985-86,"The present basic exemption limit of Rs  1,50,000 has also been considered to be inadequate in view of the rise in prices."
3151,1985-86,It may be recalled that a limit of Rs 1 lakh had been set as early as 1964.
3152,1985-86,"Taking these considerations into account, I propose to raise the wealthtax exemption limit to Rs 2,50,000 and to provide a nil rate slab in respect of net wealth up to Rs 2,50,000, I also propose to restructure the wealthtax rate schedule."
3153,1985-86,"Under the new rate schedule, the rate of wealthtax on the slab of Rs 2,50,001 to Rs 10,00,000 will be 1/2 per cent; on the slab from Rs 10,00,001 to Rs 20,00,000, the rate will be 1 per eerie and on the slab over Rs 20,00,000, the rate will be 2 per cent."
3154,1985-86,"The maximum marginal rate will, therefore, stand reduced from 5 per cent to 2 per cent."
3155,1985-86,I also propose to restructure the rate schedule applicable to Hindu undivided families having one or more members with independent wealth exceeding the exemption limit.
3156,1985-86,The value of one house is exempt from wealthtax upto Rs 2 lakhs.
3157,1985-86,"A taxpayer is also entitled to exemption from wealthtax in respect of specified assets up to an aggregate value of Rs 2,65,000."
3158,1985-86,"An additional exemption of Rs 35,000 is allowed in respect of units of the Unit Trust of India and deposits under the National Deposit Scheme."
3159,1985-86,"I propose to replace the separate exemption limits, aggregating Rs 5 lakhs, by a consolidated exemption limit of Rs 5 lakhs in respect of all these assets."
3160,1985-86,My proposals relating to wealthtax would not result in any loss during the financial year 198586.
3161,1985-86,"Although the estimated loss during the financial year 1986 87 is Rs 70 crores, I expect that, due to improved compliance, there would be no loss of revenue over a period."
3162,1985-86,"As both wealthtax and estate duty laws apply to the property of a person, the former applying to his property before death and the latter after his death, the existence of two separate laws with reference to the same property amounts to procedural harassment to the taxpayers and the heirs of the deceased who have to comply with the provisions of two different laws."
3163,1985-86,"Having considered the relative merits of the two taxes, I am of die view that estate duty has not achieved the twin objectives with which it was introduced, namely, to reduce unequal distribution of wealth and assist the States in financing their development schemes."
3164,1985-86,"While the yield from estate duty is only about Rs 20 crores, its cost of administration is relatively high."
3165,1985-86,"I, therefore, propose to abolish the levy of estate duty in respect of estates passing on deaths occurring on or after 16th March, 1985."
3166,1985-86,I will come forward in due course with suitable legislation for this purpose.
3167,1985-86,"Earlier in my speech, I referred to certain measures that the Government proposes to take for the benefit of industrial and other workers."
3168,1985-86,"These include the proposals to give worker’s dues the same priority as secured creditors in the event of closure of companies, the proposed increase in the bonus limit, and the introduction of a stock option scheme for exployees and workers."
3169,1985-86,"With the raising of the exemption, limit for personal taxation most of the industrial workers will not be required to pay 17 any incometax."
3170,1985-86,"As a measure of further relief to them, I propose to raise the monetary ceilling on the exempt amount of retrenchment compensation received by them from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000."
3171,1985-86,I also propose to provide that retrenchment compensation paid under schemes approved by the Central Government will be exempt from tax in full.
3172,1985-86,"I may also inform Honourable Members that the Government is giving consideration to the formulation of a scheme for encouraging industry to involve workers in management and, if necessary, suitable fiscal incentives will be provided for this purpose."
3173,1985-86,"Under a provision made by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1984, salaried taxpayers are chargeable to tax on the perquisite represented by interestfree loans or loans at concessional rates of interest provided by their employers for certain purposes."
3174,1985-86,"As a measure of further relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to repeal this provision."
3175,1985-86,"With a view to providing further encouragement for indigenous scientific research, I propose to provide that lump sum consideration received by scientists for the knowhow developed by them would be spread over a period of three years and charged to tax accordingly."
3176,1985-86,I also propose to provide that industry may write off the lump sum consideration paid for acquiring knowhow in six annual instalments.
3177,1985-86,"In cases where the knowhow has been developed in Government laboratories, Universities, laboratories owned by public sector companies and other recognised institutions, the write off would be permitted over a period of three years."
3178,1985-86,"Authors of University level text books, dictionaries, etc. in Hindi and other Indian languages are entitled to a deduction of 25 per cent of the income by way of royalty, copyright fees, etc. derived by them in respect of such books."
3179,1985-86,This concession is coming to an end with the current assessment year.
3180,1985-86,"In order to encourage the writing of such books, I propose to continue this concession for another five years."
3181,1985-86,I propose to place donations to the Indira Gandhi Memorial Trust at par with donations to other funds of national importance.
3182,1985-86,"I also propose to provide that donations to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund will qualify for 100 per cent deduction, as against the deduction of only 50 per cent allowed at present."
3183,1985-86,"In the context of the need to bring tax evaders to book, I see little justification for providing immunity from the penal provisions to those who make a disclosure only after incriminating books of account and assets in their possession have been seized by the Incometax Department."
3184,1985-86,"I, therefore, propose to remove the provisions made by the Taxation Laws Amendment Act, 1984 for the grant of immunity from penal provisions in such cases."
3185,1985-86,I also propose to enter into a dialogue with State Governments and other authorities with a view to setting up special courts empowered to try tax evaders in respect of criminal proceedings initiated against them.
3186,1985-86,"As a measure for countering tax avoidance, I propose to plug an existing lacuna in section 167A of the Incometax Act by providing that an association of persons shall be charged to incometax at the maximum marginal rate if the individual shares of the members, in even a part of its income, are indeterminate or unknown."
3187,1985-86,"Under a provision made by the Finance Act, 1933, business profits derived by charitable and religious trusts are not exempt from incometax, except in certain cases."
3188,1985-86,"Conformably with this provision, I propose to provide that exemption from wealthtax will also not be available in respect of business assets of such trusts."
3189,1985-86,I shall now deal with the proposals relating to corporation tax.
3190,1985-86,"For the financial year 198586, I propose to reduce the basic rate of income tax applicable to companies by 5 percentage points."
3191,1985-86,"At present, closelyheld industrial companies are charged to tax at a lower rate than that applicable to other closelyheld companies."
3192,1985-86,"In the result, the basic rate of incometax in the case of certain categories of closelyheld companies will stand reduced by 10 percentage points, from 65 per cent to 55 per cent."
3193,1985-86,"This will particularly benefit companies carrying on employmentoriented activities, such as, consultancy and advertising services and services for promotion of tourism."
3194,1985-86,"The proposed reduction in tax rates, both for the corporate and non corporate sectors, would have to go hand in hand with the discontinuance of certain concessions."
3195,1985-86,"Under a provision made in 1980, additional depreciation is granted in respect of machinery and plant installed during the fiveyear period, from I st April, 1980 to 3 1 st March, 1985."
3196,1985-86,"In the context of the proposed reduction in the rates of tax and the increase in the general rate of depreciation allowance, from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, with effect from the current assessment year, I do not consider it necessary to continue the grant of additional depreciation in respect of machinery and plant installed after 31st March, 1985."
3197,1985-86,"Under an existing provision, expenditure incurred by companies and co operative societies on approved programmes of rural development is deducted in computing their taxable profits."
3198,1985-86,"While the objective is laudable, a fiscal concession is not the right instrument to achieve this objective."
3199,1985-86,"I, therefore, propose to discontinue this concession, except in relation to programmes which have been approved by the prescribed authority before 17th March, 1985."
3200,1985-86,"The tax exemption allowed in respect of profits derived from the publication of books, which would lapse with the assessment year 198586, is not proposed to be continued."
3201,1985-86,I also propose to withdraw the tax concession in respect of dividends received by Indian companies from certain foreign companies.
3202,1985-86,"The tax holiday concession is at present available in respect of industrial undertakings that go into production before 1st April, 1985; hotels which start 19 functioning and ships which are brought into use before that date are also eligible for this concession."
3203,1985-86,I propose to extend this concession for a further period of 5 years.
3204,1985-86,"It is necessary to provide our exporters with requisite resources for modernisation, technological upgradation, product development and other activities with a view to raising their efficiency and productivity, not only in the export sector but also in the economy as a whole."
3205,1985-86,"In view of these considerations, I propose to replace the tax concession under section 80HHC of the Incometax Act by a new provision."
3206,1985-86,"Under the new provision, exporters will be entitled to a deduction of an amount, not exceeding 50 per cent of their export profits, carried to a reserve account to be utilised for the purposes of their business."
3207,1985-86,"To facilitate the mobilisation of internal resources by the tea industry for purposes of investment in new machinery, fresh planting and replanting etc."
3208,1985-86,I propose to provide that companies engaged in the business of growing and manufacturing tea in India would be entitled to a deduction up to 20 per cent of their profits deposited in a special account with the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development Withdrawals from this account would be allowed only for specified purposes in accordance with schemes to be approved by the Tea Board.
3209,1985-86,"With a view to leaving larger funds with banks for meeting their increasing social commitments, I propose to discontinue interesttax in relation to interest accruing after 31st March, 1985."
3210,1985-86,"I also propose to provide that banks may make tax deductible provisions for their bad and doubtful debts up to an amount equal to 10 per cent of the profits or 2 per cent of the aggregate average advances made by their rural branches, whichever is higher."
3211,1985-86,"I also propose to discontinue the provisions relating to disallowance of 20 per cent of the expenditure, in excess of Rs 1,00,000, on advertisement, publicity and sales promotion; running and maintenance of aircraft and motor cars; and payments made to hotels."
3212,1985-86,The provision relating to the disallowance of 15 per cent of the interest paid by nonbanking nonfinancial companies on the public deposits raised by them is also proposed to be discontinued.
3213,1985-86,"Taking into account the effect of withdrawal of some of the axisting concessions and expected collections on account of the recent Supreme Court judgement regarding section 80J of the Incometax Act, loss of revenue in 198586 due to my proposals in respect of relief in tax on corporate sector will be more than offset."
3214,1985-86,The other modifications proposed by me in the sphere of direct taxes are of relatively minor importance.
3215,1985-86,I would not like to take the time of the House by elaborating them at this stage.
3216,1985-86,I will not come to my proposals relating to the phased reform of corporation tax to which I made a reference in the earlier part of my speech.
3217,1985-86,The scheme envisages that next year the basic rate of incometax in the case of all categories of companies would be further reduced by 5 percentage points.
3218,1985-86,"In the third year, I propose to discontinue the surcharge on incometax payable by companies and to abolish surtax."
3219,1985-86,"At the same time, I propose to discontinue the grant of investment allowance in a phased manner during the next two years."
3220,1985-86,"While withdrawal of investment allowance may have an adverse effect on highgrowth capital intensive industries, the general reduction in corporation tax would lead to higher retained profits which would benefit all companies."
3221,1985-86,The alternative to the above proposal is to continue the investment allowance with no further reduction in the rates of corporation tax and surcharge.
3222,1985-86,I shall be grateful for the comments of the Hon’ble Members.
3223,1985-86,I now turn to my proposals on the indirect taxes.
3224,1985-86,"Taking customs duties first, my principal proposals is with regard to crude petroleum."
3225,1985-86,"Honourable Members will recall that in the last year’s Budget, auxiliary duty on crude petroleum was raised from Rs 9.50 to Rs 100 per tonne."
3226,1985-86,I propose to increase it to Rs 300 per tonne.
3227,1985-86,I also propose to levy.on crude petroleum a basic customs duty of 10 per cent ad valorem.
3228,1985-86,The revenue yield from these proposals is estimated to be Rs 620 crores in a full year.
3229,1985-86,"Taking this and other factors into account, there will be an increase in the price of P 0 L products."
3230,1985-86,"In other cases, I propose to continue the auxiliary duty at the existing rates upto the 31st March, 1986."
3231,1985-86,"As a measure of protection to the indigenous bearings industry, I propose to increase the basic customs duty on ball and roller bearings by 50 per cent of the existing rates."
3232,1985-86,This will result in a revenue gain of about Rs 20 crores in a year.
3233,1985-86,"Over the years, the rate of duty applicable to project imports has gone up and reached the level of 65 per cent."
3234,1985-86,"With a view to bringing down capital costs, I propose to reduce the present customs duty of 65 per cent applicable to project imports in general to 45 per cent ad valorem and to provide for a lower rate of 25 per cent to imports for power projects and total exemption from duty for equipment for fertiliser projects."
3235,1985-86,I propose to extend the concessional project imports rate of 45 per cent ad valorem to the public telephone exchange network project.
3236,1985-86,These measures will totally cost the exchequer Rs 290 crores in a year.
3237,1985-86,"Honourable Members will recall that in the last year’s Budget, customs duty on imported wood pulp and wood chips for the paper industry was reduced to 30 per cent and nil, respectively."
3238,1985-86,"As a measure to relieve the pressure on our forest resources, I now propose to totally exempt imported pulp and wood chips and make this concession available to all user industries."
3239,1985-86,Customs duty on wood in certain specified forms is also proposed to be reduced from the existing level of 100 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem.
3240,1985-86,These concessions would entail a revenue sacrifice of about Rs 17.70 crores in a full year.
3241,1985-86,Not all the proposals in my basket qualify to be described as crude or wooden.
3242,1985-86,"To encourage alternative sources of energy, I propose to provide for total exemption from customs duty in respect of wind operated electricity generators and wind operated battery chargers."
3243,1985-86,I also propose to reduce customs duty on exhaust gas analysers and smoke meters in order to help enforce antipollution norms.
3244,1985-86,The revenue effect of these concessions will be Rs 7.54 crores.
3245,1985-86,I now propose a set of measures aimed at export promotion.
3246,1985-86,"I am abolishing the export duties on twelve items which comprise iron ore, managanese ore, raw cotton, chromite ore and concentrate, cotton waste, animal feed, manganese dioxide, deoiled groundnut oilcake, raw wool, kyanite and bridge mica."
3247,1985-86,"With this abolition, export duty will now be leviable only on four items, namely, coffee, unmanufactured tobacco, mica other than bridge mica and hides and skins."
3248,1985-86,Revenue implication of this proposal is Rs 15.05 crores.
3249,1985-86,"Keeping in view the potential of the leather industry in the field of exports, I am presenting a package of proposals relating to this industry."
3250,1985-86,"I propose to reduce customs duties on specified machinery used for leather processing, footwear and other leather goods manufacturing industries, from the general level of 8 1.5 per cent to 35 per cent ad valorem."
3251,1985-86,"I propose to fully exempt raw hides and skins, crust leather and finished cattle leather from import duty."
3252,1985-86,The existing exemption on wet blue leather is also being made available on a long term basis.
3253,1985-86,The import duty on wattle extract used by the leather processing industry is being reduced from 87 per cent to 40 per cent ad valorem.
3254,1985-86,The proposals involve a revenue sacrifice of Rs 20.07 crores in a year.
3255,1985-86,"Some concessions were given in the last Budget and in January, 1985 on imports of gem and jewellery machinery."
3256,1985-86,I now propose to extend the concession to certain components of gem and jewellery machinery and to some essential tools for operating them.
3257,1985-86,The revenue effect of this proposal is Rs 53 lakhs.
3258,1985-86,I also propose to continue the concessions given in the last Budget in respect of specified items of machinery for food and meat processing and packaging.
3259,1985-86,"In order to give relief to the woollen textile industry, I propose to reduce customs duty on raw wool from 50 per cent to 40 per cent ad valorem."
3260,1985-86,This relief will cost the exchequer Rs 4.80 crores in a year.
3261,1985-86,"Honourable Members would recall that a few months ago, Government had extended a concessional rate of customs duty of 45 per cent in respect of components to be imported for the manufacture of fuel efficient commercial vehicles under a phased manufacturing programme."
3262,1985-86,I propose to extend this conession to warranty spares for such vehicles.
3263,1985-86,In order to help indigenisation.
3264,1985-86,The concession is proposed to be extended to components of fuel injection pumps and warranty spares imported by 22 manufacturers of fuel injection pumps.
3265,1985-86,"Together, these concessions will cost the exchequer Rs 24.7 crores in a year."
3266,1985-86,I propose to totally exempt from customs duties certain advanced type of computers not manufactured in the country.
3267,1985-86,"Simultaneously, customs duty on four important components of computers is being further reduced from 75 per cent to 25 per cent ad valorem with a view to reducing the costs of the indigenous manufacturer of computers."
3268,1985-86,These proposals would involve a revenue sacrifice of Rs 20.40 crores.
3269,1985-86,The demand of health and medical care has not escaped my attention.
3270,1985-86,"I propose to reduce the duty on certain important items of medical equipment such as Nuclear,Mapetic Resonance Scanner, CAT Scanner and Linear Accelerator, to 45 per cent ad valorem."
3271,1985-86,"Three specified intermediates used in the manufacture of the anti T.B. and antiLeprosy drug, Rifampicin, are being totally exempted from import duty."
3272,1985-86,I also propose to reduce the customs duty on eight other drug intermediates as also on homoeopathic medicines.
3273,1985-86,The revenue effect of these concessions is Rs 14.09 crores.
3274,1985-86,"Government has already exempted from the levy of customs duty scientific and technical instruments, apparatus and appliances imported by research institutions subject to certain conditions."
3275,1985-86,"As a measure of further encouragement to research in the country, I propose to exempt from customs duty consumable items of research materials to be imported by publicfunded research institutions upto a value of Rs 50,000/ in a year."
3276,1985-86,This would entail a revenue sacrifice of about Rs 2.5 crores in a year.
3277,1985-86,"In order to encourage domestic production of zip fasteners and discourage their smuggling, I propose to fully exempt zip fasteners from excise duty."
3278,1985-86,This is in keeping with the other measures taken by me in this direction.
3279,1985-86,"Honourable Members will recall that recently the import duty on watch components, horological machines and raw materials was reduced, as also the excise duty on watches."
3280,1985-86,This measure will cost the exchequer Rs 3.07 crores.
3281,1985-86,"In this context, the Honourable Members are aware of the various measures being taken by Government to tighten the implementation of antismuggling measures."
3282,1985-86,We have also recently announced a liberalised scheme of rewards and incentives in this connection.
3283,1985-86,"I hope Honourable Members of the House will help to create a vibrant public opinion which alone, in the ultimate analysis, can help to reduce and eliminate the antinational activities of smugglers."
3284,1985-86,"With a view to giving encouragement to our sportsmen winning awards in events of international significance, we have evolved a scheme by which they are given suitable concessions in respect of taxes due on the awards."
3285,1985-86,"Certain changes in the Customs Tariff Act, 1975 are also proposed."
3286,1985-86,The details of these proposals are in the Budget papers.
3287,1985-86,"Before I deal with my proposals in respect of excise duties, there is one matter which I would like to mention."
3288,1985-86,"It relates to the recommendation of the Eighth Finance Commission that there was scope for increasing the rates of stamp duty on bills of lading, letters of credit and general insurance policies."
3289,1985-86,I accordingly propose to raise the rates of stamp duty on the instruments of bills of lading and letters of credit.
3290,1985-86,"I propose, however, not to disturb the existing rates of stamp duty on general insurance policies."
3291,1985-86,"The new rates of duties would be effective only from the 1st July, 1985."
3292,1985-86,The accrual of additional revenue to the States and the Union territories during the next financial year would be Rs 12.24 crores.
3293,1985-86,"Coming now to the excise duties, let me begin with my proposals for additional resource mobilisation."
3294,1985-86,The rate of duty in respect of item 68 of the excise tariff is being raised from the existing level of 10 per cent to 12 per cent.
3295,1985-86,This is likely to yield an additional revenue of Rs 125 crores by way of central excise duties and Rs 60 crores by way of countervailing duty in a full year.
3296,1985-86,"I must hasten to add that this increase will not affect the raw materials and manufactured inputs which are intermediates, as the existing provisions for the set off of the duty paid on goods falling under item 68 used in the manufacture of other excisable goods, would continue."
3297,1985-86,The excise duty on vegetable product which has been at a low level of 5 per cent for over 15 years is being raised to 10 per cent.
3298,1985-86,This measure would fetch in a full year additional revenue of Rs 70 crores.
3299,1985-86,The basic excise duty on cement is being raised from Rs 205 per MT to Rs 225 per MT for the common varieties of cement.
3300,1985-86,This will result in an additional revenue gain of Rs 66 crores on the excise side and Rs 1.60 crores on the customs side by way of increase in the countervailing duty.
3301,1985-86,Four new items are being introduced in the Excise tariff which will yield additional revenue of Rs 19 crores in a year.
3302,1985-86,"The first three items are marble blocks, slabs and tiles, travel goods and organicchemicals."
3303,1985-86,"The last item is a preparation containing betel nuts and any one or more of other ingredients such as lime, catechu, cardamom, copra and menthol, put up for sale in unit containers’."
3304,1985-86,Honourable Members will recognize this ‘coalition’ as pan masala.
3305,1985-86,The extent of duty differential enjoyed by mini steel plants is being reduced.
3306,1985-86,"However, they will still have a duty advantage of Rs 50/ per MT."
3307,1985-86,This measure is expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 18 crores in a full year.
3308,1985-86,I propose to increase the basic excise duty on aerated waters from 25 paise to 30 paise per bottle of 200 ml.
3309,1985-86,There will be proportionate increase for bottles of higher capacity.
3310,1985-86,I also propose to increase the basic duty on crown corks from 2 paise to 5 paise per 24 unit.
3311,1985-86,These proposals are expected to yield an additional revenue of about Rs 16.75 crores in a full year.
3312,1985-86,"As a measure aimed at reducing evasion, I propose to provide for purely specific rates of duty in respect of flat glass."
3313,1985-86,I also propose to rationalise the tariff structure relating to glass.
3314,1985-86,These measures will result in a revenue gain of Rs 12.5 crores.
3315,1985-86,"I propose to raise the basic excise duty on printing and writing paper and kraft paper, of specified varieties, by Rs 200/per MT."
3316,1985-86,The revenue gain from these measures will be Rs 10.50 crores.
3317,1985-86,"I propose to raise the total duty on biris from Rs 3.74 to Rs 4 per thousand, on metal jacketed batteries from 20 per cent to 25 per cent ad valorem, and on storage batteries from 15 per cent to 20 per cent."
3318,1985-86,These measures are expected to result in a revenue gain of Rs 16.84 crores.
3319,1985-86,My next few proposals are rationalisation measures.
3320,1985-86,The concessional rates applicable to veneer matches are being extended to cardboard matches produced in the nonmechanised sector.
3321,1985-86,The differential rates of duty for use of cardboard in matches in the mechanised sector are dispensed with.
3322,1985-86,"There will be only four rates of duty, namely, Rs 1.60, Rs 4.50, Rs 5.15, and Rs 6.85 per gross boxes as against the multiplicity of rates prevailing now."
3323,1985-86,I hope this measure will result in greater use of cardboard in place of wood in the nonmechanised sector.
3324,1985-86,"In the case of household, laundry and toilet soaps, duty rates depending only on the value of the soap are being prescribed."
3325,1985-86,"The present limit of Rs 7,800 per tonne for qualifying for the lower rate of duty is being raised to Rs 10,000 per tonne."
3326,1985-86,"All soaps of value below Rs 10,000 per MT will be charged to concessional duty of 5 percent and other higher priced soaps will be charged to 15 per cent advalorem."
3327,1985-86,There will be an incidental revenue gain of about Rs 1 crore from this measure.
3328,1985-86,"In respect of gases and tubes and flaps of tyres, the present ad valorem levies are being converted into specific rates to simplify the assessment procedures."
3329,1985-86,"I have also included in the Finance Bill some provisions designed to achieve rationalisation, simplification and clarity in the tariff nomenclature in respect of cosmetics and toilet preparations, iron and steel and nonferrous metals."
3330,1985-86,This measure in the case of cosmetics and toilet preparations is estimated to result in a revenue gain of about Rs 5 crores.
3331,1985-86,"There are certain other minor proposals with not much revenue significance, which include revision of rates of duty in some cases and readjustment of duties."
3332,1985-86,My next two proposals are a measure of simplification as well as relief.
3333,1985-86,The first relates to special excise duty.
3334,1985-86,"This duty, as Honourable Members are aware, 25 is levied as a percentage of the basic excise duty, the maximum being 10 per cent."
3335,1985-86,The present system entails maintenance of separate account in respect of this levy.
3336,1985-86,"As a first step towards abolition of special excise duty, I propose to exempt as many as 100 items from this levy merging the special excise duty in some cases with the basic duty."
3337,1985-86,Only 32 items will now be subject to this levy.
3338,1985-86,This measure will cost the exchequer Rs 38.20 crores.
3339,1985-86,"The second proposal regarding simplification concerns the licence fee on television sets, VCRs and radios."
3340,1985-86,"While the requirement of taking out a licence in the case of radios, television sets and VCRs is being dispensed with, a new onetime levy is being introduced on television sets alone at a uniform rate of Rs 100 per set in lieu of the present Licence fee of Rs 50 payable every year till the T.V. set lasts."
3341,1985-86,"Hence forth, people will not have to go to the post offices for taking out or renewing licences."
3342,1985-86,"This levy would be an additional duty of excise, so far as T.V. sets manufactured in India are concerned."
3343,1985-86,The additional duty of excise collected from this will accrue to the Centre only and will not be shareable with the States.
3344,1985-86,Additional duty of customs on equal amount would be levied on television sets when imported into India.
3345,1985-86,The collection on this account is expected to be Rs 18 crores in a year on the excise side and Rs 2 crores on the customs side.
3346,1985-86,I Now I come to my proposals regarding textiles.
3347,1985-86,I propose to partly shift the cotton fabrics duty to the yarn stage.
3348,1985-86,Unprocessed cotton fabrics are being fully exempted and duty burden on cotton yearn is being increased generally by about 25 per cent.
3349,1985-86,"However, cotton yarn in straight reel banks which is generally used by handlooms will continue to be exempted."
3350,1985-86,"The concessional rates for yam in cross reel hanks supplied to registered handloom cooperative societies, are also being continued."
3351,1985-86,"Power processing of fabrics, whether in composite mills or elsewhere, will now attract the same processing stage duty generally at a lower rate."
3352,1985-86,"While lowering the overall rate, 1 have taken care to ensure that the additional duty component collected in lieu of sales tax which goes to the States is increased."
3353,1985-86,Exemption enjoyed by hand processors is being continued.
3354,1985-86,So also the exemption to handloom fabrics processed by approved independent processors and registered handloom cooperative societies is being continued.
3355,1985-86,I also propose to fully exempt shoddy woollen blankets.
3356,1985-86,Excise duty on certain poIyesterwool blended fabrics is also being reduced.
3357,1985-86,My proposals on excise duties relating to textiles would result in a revenue loss of about Rs 13.85 crores in a full year.
3358,1985-86,"As Honourable Members are aware, substantial concessions in customs duty have been accorded in the last two years to the electronics industry keeping in view the growth potential of this industry."
3359,1985-86,"I have already referred to the concessions in customs duty, in respect of computers."
3360,1985-86,I propose to completely exempt computers 26 from excise duty.
3361,1985-86,I have also attempted to rationalise the existing excise tariff structure in respect of different electronic items.
3362,1985-86,"In order to simplify assessment of excise duty on television sets, I propose to fix specific rates of duty relatable to the size of the T.V. screen."
3363,1985-86,"While doing so, I am also exempting from excise duty black and white television sets of screen size not exceeding 36 cms."
3364,1985-86,I These proposals will cost the exchequer Rs 7.72 crores in a year.
3365,1985-86,I propose to increase the basic excise duty on commercial vehicles from 10 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem and on threeaxled vehicles from 7.5 per cent to 10 per cent ad valorem.
3366,1985-86,This would yield about Rs 45 crores in a year.
3367,1985-86,"However, I propose to provide for credit of the duty paid on tyres and batteries used in the manufacture of all commercial vehicles including threeaxled vehicles."
3368,1985-86,I also propose to allow a reduction of duty by 2 percentage points in respect of commercial vehicles if such vehicles are turbocharged.
3369,1985-86,This concession will also be extended to passenger cars if they are turbocharged.
3370,1985-86,These two proposals will cost the exchequer Rs 82 crores in a year.
3371,1985-86,"The net loss of revenue would, therefore, be Rs 37 crores."
3372,1985-86,I hope these measures would help manufacturers to reduce the prices of commercial vehicles.
3373,1985-86,"Honourable Members would recall that in the 1982 Budget, full exemption was given to duplex paper board intended for lamination with low density polyethylene and intended for packaging of milk."
3374,1985-86,"I propose to extend the concession to all varieties of paper and paper board intended for lamination with low density polyethylene, which should help in better utilisation and marketing of milk."
3375,1985-86,I also propose to fully exempt accessories of cycles and leather board from excise duty.
3376,1985-86,These measures will entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 2. 10 crores in a full year.
3377,1985-86,My last proposal relates to the excise duty exemption for the small scale sector.
3378,1985-86,"As the Honourable Members are aware, the excise duty mechanism has been used to encourage the growth of this sector."
3379,1985-86,"Under the present general scheme relating to 67 specified groups of commodities, full exemption is available upto first clearances of Rs 7.5 lakhs and clearances thereafter upto Rs 25 lakhs are charged to duty at 75 per cent of the duty otherwise payable."
3380,1985-86,"However, a unit whose clearances had exceeded Rs 25 lakhs in the preceding financial year is not eligible for the concession."
3381,1985-86,"In order to see that the cutoff limit of Rs 25 lakhs does not inhibit the growth of the small scale sector, I propose to raise the eligibility limit to Rs 75 lakhs."
3382,1985-86,I also propose to further liberalise the scheme by providing for slab rates.
3383,1985-86,"For clearances between Rs 7.5 lakhs and Rs 15 lakhs the rate will be 25 per cent, for clearances between Rs 15 lakhs and Rs 25 lakhs the rate will be 50 per cent and for clearances between Rs 25 lakhs and Rs 40 lakhs the rate will be 75 per cent, of the duty otherwise payable."
3384,1985-86,A similar scheme with some modifications is being introduced in respect of goods falling under item 68.
3385,1985-86,My proposals relating to the small scale sector entail a revenue sacrifice of Rs 20 crores.
3386,1985-86,My proposals in respect of customs and excise duties outlined above are likely to yield additional revenue of Rs 707 crores from customs duties and Rs 424.29 crores from excise duties.
3387,1985-86,The concessions and reliefs aggregate Rs 419.88 crores on the customs side and Rs 164.75 crores on the excise side.
3388,1985-86,The net additional revenue from customs duties thus would be Rs 287.12 crores and that from excise duties Rs 259.54 crores.
3389,1985-86,"In the excise duties, the Centre’s share would be Rs 139.59 crores and that of the States Rs 119.95 crores."
3390,1985-86,The Centre’s shares includes a sum of Rs 18 crores on account of additional excise duty on television sets.
3391,1985-86,I would like to mention that the States’ share has been calculated at the rate of 45 per cent of the net proceeds from basic excise duties and that steps have been taken to increase the incidence of additional duty in lieu of sales tax.
3392,1985-86,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from the 17th March, 1985, will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
3393,1985-86,I had earlier mentioned that the Budget deficit at the existing rates of taxes would be Rs 3660 crores.
3394,1985-86,"The proposed tax measures, taken together with reliefs and concessions, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 311 crores to the Centre and Rs 132 crores to the States during 198586."
3395,1985-86,This will leave an uncovered deficit of Rs 3349 crores.
3396,1985-86,This deficit is lower than that in the current year and is reasonable.
3397,1985-86,I am confident that various policies and measures which we have proposed will further stimulate the economy and contribute to the welfare of the common man.
3398,1985-86,"Let me end, Mr. Speaker, as I began, with the words of the late Prime Minister, Smt."
3399,1985-86,Indira Gandhi: “We all have faith in new India.
3400,1985-86,Let us put our shoulder to the wheel”.
3401,1986-87,The Budget is a powerful tool for achieving our socioeconomic goals as laid out in the Plan.
3402,1986-87,"Our Prime Minister, Shri Rajiv Gandhi, reminded us not so long ago: “Development must be accompanied by equity and social justice  by removal of social barriers that oppress the weak."
3403,1986-87,This is the essence of our concept of socialism.
3404,1986-87,These objectives have guided the formulation of this Budget.
3405,1986-87,"The economic developments in the current year have been described in detail in the Economic Survey, which was placed in the House earlier this week."
3406,1986-87,"Therefore, I will confine my remarks to a few key features of our economic performance."
3407,1986-87,This is a distinct improvement over the 3.5 per cent growth estimated for 198485.
3408,1986-87,"In contrast to the disappointing agricultural performance in 198485, when net output is estimated to have declined by 1 per cent, growth this year is anticipated to be about 3 per cent."
3409,1986-87,Food grains production had fallen to 146 million tonnes in 198485.
3410,1986-87,"Despite drought in several parts of the country, we expect food output to be about 150 million tonnes in the current year."
3411,1986-87,"After a slow start, industrial production has picked up and the rate of growth in October and November, 1985 exceeded 8 per cent."
3412,1986-87,For the financial year as a whole it is expected that the growth rate will be close to 7 per cent.
3413,1986-87,"The acceleration in growth of industrial output largely reflects higher production in the manufacturing sector, which had shown low rates of growth in the previous three years."
3414,1986-87,It is heartening that the production response to changes in industrial policy has been positive.
3415,1986-87,An important priority of the Government is to improve the functioning of the infrastructure sectors.
3416,1986-87,"I am glad to inform the House that in the first ten months, thermal power generation registered an increase of more than 15 per cent over the corresponding period of 1984."
3417,1986-87,Railway freight has also recorded a commendable increase of 9 per cent in the first eight months of this financial year.
3418,1986-87,This is double the 1 I rise to present the Budget for the year 198687.
3419,1986-87,Despatches of coal increased by 10 per cent in the first eight months.
3420,1986-87,"The increase in the Wholesale Price Index in the current year upto 8th February, 1986, was 3.4 per cent as against 5.4 per cent last year."
3421,1986-87,"Among items of particular interest to the consumer, the largest increase in wholesale prices has taken place in wheat, pulses, fruits and vegetables, eggs, fish, meat, sugar and gur."
3422,1986-87,"On the other hand, prices of rice, condiments and spices, tea, coffee and edible oils have remained stable or have actually declined."
3423,1986-87,The House will recall that the last Budget ushered in major reforms in our system of direct taxes.
3424,1986-87,"At that time, many a prophets of doom had prophesied that revenues will fall and buoyancy of the tax system, such as it was, will be further eroded."
3425,1986-87,Exactly the opposite has happened.
3426,1986-87,"Collections from major taxes have increased by 22 per cent over the previous year, which is the highest increase in a decade."
3427,1986-87,Collections have also exceeded Budget Estimates by a large margin.
3428,1986-87,What is even more pertinent is the 36 per cent increase over Budget Estimates in personal income taxes.
3429,1986-87,"In the current year, we have succeeded in reversing the declining trend in the ratio of direct taxes to GNP."
3430,1986-87,"This is a testimony to the soundness of our strategy of increasing revenue yields through a combination of reasonable rates, simpler procedures and strong enforcement of tax laws."
3431,1986-87,"We have raised more from the rich by way of incometax, and not less."
3432,1986-87,"The proof of fiscal policy is, not in empty theorising, but in the revenue that it generates."
3433,1986-87,"The Government has launched an intensive drive against smugglers, black marketeers and tax evaders."
3434,1986-87,"There cannot, and will not, be a compromise on this score."
3435,1986-87,Those who abuse the nation’s trust must be dealt with firmly and with full force of the law.
3436,1986-87,"Considerable success has already been achieved in curbing the growth of black money, and Government will spare no effort to root out this evil."
3437,1986-87,"However, I do not propose to dwell only on the strong points of our economic performance."
3438,1986-87,I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the policy issues and to seek the advice and support of this august House in coming to grips with them.
3439,1986-87,"Let me, therefore, share with you a short list of key problem areas on which we, in the Government and the Parliament, must take urgent action, both through this budget and by other means."
3440,1986-87,"The budget is now under severe pressure to meet the growing burden of expenditure on account of interest payments, defence, subsidies and assistance to States."
3441,1986-87,An important issue before us is to find sufficient resources for financing the public sector Plan.
3442,1986-87,This is not a partisan issue or the problem of a particular Government in power and I believe that a frank debate is essential for the long term economic health of our nation.
3443,1986-87,"In a nutshell, the core of the problem is simply that internal 2 generation in public sector enterprises is not measuring up to the task of financing a Plan of the size that is essential for our development."
3444,1986-87,The severity of the problem can be illustrated by the experience of the current year.
3445,1986-87,"The Seventh Plan visualises that 53 per cent of the Central Plan will be financed through resources of public enterprises, and 47 per cent will be financed through the budget."
3446,1986-87,"In the first year of the Plan, in view of the paucity of internal resources, the budget had to finance 66 per cent of the Central Plan, and not 47 per cent."
3447,1986-87,"We have been successful in increasing tax revenues sharply, and beyond Plan targets."
3448,1986-87,But higher revenues have been more than offset by increase in food and fertiliser subsidies and assistance to States.
3449,1986-87,"The higher budgetary support to the Plan, therefore, had to come from additional domestic borrowings and higher level of deficit financing."
3450,1986-87,"Collectively, we must address ourselves to the basic issue of raising resources for the Plan without fuelling the fires of inflation."
3451,1986-87,The Plan is not something abstract.
3452,1986-87,"It is more schools, more roads, more irrigation, more jobs, in a word, more development."
3453,1986-87,It embodies the hopes and aspirations of our people for a better future.
3454,1986-87,We cannot slacken our efforts to implement it fully.
3455,1986-87,Public sector has a key role in bringing about the transformation of our economic structure.
3456,1986-87,We must work hard to strengthen it.
3457,1986-87,A number of public sector units in this country are functioning very efficiently and producing surpluses for reinvestment.
3458,1986-87,"These units provide irrefutable evidence that the public sector can perform as well as the best, given the right set of circumstances."
3459,1986-87,"Unfortunately, there are also a number of public enterprises whose losses have become a drain on the resources of this nation, which could have otherwise been used for the greater benefit of the common man."
3460,1986-87,"The Government for its part will be taking steps to improve the working environment of the public sector enterprises, and improve their profitability."
3461,1986-87,"But beyond that, we must involve workers and the management in the task of revitalising the public sector."
3462,1986-87,"This, if any thing, is the need of the hour."
3463,1986-87,"We also have to find a way of reducing the nonPlan expenditure, however painful it may be."
3464,1986-87,"Subsidies serve an important social purpose, and constitute a legitimate charge on society’s resources."
3465,1986-87,"However, the question that we must ask ourselves is: how fast and how far they can be allowed to grow without cutting into resources for investment in our future."
3466,1986-87,"Food and fertilizer subsidies have now reached Rs 3,700 crores and have increased by over 40 per cent per annum in the last three years."
3467,1986-87,"Even with buoyant tax revenues, this order of increase is simply not sustainable."
3468,1986-87,"At present rates of growth, these subsidies would have reached Rs 14,000 crores by the end of the Seventh Plan."
3469,1986-87,"At this rate, total subsidies would exceed Rs 41,000 crores for the Plan period."
3470,1986-87,This is equal to the entire Central Plan for the first two years.
3471,1986-87,"To put it in another way, this amount would be sufficient to provide one deep tubewell and one primary school building in each village of the country."
3472,1986-87,The issue is what balance to strike.
3473,1986-87,The Government is initiating a process of thorough review of our expenditure policies and procedures.
3474,1986-87,"We have to cut every rupee of wasteful expenditure, get more out of every rupee of essential expenditure, and improve efficiency all round."
3475,1986-87,A full debate on what we can and must do to reduce expenditure is necessary and I would like to invite the suggestions of the Hon’ble Members on these issues.
3476,1986-87,There has been a healthy debate in the country regarding the impact of administered prices on the inflationary situation.
3477,1986-87,"When all other prices are changing, some changes in administered prices are necessary and inevitable."
3478,1986-87,But the Government accepts the view that as far as possible there is need to stabilise the prices of critical commodities.
3479,1986-87,"In order to clarify the issues involved, and to initiate an open debate on the appropriate approach, the Government will present a policy paper on administered prices to Parliament."
3480,1986-87,The balance of payments is another area of concern.
3481,1986-87,"As I had pointed out in my Budget speech last year, some of the factors that have worked in our favour in the 6th Plan will not operate with the same vigour in the 7th Plan."
3482,1986-87,"As anticipated, growth of oil production, which had shown an increase of 18 million tonnes in the 6th Plan, has slowed down."
3483,1986-87,The world environment for trade and concessional assistance continues to remain unfavourable.
3484,1986-87,"Against this background, it is essential to strengthen, further the measures to conserve scarce foreign exchange."
3485,1986-87,"In particular, we must pursue a concerted programme for energy conservation, and develop indigenous sources of energy."
3486,1986-87,"In the current year alone we are likely to pay nearly Rs 1,100 crores more for oil imports."
3487,1986-87,"The net foreign exchange outlay on this account may exceed Rs 4,600 crores as against about Rs 3,500 crores in the previous year."
3488,1986-87,"In order to overcome domestic shortages, we also had to import large quantities of sugar and edible oils."
3489,1986-87,Policy initiatives have already been taken to encourage higher domestic production of sugar and edible oils.
3490,1986-87,These have begun to yield results.
3491,1986-87,"The potential for further expansion of output of oilseeds, particularly minor oilseeds, is immense."
3492,1986-87,"Later in my speech, I propose to announce a package of incentives, which will provide support to domestic cultivators of oilseeds."
3493,1986-87,Our farmers have responded magnificently to the task of increasing yields and absorbing new technology.
3494,1986-87,"As a result of their effort, we are now selfsufficient in food grains."
3495,1986-87,"As Indiraji so rightly observed: “In a country where half the national income comes from farming, agricultural selfreliance is the basis of all selfreliance’’."
3496,1986-87,Export growth is essential to pay for our vital imports without getting into 4 debt trap.
3497,1986-87,"The international environment for our exports, however, continues to be unfavourable with the intensification of protectionist tendencies and a low rate of growth of the world economy."
3498,1986-87,This makes it all the more necessary that greater impetus 4 is given to industries which have made important contribution to our export effort.
3499,1986-87,Several step’s were taken in the last budget for export promotion.
3500,1986-87,I shall be carrying this process further in the current year’s budget.
3501,1986-87,"Separately, the Reserve Bank of India is announcing further liberalisation of preshipment credit facilities for exports."
3502,1986-87,The Government will keep external borrowings at prudent levels consistent with our debtservicing capacity.
3503,1986-87,Our record in this respect has been enviable.
3504,1986-87,And we intend to keep it that way.
3505,1986-87,"Over the past year, the Government has taken wide ranging steps to modernise the economy, accelerate industrial growth, encourage more economic scales of production, upgrade technology and promote rehabilitation of enterprises facing temporary difficulties."
3506,1986-87,"Although the full effect of these recent initiatives will take time, as I said earlier, these have already had a favourable impact on manufacturing output."
3507,1986-87,"However, overall industrial growth still remains below our full potential."
3508,1986-87,"Aside from further measures to promote overall growth in industrial output and employment, we have to devote special attention to the domestic capital goods industry."
3509,1986-87,"This industry, has been painstakingly built over decades and makes a valuable contribution to our selfreliance."
3510,1986-87,It deserves our full support.
3511,1986-87,I shall be making certain proposals in order to provide further encouragement to the growth of the capital goods industry.
3512,1986-87,"Small scale industry has played a vital role in increasing our exports, generating employment opportunities, and reducing the concentration of economic power."
3513,1986-87,It has been truly said that “great engines turn on small pivots.”
3514,1986-87,"In order to provide a focal point for coordinating financial assistance to this sector at the apex level, it is proposed to set up a separate special fund, called the Small Industries Development Fund in the IDBI."
3515,1986-87,"This Fund will also be charged with the responsibility of providing refinancing assistance for development, expansion and modernisation of small scale industry."
3516,1986-87,I also propose to announce a new scheme for excise exemption for small scale industries which should considerably facilitate their growth.
3517,1986-87,Agriculture is at the centre of our development strategy.
3518,1986-87,The quality of agricultural performance is the single most important factor in reducing the incidence of poverty in rural areas.
3519,1986-87,Through sustained and prolonged efforts we have become a surplus producer of wheat.
3520,1986-87,"But, as our heavy imports of sugar and edible oils testify, production of some important crops remains inadequate."
3521,1986-87,Correcting this imbalance in cropping pattern will ease the pressure on our balance of payments and lead to better use of our agricultural resources.
3522,1986-87,"To ensure that our approach is not ad hoc, we must work towards evolving a longer term policy, which takes full account of regional differences in yields of different crops."
3523,1986-87,"In particular, the reduction in uncertainty and instability in agricultural prices will provide more assured incomes for farmers, and thus encourage production response in desired directions."
3524,1986-87,"With a view to providing protection to farmers, last year, a comprehensive crop insurance scheme was introduced."
3525,1986-87,"This year, such a scheme will also be extended 5 to fruit cultivation."
3526,1986-87,"As a further step to reduce uncertainty, I am glad to inform the House that my colleague, the Hon’ble Minister for Agriculture, has already initiated work on the formulation of a longer term price policy for important crops in consultation with agricultural experts and scientists."
3527,1986-87,Broadbased agricultural development provides the most effective way of tackling our central problem of poverty.
3528,1986-87,"But we must also recognise that the fruits of development do not always reach the poorest sections of our society, especially in regions where agricultural development is lagging."
3529,1986-87,"For them the best hope for higher incomes and better living conditions lies with the major antipoverty programmes of Integrated Rural Development Programme, National Rural Employment Programme and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programmes."
3530,1986-87,These programmes are at the forefront of our assault on poverty and for many millions they represent the difference between the despair of destitution and the hope of gainful employment.
3531,1986-87,"In the next year’s Budget, I shall be proposing an increase of nearly 65 per cent in the allocation for these programmes."
3532,1986-87,"The programme for housing for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, announced by me last year is also being strengthened."
3533,1986-87,Many of the programmes for the welfare of the poor and the needy are the gifts of our late Prime Minister Smt.
3534,1986-87,Indira Gandhi to the nation.
3535,1986-87,It will be a fitting tribute to her memory to name the new Housing Scheme for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as INDIRA AWAAS YOJANA”.
3536,1986-87,"It is only proper that the banking system, which is the repository of peoples’ savings, should use these savings to further our national objectives, particularly in respect of poverty alleviation and rural development."
3537,1986-87,"I am glad to inform the House that in the year 1985, the advances of public sector banks to the priority sector reached 43.4 per cent as against the target of 40 per cent."
3538,1986-87,"Under the Integrated Rural Development Programme, banks have advanced loans of Rs 3,100 crores to 16.5 million persons below the poverty line during the Sixth Plan."
3539,1986-87,"In the Seventh Plan, the target Of the number of beneficiaries is 20 million."
3540,1986-87,"Of them, six million will belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."
3541,1986-87,It is also necessary to use our social banking and insurance infrastructure for tackling the problem of urban poverty.
3542,1986-87,"Rickshawpullers, cobblers, washermen, porters, barbers, hawkers, sweepers and cartpullers are among the particularly disadvantaged."
3543,1986-87,"The Government proposes to introduce a new scheme which will provide loans through the banking system with a subsidy component, so that the repayment burden on beneficiaries is effectively reduced."
3544,1986-87,The scheme will provide for purchase of equipment and loans for working capital for the selfemployed.
3545,1986-87,"Details of this scheme are being worked out in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, and will be announced separately."
3546,1986-87,I also propose to introduce a new Scheme for accident insurance for the benefit of Municipal sweepers and Railway porters.
3547,1986-87,"This scheme, the details of which will be announced separately by the Life Insurance Corporation, will provide Group Insurance through the workers’ unions."
3548,1986-87,"The Scheme will provide life insurance cover of Rs 5,000 with a double accident benefit to the members of a union, provided 75 per cent of the members agree to join the Scheme."
3549,1986-87,"In the last Budget, I had introduced a Personal Accident Insurance Social Security Scheme for the poor families in 100 districts of the country."
3550,1986-87,"As the Scheme has been widely welcomed, I propose to extend it now to 200 districts."
3551,1986-87,"The Scheme will cover the risk of death by accident in respect of earning members of poor families in rural and urban areas comprising landless labourers, small and marginal farmers, traditional craftsmen, small traders and others."
3552,1986-87,The entire cost of this scheme is borne by the Central Government.
3553,1986-87,The true asset of our country is its labour.
3554,1986-87,"It was in recognition of this that last year, I had announced a series of measures for the benefit of industrial and other workers."
3555,1986-87,"These included measures to give workers’ dues the same priority as secured creditors in the event of closure of companies, the increase in the limit on the salary or wage on which bonus is payable to employees from Rs 750 per month to Rs 1,600 per month, the introduction of a stock option scheme and increase in the monetary ceiling on the exempt amount of retrenchment compensation from Rs 20,000 to Rs 50,000."
3556,1986-87,These proposals were implemented during the year.
3557,1986-87,"In addition, the eligibility limit for bonus payments which was Rs 1,600 earlier was raised to Rs 2,500."
3558,1986-87,We have also increased the industrial D.A. for public sector employees from Rs 1.30 to Rs 1.65 per point increase in the Consumer Price Index.
3559,1986-87,It is necessary to improve the return that workers and employees earn on their hard earned savings.
3560,1986-87,"I, therefore, propose to increase the interest rate on contributions to the Provident Fund."
3561,1986-87,The rate of interest on General Provident Fund for Government employees is being raised from 10.5 per cent to 12 per cent.
3562,1986-87,"To benefit other workers covered by the Employees Provident Fund, Coal Mines Provident Fund Act and the like, interest on Provident Fund accretions invested in Special Deposits with Government is being raised from 11 per cent to 12 per cent."
3563,1986-87,The pattern of investment is also being changed to permit the funds to invest upto 85 per cent of the accretions in Special Deposits with Government as against the existing limit of 30 per cent.
3564,1986-87,I also propose to increase the interest rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent on Public Provident Fund which is intended for the selfemployed persons and those not covered by other provident fund schemes.
3565,1986-87,The expansion of housing is essential for the welfare of workers and their families.
3566,1986-87,"I, therefore, propose to considerably liberalise the depreciation provisions in respect of outlays on workers’ housing."
3567,1986-87,"Government will encourage all industrial units, large and small, to pay special attention to this area."
3568,1986-87,"The Housing and Urban 7 Development Corporation has been playing an important role in building houses for economically weaker sections, and providing housing loans at low rates of interest."
3569,1986-87,The Government will expand assistance to the weaker sections for housing.
3570,1986-87,"In view of the role of construction activity in creating employment opportunities, while meeting an important and universal social need, Government will consider suggestions for giving a boost to this activity."
3571,1986-87,We have to ensure that housing scarcity is reduced by increasing the supply and availability of houses.
3572,1986-87,"Tax concessions, which merely increase the demand for houses without increasing their supply, are unlikely to be helpful."
3573,1986-87,The Government would welcome suggestions from the Hon’ble Members and the public on this question.
3574,1986-87,"Among developing countries, India has the distinction of having one of die highest rates of savings."
3575,1986-87,This is a tribute to the habits of hard work and thrift of our people.
3576,1986-87,"An important objective of Government policy in the last few years has been to provide opportunities for investment of these savings in productive channels, particularly financial assets."
3577,1986-87,"These policies have proved remarkably successful, and today nearly 65 per cent of household savings are being invested in financial assets as against only 46 per cent in 197980."
3578,1986-87,"The household sector accounts for over 80 per cent of our national savings, and the substantial increase in the holding of financial assets augurs well for the future development of our financial and capital markets."
3579,1986-87,There is considerable interest among small investors in investing in shares quoted in the Stock Exchanges with a view to getting the benefit of capital appreciation.
3580,1986-87,"Most, however, lack the necessary expertise and are also subject to exploitation by unscrupulous elements."
3581,1986-87,"In order to provide a channel for such investors, it is proposed to set up a new Mutual Fund in the public sector as a subsidiary of the Unit Trust of India."
3582,1986-87,"Investment in units of the proposed Mutual Fund would qualify for exemption of capital gains under Section 54E of the Income Tax Act, subject to certain conditions."
3583,1986-87,This will be in addition to the already existing facility of investment in the Units of the Unit Trust of India.
3584,1986-87,"An important innovation to tap people’s savings, particularly rural savings, for public sector projects was announced by me last year."
3585,1986-87,Public sector companies in Telecommunications and Power sectors have been permitted to raise funds from the public through a new series of bonds.
3586,1986-87,"These bonds provide an attractive rate of interest, and are quoted in the Stock Exchange."
3587,1986-87,"As a further innovation, in the next year, the Government will introduce another series of Public Sector Bonds with a tax free return."
3588,1986-87,"In addition, other benefits, such as Wealth Tax exemption will also be available."
3589,1986-87,I am sure that people will respond enthusiastically to this opportunity for contributing to the country’s development.
3590,1986-87,"At this point I would like to refer to a somewhat technical matter, which nevertheless has an important bearing on the impact of fiscal management on the rest of the economy."
3591,1986-87,This relates to the measurement of budgetary deficit.
3592,1986-87,"The Chakravarty Committee, which was set up by the Reserve Bank of India to review the working of the monetary system, has observed that the budgetary deficit, as conventionally defined in the Budget documents, does not accurately measure the monetary impact of the Government’s fiscal operations."
3593,1986-87,"The Committee has, therefore, recommended that the budgetary deficit should include changes in the entire RBI credit to the Government, including changes in RBI’s holding of long dated securities."
3594,1986-87,"The Government proposes to accept, in principle, this recommendation of the Committee."
3595,1986-87,The modalities for effecting the change in the definition of budgetary deficit will he worked out in consultation with the Reserve Bank.
3596,1986-87,"The Government also proposes to accept the Committee’s recommendation for setting overall monetary targets, which can be monitored, and which will help bring about better coordination between fiscal and monetary policies, and make their overall management more scientific."
3597,1986-87,There are certain technical difficulties in devising operational rules because of shortrun volatility of monetary variables.
3598,1986-87,An exercise to develop operationally meaningful targets will be undertaken by Government on an experimental basis in the next year.
3599,1986-87,I shall now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198586 and the Budget Estimates for 198687.
3600,1986-87,There were several important developments in regard to Budget Estimates for Revenue and Expenditure presented by me last year.
3601,1986-87,"As I mentioned a little while ago, tax revenues have exceeded Budget Estimates by a large margin."
3602,1986-87,"The Revised Estimates show an increase of Rs 2476 crores, which is 21 per cent higher than last years’ tax realisation, and 10 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates for 198586."
3603,1986-87,Direct Taxes will be 15 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates and Incometax Collections are expected to be as much as 36 per cent higher.
3604,1986-87,This order of increase in Direct Tax collections is unprecedented.
3605,1986-87,The Centre’s share of taxes will increase by 19 per cent over 198485 and that of States by 30 per cent.
3606,1986-87,Another heartening feature of fiscal developments is the sharp increase in Small Savings collections.
3607,1986-87,These will be 23 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates and 32 per cent more than the previous year.
3608,1986-87,"As regards other receipts, nontax revenue will be 2 per cent higher and capital receipts including market borrowings, external assistance and small savings will show an overall increase of 8 per cent."
3609,1986-87,"Taking advantage of buoyancy in tax revenues and satisfactory behaviour of other economic indicators, including the high level of food stocks, the Government decided to step up the Central Plan by Rs 1594 crores."
3610,1986-87,"The Revised Estimate for the Central Plan is Rs 20,094 crores as against Budget Estimates of Rs 18,500 crores."
3611,1986-87,"In the additional allocations, particular care has been taken to provide adequately for the infrastructure sectors like railways, steel and aluminium on the one hand and antipoverty programmes on the other."
3612,1986-87,Several States continued to face problems of resources in the first half of the current year.
3613,1986-87,A number of steps were taken to help them in overcoming these problems.
3614,1986-87,I shall refer to them a little later.
3615,1986-87,"Coming to nonPlan expenditure, additional provisions amounting to Rs 440 crores were made for interim relief, liberalised ad hoc bonus, pensionary benefits, and additional dearness allowance sanctioned to Government employees in the current year."
3616,1986-87,Defence expenditure is placed at Rs 7862 crores as against Budget Estimate of Rs 7686 crores.
3617,1986-87,"Interest payments are estimated at Rs 7400 crores, which is about 5 per cent higher than the Budged Estimate of Rs 7075 crores."
3618,1986-87,"There was, however, substantial increase during the year on account of food and fertiliser subsidies."
3619,1986-87,"The Revised Estimates for these subsidies are Rs 1650 crores and Rs 2050 crores, representing an increase of 50 per cent and 14 per cent respectively, over the Budget Estimates."
3620,1986-87,"Altogether, subsidies will be 24 per cent higher than the Budget Estimates."
3621,1986-87,"The Revised Estimates for total receipts are Rs 46,01 crores as against the Revised Estimates of expenditure of Rs 50,507 crores, leaving a deficit of Rs 4,490 crores."
3622,1986-87,The Budget deficit is thus expected to be higher than the Budget Estimates.
3623,1986-87,"However, despite this, the rate of growth of money supply in the economy has been lower than in the previous year."
3624,1986-87,The deficit has been absorbed by the economy without unduly aggravating the overall liquidity position.
3625,1986-87,"In framing next year’s Budget Estimates,"
3626,1986-87,"As the House is aware, the Seventh Plan envisages a total public sector outlay of Rs 1,80,000 crores of which Rs 95,534 crores has been earmarked for the Central Plan at 198485 prices."
3627,1986-87,"To finance this order of Central Plan, as pointed out in the document on Long Term Fiscal Policy, an outlay of about Rs 18,000 crores at 198485 prices was required for 198687."
3628,1986-87,"At present prices, this is roughly equivalent to Rs 20,000 crores."
3629,1986-87,"The annual Plan discussions conducted by the Planning Commission with the Ministries, however, revealed that a much higher order of Plan outlay is required for 198687, in order to maintain the momentum of investment in the core public sector, and accelerate the implementation of andpoverty programmes."
3630,1986-87,"It has, therefore, been decided to allocate Rs 22,300 crores for next year’s Plan."
3631,1986-87,"This constitutes a massive increase of Rs 3,800 crores or 20.5 per cent over the Budget Estimates for 198586."
3632,1986-87,"Although this is by no means sufficient to fulfil all our needs, I believe that 10 this order of increase will enable us to meet our urgent requirements."
3633,1986-87,"Taking the first two years together, we would have provided over 40 per cent of the Seventh Plan outlay in real terms at 198485 prices."
3634,1986-87,This is substantially better than in the first two years of the Sixth Plan.
3635,1986-87,"I am also happy to inform the House that the total Plan outlay of States, for 198687 has been fixed at Rs 15,880 crores, representing an increase of 21 per cent over the current year."
3636,1986-87,"For the Union Territories, the Plan outlay has been fixed at Rs 872 crores compared with current year’s level of Rs 640 crores."
3637,1986-87,It is also a matter of satisfaction to me that the Centre provided substantial additional resources to States in the current year which has strengthened the financial position of States.
3638,1986-87,"Compared with 198485, as I mentioned earlier, the States’ share of Central taxes has gone up by 30 per cent."
3639,1986-87,This reflects the sharp increase that has taken place in revenue collections as also the increase in the share of States as a result of the recommendations of the Finance Commission.
3640,1986-87,I am glad that Centre’s efforts to improve tax collections have also been of substantial benefit to States.
3641,1986-87,There has been a steep increase in other forms of transfer of resources as well.
3642,1986-87,The States’ share in small savings has registered an increase of 50 per cent and the Centre’s Plan assistance to States has increased by 38 per cent.

3646,1986-87,A problem that has bedevilled the fiscal picture for more than a decade has thus been solved.
3647,1986-87,I should make it clear that this problem will not be allowed to recur.

3777,1986-87,PART B In the last year’s
3778,1986-87,Budget I had announced the Government’s intention to formulate a Long Term Fiscal Policy coterminus with the Plan.
3779,1986-87,I am glad that the Government has been able to keep this commitment.
3780,1986-87,"The statement of the Government’s long term fiscal intentions has, I am aware, greatly reduced the speculation and drama 17 that has traditionally surrounded Budgets."
3781,1986-87,"I hope Hon’ble Members will agree that the loss in dramatic content has been more than compensated by the gain in imparting a stable framework, and much greater opportunity for open debate, in relation to Government’s fiscal policies."
3782,1986-87,A primary thrust of this Budget is to implement the various elements of the Long Term Fiscal Policy.
3783,1986-87,"In particular, I shall be proposing a major overhaul of our system of excise taxation, which will reduce the cascading effect of multipoint excise levies and help in reducing costs and prices to consumers."
3784,1986-87,"The Budget will strengthen the development of handlooms, improve the supply of cheaper cloth, and lower duties on drugs and medicines and certain other articles of interest to consumers."
3785,1986-87,"I also propose to liberalise the excise exemptions scheme for small scale industry, which will encourage growth of this sector and create more employment opportunities."
3786,1986-87,"In order to promote selfreliance and encourage domestic production, I propose to provide substantial help to domestic production of edible oils and to the indigenous capital goods industry."
3787,1986-87,"Naturally, I shall also be making certain proposals for raising revenue, the burden of which will fall on the affluent sections of society."
3788,1986-87,I would be brief in setting out my proposals for direct taxes as these have been discussed in the Long Term Fiscal Policy.
3789,1986-87,We are introducing legislation to give effect to the following proposals: 1 A Funding Scheme is being introduced which will replace the scheme for Investment Allowance.
3790,1986-87,Assessees will be allowed deduction to the extent of 20 per cent of the profsf these are deposited with the Industrial Development Bank of India or utilised for purchase of plant and machinery.
3791,1986-87,"Surcharge on companies which was largely being deposited with Industrial Development Bank of India, is being abolished from assessment year 1987 88, along with the introduction of the New Funding Scheme."
3792,1986-87,The benefit of both investment allowance and the funding scheme will not be available in the same assessment year.
3793,1986-87,"In the interest of revenue, I am postponing giving effect to this measure by one more year."
3794,1986-87,"In regard to Capital Gains taxation, the date of determining the cost of assets is being advanced from 1.1.64 to 1.4.74, and a uniform rate of deduction at the rate of 50 per cent is being prescribed for long term capital gains from buildings and lands and 60 per cent from other assets."
3795,1986-87,Bonds issued by Industrial Development Bank of India and Bonds issued 18 by other notified public sector agencies are also being added to the list of investments qualifying for exemptions from Capital gains.
3796,1986-87,"The limit for initial deduction is being increased from Rs 5,000/ to Rs 10,000/. The present period of one year for purchase of a residential house in a case where the capital gains arise on sale of an old house is being increased to 2 years."
3797,1986-87,"As promised in the Long Term Fiscal Policy Statement, I propose to introduce a system of allowing depreciation in respect of blocks of assets instead of the present system of depreciation on individual assets."
3798,1986-87,"Simultaneously, I propose to rationalise the rate structure by reducing the number of rates as also by providing for depreciation at higher rates so as to ensure that more than 80 per cent of the cost of the plant and machinery is written off in a period of 4 years or less."
3799,1986-87,This will render replacement easier and help modernisation.
3800,1986-87,"Apart from those items which are eligible for 100 per cent depreciation in the initial year itself, there are at present different rates for plant and machinery."
3801,1986-87,I propose to have only two rates of depreciation at 33 1/3 per cent and 50 per cent.
3802,1986-87,"Plant and machinery used as antipollution devices and those using indigenous knowhow, are proposed to be placed in a block carrying the higher rate of depreciation of 50 per cent."
3803,1986-87,Buildings meant for lowpaid employees of industrial undertakings will be entitled to depreciation at 20 per cent as against the general rate of 5 per cent for residential buildings and 10 per cent for nonresidential buildings.
3804,1986-87,It has been brought home to me that of late I am not very popular with housewives.
3805,1986-87,"Their support and sympathy, I cannot afford to lose."
3806,1986-87,"Therefore, I propose to raise the standard deduction from 25 per cent to 30 per cent of salary income."
3807,1986-87,"The ceiling will be increased from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000."
3808,1986-87,The measure will benefit 3.5 lakh tax payers in the fixed income group.
3809,1986-87,I am giving this benefit on the condition that it will be duly passed on to the housewives.
3810,1986-87,"While the medical needs of some groups of salary earners are taken care of by the employers, there is no such provision in the case of other salary earners and of selfemployed persons."
3811,1986-87,"In order to provide some relief in respect of medical expenses by such persons, I propose to allow a deduction out of the total income of such persons, subject to limits, of the amount spent by them on medical treatment or paid as premium on medical insurance policies taken by them with the General Insurance Corporation of India."
3812,1986-87,In line with the Long Term Fiscal Policy another major step being taken is to empower the Government with a preemptive right to purchase properties which are offered for sale in the market at the price agreed to by the transferer.
3813,1986-87,"To begin with, this provision will apply to properties valued at over Rs 10 lakhs located in metropolitan cities."
3814,1986-87,"An honest seller, wherever he may be, will not be hurt by this measure."
3815,1986-87,"For the rest, it is between them and the IncomeTax Department  and God!"
3816,1986-87,One of the vexatious problems in Wealth Tax has been the determination of the market value of assets.
3817,1986-87,"In order to eliminate the endless controversy and litigation arising out of this, we have decided to frame simpler rules for the valuation of assets such as shares, residential properties, commercial properties, jewellery, etc. and these will be notified by the end of March, 1986."
3818,1986-87,"In the Long Term Fiscal Policy I had announced the intention of the Government to retain Gift Tax, and review its provisions with a view to rationalising them."
3819,1986-87,"The following amendments are being made in the Gift Tax Act: a The basic exemption limit will be raised from Rs 5,000/ to Rs 20,000/. b Gift tax will be levied at a flat rate of 30 per cent of the value of the taxable gifts."
3820,1986-87,The provision relating to aggregation of gifts.
3821,1986-87,There is at present tax deduction at source from out of winnings derived from races and lotteries.
3822,1986-87,I propose to tax these windfall profits at a flat rate of 40 per cent of the gross receipts.
3823,1986-87,"The exemption from income of a casual and nonrecurring nature will simultaneously be raised from Rs 1,000 to Rs 5,000."
3824,1986-87,"Income from any winnings from crossword puzzles, card games, other games of any sort or from gambling or betting of any form or nature whatsoever, races including horse races other than income earned by owners of race horses by way of stake money and winnings from lotteries will not be aggregated with other incomes."
3825,1986-87,"That is to say, losses, if any, from other business will not be allowed to be set off against winnings from races or lotteries."
3826,1986-87,It has been said that “whoever plays deep must necessarily lose his money or his character”.
3827,1986-87,"In depriving the lucky winner of his money, I hope I would have contributed to the building of his character."
3828,1986-87,"The above measure along with the withdrawal of certain other tax concessions in respect of intercorporate dividends, will net additional revenue of Rs 54 crores."
3829,1986-87,It is proposed that part of the benefit of tax deduction on export profits should be allowed to be transferred to the supporting manufacturers.
3830,1986-87,This will help increase our exports.
3831,1986-87,"The Long Term Fiscal Policy recognises the need to widen the tax base and to bring all persons who have income above taxable limit, into the tax net."
3832,1986-87,"For this purpose, it is necessary to carry out surveys."
3833,1986-87,An amendment is being made to authorise the Incometax authorities to collect certain information.
3834,1986-87,"We are also taking separate 20 steps to strengthen survey, investigation and prosecution machinery of the Incometax Department 106."
3835,1986-87,"In the Long Term Fiscal Policy, I had indicated the outline of a National Deposit Scheme New Series for public discussion."
3836,1986-87,"I am grateful for the comments and suggestions received from the general public, experts and also many Hon’ble Members of Parliament."
3837,1986-87,Suggestions have been received for liberalising its provisions as well as for making these more restrictive.
3838,1986-87,In view of the importance of this measure.
3839,1986-87,I have decided to refer this proposal to the Committee on Expenditure Tax for more intensive examination.
3840,1986-87,"I am asking them to submit their report on this aspect by May, 1986."
3841,1986-87,"The Long Term Fiscal Policy has also proposed the creation of a Venture Fund to promote indigenous technology, to be administered by the Industrial Development Bank of India."
3842,1986-87,"It was proposed that as a source of funding this scheme, a small 5 per cent Research and Development levy will be imposed on all payments made for purchase of technology from abroad, including royalty payments, lump sum payments and payments for designs and drawings."
3843,1986-87,A separate Bill to give effect to this levy will be introduced in Parliament.
3844,1986-87,We also propose to carry out the following amendments: a Investment allowance and depreciation is claimed on the basis of actual cost.
3845,1986-87,In the past few years a number of companies have been using an accounting practice of capitalising the entire amount of interest on the monies borrowed for acquiring of plant and machinery.
3846,1986-87,This artificially inflates the cost of the assets and the net worth of the company.
3847,1986-87,We are clarifying that the capitalisation of interest paid or payable will not be allowed after the asset is first put to use.
3848,1986-87,"The ceiling of investment in plant and machinery for the small scale sector is being raised from Rs 20 lakhs to Rs 35 lakhs, as mentioned last year and would be applicable to all cases where the previous year ends after 17th March, 1985."
3849,1986-87,This enhancement will be relevant also for the grant of investment allowance and for reduction in respect of profits and gains from newly established small scale industrial undertakings in rural areas.
3850,1986-87,"There is, at present, a great disparity between persons in receipt of house rent allowance and those provided with rent free accommodation, the former being worse off in the matter of payment of taxes."
3851,1986-87,Amendments are being introduced to do away with this discrimination.
3852,1986-87,At present notional income from selfoccupied house is being taken into account for taxes.
3853,1986-87,It is proposed to exempt such notional income.
3854,1986-87,We had initiated a simplification exercise in the last Budget which has been continued this year.
3855,1986-87,"It is proposed to bring out a comprehensive new Direct Taxes Code by June, 1986."
3856,1986-87,The total effect of these proposals will be a revenue loss of Rs 33 crores and a revenue gain of Rs 54 crores.
3857,1986-87,"The net increase in revenue will, therefore, be Rs 21 crores."
3858,1986-87,I now come to my proposals relating to Indirect Taxes.
3859,1986-87,An important item in our agenda for 198687 is to initiate reform in the system of indirect taxes.
3860,1986-87,The first step was taken in the Winter Session of the Parliament when new Tariff Bills for Customs and Excise were introduced based on the harmonized system of classification.
3861,1986-87,The new structure is scientific and international.
3862,1986-87,"In the second stage, the tariff structure with such amendments of duties, as will be carried out in this Budget, will replace the old ad hoc structure."
3863,1986-87,In excise taxation a vexatious question which has been often encountered is the taxation of inputs and the cascading effect of this on the value of the final product.
3864,1986-87,"The Long Term Fiscal Policy had stated that the best solution would be to extend the present system of proforma credit to all exciseable commodities with the exception of a few sectors with special problems like petroleum, tobacco and textiles."
3865,1986-87,"This scheme, which has been referred as Modified Value Added Tax MODVAT scheme  I shall stress MODVAT, not MADVAT  allows the manufacturer to obtain instant and complete reimbursement of the excise duty paid on the components and raw materials."
3866,1986-87,Amount of excise duty payable depends upon the value of the final product and the rate of duty.
3867,1986-87,Introduction of MODVAT will decrease the cost of the final product considerably through the availability of instant credit of the duties paid on the inputs and consequential reduction of interest costs.
3868,1986-87,It would be noticed that the MODVAT scheme avoids the payment of duties on earlier duties paid.
3869,1986-87,"The payment of duty drawback will be swifter as the element of excise duty will be transparent It will, therefore, benefit both the consumers and exporters."
3870,1986-87,"However, in view of the novelty of the scheme, we have to hasten slowly and implement the MODVAT scheme in stages."
3871,1986-87,"As a first measure, I propose to introduce MODVAT scheme for all goods covered by 37 specified chapters of the 22 Central Excise Tariff Act, 1985."
3872,1986-87,"The Scheme as a result would cover products of chemical and allied industries, paints and packaging materials, plastics, glass and glassware, rubber products, base metals and articles of base metals, machinery and mechanical appliances including electrical equipments, motor vehicles and certain miscellaneous manufactured products."
3873,1986-87,"This would imply that as long as the input and the final product are covered by the specified 37 chapters and the final product bears some duty of excise, credit of duty on the inputs covered by these chapters will be available."
3874,1986-87,The proforma credit given will cover both excise duty and additional duty of customs also known as countervailing duty.
3875,1986-87,"Set off will also be available for packaging materials, consumables, paints though these are not strictly raw materials."
3876,1986-87,Items outside these chapters availing proforma credit and benefits of set off under any erstwhile schemes would be allowed to continue to get the relief to the extent the revised tariff headings permit.
3877,1986-87,"However, the MODVAT scheme and the erstwhile schemes to the extent they are continued, will be mutually exclusive."
3878,1986-87,"The MODVAT scheme will be in force from 1st March, 1986."
3879,1986-87,"Manufacturers who fulfil the requirement will be able to avail of proforma credit in respect of the permissible goods which have suffered duty of excise from 1st February, 1986 and are either in the stocks or are received by the manufacturer on or after 1st March, 1986."
3880,1986-87,"As stated earlier, the introduction of MODVAT scheme will result in considerable reduction in the cost of final product and, therefore, to retain the collection of excise duties at the earlier level, the rates of duties on the final product have been suitably adjusted."
3881,1986-87,"After accounting for the set off, the duty rates have been rounded to the nearest step in the new duty structure."
3882,1986-87,"While all care has been taken to work out the incidence of set off benefits, the scheme being a new one, Central Board of Excise and Customs would take corrective steps wherever anomalies are noted."
3883,1986-87,"In respect of Small Scale Industry, the objective of reform is to ensure that the scheme of concessions is a ladder and not a lid."
3884,1986-87,"That is to say, such concessions should facilitate and encourage healthy growth of the small scale units and prevent unnecessary fragmentation and bifurcation of units."
3885,1986-87,"With this end in view, I propose to introduce a New Scheme of Excise Concessions for small scale units."
3886,1986-87,The proposed scheme will considerably enhance the scope of concessions available to the small scale sector.
3887,1986-87,"Under the New Scheme, the full exemption will continue to be available upto clearances of Rs 7.5 lakhs in a year which account for nearly 85 per cent of the small scale units in the country."
3888,1986-87,"Under the chief existing scheme, excise duty is chargeable in slabs of 25 per cent, 50 per cent or 75 per cent of the duty rate upto a turnover limit of Rs 40 lakhs."
3889,1986-87,"After that, full duty is chargeable until turnover reaches Rs 75 lakhs."
3890,1986-87,If a unit crosses this level it loses the entire exemption.
3891,1986-87,"It has been noticed that the present slab 23 rate system has provided strong temptation for small scale units to stay below a particular limit or to understate their, actual production."
3892,1986-87,"Under the New Scheme, in respect of clearances in excess of Rs 7.5 lakhs, the excise concession will be available at a flat rate of 10 percentage points below normal duty, subject to a minimum excise duty of 5 per cent."
3893,1986-87,This concession will apply upto a turnover limit of Rs 75 lakhs.
3894,1986-87,Thereafter the unit will pay normal duty but continue to enjoy the concessional rate on the first 75 lakhs of turnover.
3895,1986-87,"However, this concession will be lost when the Unit has crossed a turnover of Rs 1.5 crores."
3896,1986-87,"As a transitional measure and to overcome possible handicap in certain marginal cases, I am proposing that units in the turnover range of Rs 7.5 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs may be allowed to pay concessional excise duty either at a rate of 10 percentage points below the excise duty rate or 25 per cent of the excise duty but not less than 2.5 per cent."
3897,1986-87,The relief corresponding to this turnover range will also continue to be available to units with higher turnover for the prescribed period of one year.
3898,1986-87,"An important feature of the new scheme is its universal applicability to all types of exciseable goods with a few exceptions like cosmetics, TV sets, refrigerating and airconditioning appliances, etc. 124."
3899,1986-87,A new and major concession which is being allowed to the small scale sector relates to grant of proforma credit under the MODVAT scheme.
3900,1986-87,We are providing that proforma credit would be equal to the notional normal duty even when the small scale unit would have paid only concessional duty.
3901,1986-87,"The introduction of this new SSI scheme from 1st March, 1986 will mean a revenue loss of Rs 75 crores."
3902,1986-87,In the last year’s Budget Special Excise Duty had been removed from as many as 100 items from the Excise Tariff.
3903,1986-87,I now propose to remove the Special Excise Duty on the remaining 32 items of the old Tariff.
3904,1986-87,My next set of proposals relate to incentives for greater production of edible oils.
3905,1986-87,"It is well known that the potential of production of oils from rice bran, oil cakes, cotton seeds, tree oil seeds is not fully exploited."
3906,1986-87,"A big thrust to maximise extraction of such oils, especially edible oils from these sources is proposed to be accomplished by the following measures: 1"
3907,1986-87,"If minor oils like rice bran oil, mahuwa oil, water melon seed oil, sal seed oil and mango kernel oil are used by the Vanaspati units in excess of 3 per cent in the total oil mix, an excise duty relief of Rs 100 per metric tonne on Vanaspati will be given for each additional percentage point of use of such minor oils."
3908,1986-87,"In case cotton seed oil is used in excess of 15 per cent in the total oil mix for Vanaspati production, a relief of excise duty to the extent of Rs 30/ 24 per metric tonne of Vanaspati for each additional percentage point of use will be given."
3909,1986-87,The maximum relief for the use of minor oils and cotton seed oil together will not exceed Rs 1000 per metric tonne.
3910,1986-87,The extent of relief in case of use in soap is being increased to Rs 25/ per metric tonne for each additional percentage point of minor oils in excess of 3 per cent of such oils in the total oil mix.
3911,1986-87,The relief now will be available for 10 additional minor oils apart from the 4 minor oils which enjoy the concession today at a lower rate.
3912,1986-87,The excise duty on solvents is being brought to Nil from the existing Rs 1050/ per kilo litre.
3913,1986-87,This measure is expected to reduce imports and encourage the greater use of minor technical oils.
3914,1986-87,It is proposed to provide a cash compensatory support of 10 per cent of the f.o.b. value of oil meal exports.
3915,1986-87,The poorer sections of our society consume unrefined vegetable oils made from crushing of domestic oilseeds and it is proper that such oils continue excise duty free.
3916,1986-87,We do not allow the use of crushed groundnut oil or mustard oil in vanaspati so that it remains available for direct consumption by the weaker consumers.
3917,1986-87,"There is, however, a production of less than 5 lakh tonnes of refined edible oils which is consumed by the affluent classes."
3918,1986-87,"In general, the prices of these refined oils are even higher than those of vanaspati and the commercial margins are high."
3919,1986-87,I propose to levy an excise duty of Rs 1500 per tonne on costly refined edible oils in line with the excise duty on vanaspati.
3920,1986-87,"However, to encourage the production of new refined minor oils, we propose to exempt from this levy refined oils from soyabean, rice bran, cotton seed and sunflower."
3921,1986-87,The total revenue gain on account of the excise duty on a few refined vegetable oils will be Rs 80 crores in a year; while the total revenue loss as a result of the above described measures would be Rs 82.20 crores.
3922,1986-87,"These proposals would, therefore, be revenue negative to the extent of Rs 2.20 crores."
3923,1986-87,I have to announce the following measures which will help exports and export production: 1 Export duty on unmanufactured tobacco has lost its rationale.
3924,1986-87,"In order to provide a competitive edge to the unmanufactured tobacco in the 25 international market and to ensure that the tobacco farmers are able to get a fair price, I propose to provide total exemption from export duty on this item."
3925,1986-87,"In view of the potential of this industry for exports and employment, it I proposed to further improve the general drawback rate to 10 per cent."
3926,1986-87,It has been a long standing demand of the footwear industry that the scheme of excise concession to small scale units of footwear production presently granted to units with 2 HP and 49 workers should be reviewed.’
3927,1986-87,It is now proposed to extend the scheme of exemption to small scale industries to the footwear sector also.
3928,1986-87,"In view of the shortage in the availability of wattle bark to our industry, the import duty has been reduced from 70 per cent to 40 per valorem."
3929,1986-87,"The import duty on leathershaving blades is being reduced from an average rate of 72.5 per, 40 per cent."
3930,1986-87,"It is, therefore, proposed to reduce duty on specified machines used in processing and packaging of marine products from existing rate of cent to 40 per cent Basic and Auxiliary."
3931,1986-87,"This would require development of production of branded products which will sell both in the domestic and in the export n is proposed to do away with the excise duty presently levied on branded cigars, cheroots and cigarillos."
3932,1986-87,Excise duty on branded Hukka tobacco is also being abolished.
3933,1986-87,I may confess that total excise collections on these items were insignificant.
3934,1986-87,Those who cannot afford to smoke cigarettes can now turn to cigars and cheroots.
3935,1986-87,Arrangements are also being made to allow export of gem and jewellery through air mail and parcel post from Bombay and Jaipur.
3936,1986-87,The concessions given in the interest of exports will cost the exchequer Rs 12.94 crores on the custom and Rs 9 lakhs on the excise side.
3937,1986-87,"In the textile sector, considerable relief has already been provided in August, 1985 as part of the implementation of the first stage of Textile Policy."
3938,1986-87,"From a review made by the Department of Textiles, it is observed that the market prices of fibre, 26 blended yarn and fabrics showed a declining trend upto November, 1985, though increase was noticed in December, 1985 and January, 1986."
3939,1986-87,"On the production side, there has been an increase: production of blended yarn from 129.72 million kilogrammes during JulyDecember, 1994 to 146.72 million kilogrammes during JulyDecember, 1985."
3940,1986-87,"It may, however, take some time to realise the full benefits of the duty reliefs."
3941,1986-87,"Under the ‘Sulabh’ cloth scheme, National Textiles Corporation has been provided with duty free polyester and production of such cheap blended fabrics would go up to 50 million metres in 198687."
3942,1986-87,The Textile Policy also aims at encouraging production of blended fabrics on handlooms.
3943,1986-87,Government considering a scheme whereby specified handloom organisations can be provided blended yarn made from duty polyester fibre.
3944,1986-87,"For the present, I propose to fully exempt blended polyester cotton and polyester viscose yarn w certain polyester content supplied to specified handloom organisations."
3945,1986-87,Duty is also being fully waived on processing of specified blended fabrics by specified handloom development organisations.
3946,1986-87,"Handloom cess, which is now being collected at the rate of 1.9 paise per square metre is utilised for development of handlooms."
3947,1986-87,I propose to raise the cess to 2.5 paise per square metre.
3948,1986-87,"The revenue gain of Rs 3., from this measure will be utilised for setting up an Enforcement Machinery to ensure that the items reserved for handloom sector are not encroached upon by other sectors of the textile industry."
3949,1986-87,I propose to extend exemption from excise duty to cover all shoddy woollen products.
3950,1986-87,"These will include blankets, melton cloth, shoddy shawls and other fabrics."
3951,1986-87,"As a measure of relief to the woollen industry, I propose to reduce the import duty on raw wool from 4C cent to 20 per cent ad valorem."
3952,1986-87,"To make up this loss and also to avoid assessment disputes, I propose to increase import duty on wool waste and woollen rags from 10 per cent to 20 per cent."
3953,1986-87,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, a reduced rate of customs duty of 25 per cent ad valorem was provided respect of a few sophisticated textile machines in the year 1983."
3954,1986-87,"I propose to continue those reliefs for one more Moreover, in order to encourage domestic production of certain sophisticated textile machines, I propose to provide reduced rate of customs duty of 25 per cent ad valorem in respect of components of such machines."
3955,1986-87,This will involve a loss of Rs 2.74 crores in a year.
3956,1986-87,"To protect jute bag industry, I propose to levy duty on synthetic tapes at the rate of Rs 10 per kilogramme where input duty relief will be available; on other tapes the duty will be Rs 4 per kilogramme."
3957,1986-87,This will also result revenue gain of Rs 15 crores in a full year.
3958,1986-87,"Our review of the earlier reliefs given during 1985 have shown that while reliefs were passed on by the fibre manufacturers, the blended yarn producers did not 27 do so after an initial period of decline in prices."
3959,1986-87,The prices of blended yarn produced by many of the important companies has gone up to or near the level prior to the grant of excise relief.
3960,1986-87,"I think it is necessary to establish the principle that if the spirit of reliefs given in the interest of consumers is not respected, the Government will withdraw the reliefs."
3961,1986-87,I am reducing the reliefs given to the yarn producers roughly by about 50 per cent.
3962,1986-87,On their future conduct will depend our further response.
3963,1986-87,The Government is also committed to increasing the share of additional duty in lieu of sales tax.
3964,1986-87,"I propose to raise the additional duty of excise on cotton and manmade fabrics of value, exceeding Rs 50 per square metre by Rs 2.50 per square metre."
3965,1986-87,This will yield a revenue of Rs 18 crores for the States.
3966,1986-87,The above proposals will lead to a gain of Rs 55.83 crores in excise duty and a loss of Rs 2.74 crores in the customs duties.
3967,1986-87,We have received a number of representations from associations of industries and from the concerned Ministries pointing out the need of certain rationalisation which are unimportant from the revenue angle but would remove difficulties for the industry or will bring down the leakage of revenue.
3968,1986-87,Paper industry has been representing that the scheme of relief to the paper units using at least 50 per cent unconventional raw materials does not encourage the mills to increase production.
3969,1986-87,"In the new scheme which I am proposing all paper mills whose clearances did not exceed 24,000 tonnes in the previous financial year and which do not have a bamboo or wood pulp plant will pay duty at the rate of Rs 300, Rs 650, Rs 1200 and Rs 1500 per metric tonne for the successive slabs respectively."
3970,1986-87,"For paper mills with clearances exceeding 24,000 metric tonnes or larger paper mills having bamboo or wood pulp plant, the rate of duty will be 10 per cent ad valorem, plus Rs 850/ per metric tonne."
3971,1986-87,Finer varieties of paper are being excluded from these reduced rates.
3972,1986-87,"These schemes will be in force from Ist April, 1986 and will cost the exchequer Rs 6 crores in a year."
3973,1986-87,"It is proposed to have a single uniform rate of excise duty of 30 per cent ad valorem in respect of 3 major thermo plastics, namely, Low Density Polyethylene, High Density Polyethylene and Polypropylene."
3974,1986-87,The loss in excise duty would be Rs 7.24 crores.
3975,1986-87,"We are, however, revising the customs duty suitably to make the step revenue neutral."
3976,1986-87,There will be a revenue gain of Rs 7.52 crores in customs duties.
3977,1986-87,Engineering plastics are raw materials which will have an increasing use in India.
3978,1986-87,It is proposed to have a concessional rate of 60 per cent ad valorem of customs duty Basic plus Auxiliary in respect of 4 such specified engineering plastics.
3979,1986-87,"The additional duty of customs as appropriate will, however, continue to be levied."
3980,1986-87,"It is also proposed to provide for uniform rate of excise duty of 35 per cent ad valorem in respect of plates, sheets, films and foils of plastic materials and these items are being brought under the general scheme of small scale exemptions."
3981,1986-87,"In consonance with the Drug Policy, I propose to exempt 23 specified Drug intermediates from the levy of additional duty of customs, thereby reducing the total customs duty on these to 110 per cent ad valorem."
3982,1986-87,Revenue sacrifice will be Rs 1 crore.
3983,1986-87,I also propose to exempt additional 41 life saving formulations from excise duty.
3984,1986-87,This will cost the exchequer Rs 15 crores.
3985,1986-87,The total customs duty on additional five medical equipments of consumable nature is being abolished.
3986,1986-87,In the last Budget exemptions from customs duty in excess of 45 per cent was provided in respect of 10 specified items of sophisticated medical equipments.
3987,1986-87,I propose to enlarge this list substantially by adding 101 items of medical equipments and exempt them from duty in excess of 40 per cent ad valorem.
3988,1986-87,"In order to encourage domestic production of medical equipments, I also propose to allow a concessional rate of customs duty of 40 per cent ad valorem in respect of components for manufacture of 15 identified medical equipments."
3989,1986-87,"In the 1985 Budget, we had given a total exemption from customs duty in respect of consumable goods imported for scientific research by public funded research institutions upto the value of Rs 50,000/. As a measure to encourage indigenous research and development effort, I propose to remove the ceiling."
3990,1986-87,The revenue sacrifice would be Rs 5 crores.
3991,1986-87,These measures will involve a loss of Rs 28.24 crores in excise duties and Rs 0.48 crore in customs duties.
3992,1986-87,Some of the Other Rationalisations proposed are the following: a I wish to give relief to some items of daily use of the common man.
3993,1986-87,We are abolishing excise duty on stoves using kerosene and wood.
3994,1986-87,The value limit of complete excise exemption in case of footwear is being raised from Rs 30 per pair to Rs 45 per pair.
3995,1986-87,"Excise duty is also being abolished on brushes, combs, umbrellas, chalks and similar other materials."
3996,1986-87,The Long Term Fiscal Policy recognises that cesses levied as excise duties contribute to the multiplicity of taxes.
3997,1986-87,"As an endeavour to reduce the number of these cesses, it has been decided to dispense with the cess on cotton, copra and vegetable oils."
3998,1986-87,The Ministry of Agriculture will take appropriate action in the matter.
3999,1986-87,The loss to the exchequer on this account will be Rs 5.90 crores.
4000,1986-87,"It is proposed to fix an effective rate of customs duty on ships imported for breaking up at Rs 1,400/ per LDT and to exempt them from the auxiliary 29 and additional duties of customs."
4001,1986-87,"In recognition of the vital role of newspapers, I am reducing import duty on 4 items of printing equipment."
4002,1986-87,It is my hope that they will not accuse me of influencing the Press.
4003,1986-87,"Some of the other amendments which are being made are the following: i The effective rate of basic customs duty on caustic soda is being fixed at Rs 3,500/ per metric tonne, and we are exempting it from auxiliary and additional duties of customs."
4004,1986-87,"The effective rate of basic customs duty on PVC resin in being fixed at Rs 10,500/ per metric tonne."
4005,1986-87,The excise duty on marine plywood and aircraft plywood as an anti avoidance measure is being increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent ad valorem.
4006,1986-87,Effective rates of excise duty for match boxes containing 300 sticks per box are being provided.
4007,1986-87,These measures will involve a revenue gain of Rs 26.97 crores on the customs side and a loss of Rs 3.44 crores on the excise side.
4008,1986-87,I will now come to important measures of resource mobilisation.
4009,1986-87,My first proposal is to rationalise the structure of auxiliary duties of customs.
4010,1986-87,"At present, there are 11 slabs of auxiliary customs duties."
4011,1986-87,"While the specific duty on crude petroleum will remain as at present, it is proposed to reduce the existing 11 slabs into three slabs, namely, Nil, 25 per cent and 40 per cent."
4012,1986-87,This will give us a revenue gain of Rs 190 crores.
4013,1986-87,"However, removal of auxiliary duty from certain GATT bound items would mean a loss of Rs 9 crores."
4014,1986-87,"Earlier in my speech, I had referred to the importance of providing adequate support to our capital goods industry which is pivotal for self reliance."
4015,1986-87,"With this end in view, it is proposed to increase the general machinery rate of basic customs duty by 10 per cent."
4016,1986-87,A similar increase is also being made in the general project rate from 45 per cent to 55 per dent ad valorem.
4017,1986-87,"As a complement to this, it is proposed to reduce the import duty on components of capital goods by 5 per cent."
4018,1986-87,This will ensure that the import duty on components will now stand at 15 per cent below the import duty on the complete machines.
4019,1986-87,"This differential, as recommended in the Long Term Fiscal Policy, would go towards greater production of capital machines including computerised numerically controlled machine tools in India instead of their total imports."
4020,1986-87,"While the reduction in rate on components will lead to a revenue loss of Rs 50 crores, the increase in machinery rate will give Rs 124 crores and the revision of general project rate Rs 120 crores."
4021,1986-87,"In respect of 32 machine tools where domestic production has been established, the customs duty is being raised to 110 per cent."
4022,1986-87,"Again, 91 machine tools and instruments have been identified where there is negligible domestic production and it is proposed to reduce import duty on these machines to 35 per cent ad valorern basic plus auxiliary."
4023,1986-87,There will be a revenue sacrifice of Rs 9 crores in customs duties.
4024,1986-87,At present there is a concessional rate of duty on the fuel efficient cars which comes to about 15 per cent ad valorem or less.
4025,1986-87,"As I have mentioned earlier, full MODYAT will be extended to the automobile industry and the new MODVAT rates for fuel efficient cars would be 20 per cent ad valorem."
4026,1986-87,I feel that such cars and their purchasers can bear an increase in the rate of duty by 5 per cent.
4027,1986-87,The current rate of duty for nonfuel efficient cars is around 25 per cent.
4028,1986-87,The MODVAT rate of such cars would be 30 per cent.
4029,1986-87,It is proposed to increase the excise duty on nonfuel efficient cars also by 5 per cent so that the final duty would be 35 per cent.
4030,1986-87,A concession of excise duty was given for nonfuel efficient cars used as taxis.
4031,1986-87,It is proposed to fix this rate at 30 per cent.
4032,1986-87,"Under the new Excise Tariff, both the chassis of the vehicles and the body building of the motor vehicles are chargeable to excise duty."
4033,1986-87,Fun MODVAT is available for the chassis to the body builders in the final vehicle.
4034,1986-87,Body building imparts an added value to the chassis and it is proposed to levy excise duty of 20 per cent on the final vehicle also.
4035,1986-87,The net gain of the revenue of the above proposals would be Rs 40 crores.
4036,1986-87,The duty incidence on T.V. set has been rather low.
4037,1986-87,Substantial concessions in customs and excise duties have been given in the past in respect of raw materials and components for the electronics industry in general.
4038,1986-87,"Duty is proposed to be enhanced 31 from Rs 900 to Rs 1,500 per set in respect of colour TV sets of screen size exceeding 36 cms."
4039,1986-87,Ibis proposal will lead to a revenue gain of Rs 48 crores in a year.
4040,1986-87,I also propose to provide for levy of additional duty of customs on TV sets imported as baggage.
4041,1986-87,This increase would restrict the import of TV sets in baggage to some extent.
4042,1986-87,The gain in revenue in the customs dudes will be Rs 30 crores in a year.
4043,1986-87,I propose to increase the duty on airconditioners and replace the existing duty by a specific duty to stop evasion.
4044,1986-87,It is proposed to levy a specific rate of duty of Rs 8000 per airconditioner upto 1.5 tonne capacity.
4045,1986-87,A uniform duty of 60% ad valorern will now be levied on all parts and accessories of refrigerating and airconditioning machinery.
4046,1986-87,The duty on compressors for airconditioners would be specific at Rs 4000 per compressor.
4047,1986-87,"As we are extending full MODVAT relief to the industry, I propose to dispense with all enduse exemptions except for Government hospitals."
4048,1986-87,The special scheme of relief to small scale units in this sector will continue.
4049,1986-87,This measure will yield revenue of Rs 25 crores.
4050,1986-87,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from the Ist March, 1986, will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
4051,1986-87,"Apart from the above proposals, I have proposed some amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect some changes in the new Customs and Excise Tariffs."
4052,1986-87,These changes are based on the feedback we have had from the trade and industry as well as the field formations since the enactment of these two tariffs and generally seek to preserve the position that existed under the old tariffs.
4053,1986-87,My proposals in respect of Customs and Excise duties outlined above are likely to yield additional revenue of Rs 499.92 crores from customs duties and Rs 253.78 crores from excise duties.
4054,1986-87,The concessions and reliefs aggregate Rs 93.11 crores on the customs side and Rs 193.37 crores on the excise duty.
4055,1986-87,The net additional revenue from customs duties thus would be Rs 406.81 crores and that from excise duties Rs 60.41 crores.
4056,1986-87,"In the excise dudes, the Centre’s share would be Rs 24.19 crores and that of States Rs 36.22 crores."
4057,1986-87,In the total net additional yield of Rs 467.22 crores Centre’s share would be Rs 431.00 crores and that of the States Rs 36.22 crores.
4058,1986-87,I had earlier mentioned that the Budget deficit at the existing rates of taxes would be Rs 4095 crores.
4059,1986-87,"The proposed tax measures, taken together with reliefs, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 445 crores to the Centre."
4060,1986-87,This will leave an uncovered deficit of Rs 3650 crores.
4061,1986-87,"In relation to the size of our economy and the stock of money, the deficit is reasonable and noninflationary."
4062,1986-87,It is also significantly lower than last year.
4063,1986-87,"With this, Mr. Speaker I have come to the end of my task."
4064,1986-87,"My principal priorities in this Budget were to strengthen the public sector, to provide a further thrust to the antipoverty programmes, to promote selfreliance, and to provide relief to the common man."
4065,1986-87,I have provided an increase in the Plan by 20.5 per cent despite resource constraints.
4066,1986-87,"We will be financing over 40 per cent of the Seventh Plan in the first two years in real terms, which is an achievement in itself."
4067,1986-87,I have increased outlays for major antipoverty programmes by nearly 65 per cent in keeping with our socialist goals.
4068,1986-87,"New schemes are being introduced for the benefit of rickshaw pullers, cobblers, sweepers, porters and others among the urban disadvantaged groups."
4069,1986-87,Interest rates on Provident Fund contributions is being increased for the benefit of workers and the selfemployed.
4070,1986-87,I have provided tax relief to the fixed income groups.
4071,1986-87,"And I have given incentives for import substitution and export promotion, besides introducing several measures for rationalisation."
4072,1986-87,This Budget is just one step forward.
4073,1986-87,"Finally, in the immortal words of Mahatma Gandhi: “In times to come the people will not judge us by the creed we profess, or the label we wear, or the slogans we shout but by our work, industry, sacrifice ........”"
4074,1986-87,I commend this Budget to the House.
4075,1987-88,"We have to strive with all our strength for our planned development by conserving all our resources, increasing production and trying to ensure progressively a more equitable distribution, and thus to raise the standards of the great mass of our people.”"
4076,1987-88,These are our objectives today.
4077,1987-88,"When we came into office, we were fortunate in inheriting from Indiraji an economy that was sound."
4078,1987-88,"After the devastation of 197980, the inflation rate was brought down sharply."
4079,1987-88,"The growth rate was stepped up, and the infrastructure restored to health."
4080,1987-88,We have built on these successes and initiated a process of reform in areas requiring urgent attention.
4081,1987-88,"This, I believe, we have been able to accomplish in large measure."
4082,1987-88,"Our principal objectives are the elimination of poverty and the building of a strong, modern, selfreliant, independent economy."
4083,1987-88,In these two years we have sharpened the focus on poverty alleviation.
4084,1987-88,Direct outlays on antipoverty programmes were substantially increased in the last Budget.
4085,1987-88,The 20Point Programme 1986 was announced in August.
4086,1987-88,"Taking advantage of high stocks of food, rural employment programmes were expanded."
4087,1987-88,Two million tonnes of cereals were made available in tribal areas at highly subsidised rates.
4088,1987-88,We launched an important scheme to enlarge employment opportunities for the urban poor.
4089,1987-88,I have extensively toured and seen the work being done in the most backward and remote villages of our country.
4090,1987-88,"Talking to the people face to face, I know how much more needs to be done."
4091,1987-88,I am also convinced that we are making progress in our struggle against poverty.
4092,1987-88,Agriculture is the bedrock of our economy.
4093,1987-88,Growth in this sector is also crucial for the removal of poverty.
4094,1987-88,"Our farmers, farm technologists and scientists have 1 I rise to present the Budget for the year 198788."
4095,1987-88,We are proud of them.
4096,1987-88,We have reinforced the policies that have proved so successful.
4097,1987-88,"We are committed to providing remunerative prices, and increased availability of water, power, seeds, fertilizers and credit to our farmers."
4098,1987-88,Foodgrain production will exceed 150 million tonnes despite a poor monsoon.
4099,1987-88,We have increased incentives to our farmers to reduce our dependence on imports of sugar and edible oils.
4100,1987-88,They are subject to exploitation.
4101,1987-88,Government will appoint a National Commission on Rural Labour.
4102,1987-88,It will look into the working conditions of this vulnerable section of our society and the implementation of social legislation for their protection .
4103,1987-88,Major initiatives for modernising industry and stimulating industrial investment were taken in the Sixth Plan.
4104,1987-88,Our strategy in the Seventh Plan is to build on these initiatives to strengthen industrial performance.
4105,1987-88,"We are encouraging economies of scale in production, induction of modern technology and greater competition to increase production, reduce costs and improve quality."
4106,1987-88,We have enhanced the incentives for small scale units.
4107,1987-88,There is clear evidence now that these policies are having the expected impact on the economy.
4108,1987-88,Our industrial base has widened.
4109,1987-88,The small scale sector has expanded rapidly.
4110,1987-88,A large number of new jobs has been created.
4111,1987-88,"In the three years beginning 198485, the growth rate in industry is expected to exceed 8 per cent per annum on average  this has not happened in the last twenty years."
4112,1987-88,We have given high priority to the important task of tax reform.
4113,1987-88,Our tax laws and rules had become complex.
4114,1987-88,"Our reform of the fiscal system, undertaken in the past two years, has been thoroughgoing."
4115,1987-88,We have made tax rates and the tax structure reasonable.
4116,1987-88,We have simplified laws and procedures.
4117,1987-88,We have enforced these laws vigorously without fear or favour.
4118,1987-88,"This has helped the honest tax payer, and yielded more revenue than ever."
4119,1987-88,The public sector is the core of our industrial economy.
4120,1987-88,I am also convinced that our public sector enterprises can be made as efficient as any in the world.
4121,1987-88,I am glad to say that the infrastructure industries in the public sector are showing distinctly better performance.
4122,1987-88,"There has been a significant improvement in productivity in coal, power and railways."
4123,1987-88,The improvement in thermal power generation is particularly striking.
4124,1987-88,The plant load factor in the current year is the highest since 197677.
4125,1987-88,"The improvement in the functioning of infrastructure has been brought about by a change in the management culture, and better performance on the shop floor."
4126,1987-88,Government will further improve the working of public sector enterprises.
4127,1987-88,"We will enhance their autonomy, and make them accountable for results."
4128,1987-88,Government will bring before Parliament a White Paper on the public sector.
4129,1987-88,"As a nation, we have good reason to be satisfied with our economic performance."
4130,1987-88,"During a period when growth rates in many developing countries have declined sharply, we have been able to accelerate growth and increase per capita incomes."
4131,1987-88,"We have avoided debt problems, and have kept inflation under control."
4132,1987-88,Our food stocks and foreign exchange reserves are comfortable.
4133,1987-88,But we cannot afford to be complacent.
4134,1987-88,"The world environment, both political and economic, continues to be unfavourable."
4135,1987-88,There are also important domestic problems that demand our attention.
4136,1987-88,The rapid growth in Government expenditure is exerting mounting pressures on our fiscal balance.
4137,1987-88,"In the recent period, we have been compelled to increase defence expenditure."
4138,1987-88,We shall spare no effort nor shrink from any sacrifice where our national security is concerned.
4139,1987-88,"At the same time, there are pressing requirements for development."
4140,1987-88,Any slackness in critical investments now will cost us heavily in the future.
4141,1987-88,It is a social imperative to spend on programmes which directly benefit the poor and to provide food subsidy.
4142,1987-88,We have had additional commitments arising out of implementation of the Pay Commission’s Report.
4143,1987-88,Higher relief and grants had to be provided to several States severely affected by drought and flood.
4144,1987-88,"Even so, some hard choices have to be made to keep our expenditure within our means."
4145,1987-88,Government is determined to make them.
4146,1987-88,The situation requires a thoroughgoing review of our expenditure policy.
4147,1987-88,Mere scratching the surface will not help.
4148,1987-88,"Ad hoc and across the board cuts of the past, while providing temporary relief, have not yielded enduring results."
4149,1987-88,"There is no room for waste, ostentation or unproductive expenditure."
4150,1987-88,We have to pull together and work harder than ever before to realise national goals.
4151,1987-88,We have a good record in price management.
4152,1987-88,"However, it will be a mistake to take too complacent a view of the price situation."
4153,1987-88,The demand and supply balance in a developing economy is always delicate.
4154,1987-88,Any external or internal disturbance can create difficulties.
4155,1987-88,"It is essential, therefore, to keep a careful watch on the price situation."
4156,1987-88,The balance of payments has been under pressure.
4157,1987-88,We had anticipated this and initiated a range of measures to curb the growth of imports and increase exports.
4158,1987-88,Exports increased by 17 per cent while imports increased by only about 2 per cent in the first nine months of the current year.
4159,1987-88,"The trade deficit is lower than last year by Rs  1,000 crores."
4160,1987-88,But there is much more to be done.
4161,1987-88,Part of the improvement is due to the fall in oil prices and we cannot count on this.
4162,1987-88,Government will remain fully vigilant on the external front.
4163,1987-88,The results of policies initiated in the last two years show that our direction is correct.
4164,1987-88,I propose to use this year’s Budget to provide a new thrust in selected areas which will strengthen the economy and further our Seventh Plan objectives.
4165,1987-88,First among these is education.
4166,1987-88,The New Education Policy has been adopted by Parliament after extensive discussions.
4167,1987-88,It has been evolved from a national consensus.
4168,1987-88,It is a powerful weapon to fight poverty.
4169,1987-88,It gives to the socially and economically weaker sections the means to realise equality of opportunity guaranteed by our Constitution.
4170,1987-88,It will help us preserve our heritage and release the creative energy of our youth.
4171,1987-88,"It will bind together people speaking different languages, professing different faiths and belonging to diverse cultural traditions that are part of the composite culture of India."
4172,1987-88,"It aims at excellence in all fields  science, technology, the arts, humanities and philosophic thought."
4173,1987-88,"To give a good start to the new Policy, I have allocated as much as Rs 800 crores for education as compared with Rs 352 crores in 198687."
4174,1987-88,This massive increase is a measure of our resolve to bring about an educational transformation in our country.
4175,1987-88,State Governments have the primary responsibility for education.
4176,1987-88,These resources will supplement the efforts of State Governments.
4177,1987-88,The momentum of antipoverty programmes will be maintained.
4178,1987-88,"In 1985 86, one million tonnes of foodgrains was provided to States as grant for extending the coverage of the National Rural Employment Programme NREP and the Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme RLEGP, resulting in the creation of 62 million mandays of additional employment."
4179,1987-88,"In 198687, the additional allocation was increased to two million tonnes, leading to additional employment of 128 million mandays."
4180,1987-88,I propose to continue the Programme of allocating additional foodgrains for employment.
4181,1987-88,The Integrated Rural Development Programme will be strengthened further.
4182,1987-88,"This year, more than 3.2 million families are likely to benefit."
4183,1987-88,"In the coming year, an outlay of Rs 310 crores is being provided."
4184,1987-88,"Combined with matching allocations of States and credits from the banking sector, the total flow of funds under this Programme will be 4 to 5 times greater than this allocation."
4185,1987-88,"Total Plan outlay for the Department of Rural Development will exceed Rs 2,000 crores in 198788."
4186,1987-88,"This compares with the total Sixth Plan expenditure of about Rs  3,600 crores."
4187,1987-88,Housing is high on our list of priorities.
4188,1987-88,It is a basic need.
4189,1987-88,"We propose to launch a comprehensive programme for housing development, particularly housing for economically weaker sections."
4190,1987-88,The Central Government has again earmarked Rs 125 crores in 198788 for the Indira Awaas Yojana.
4191,1987-88,"Under this scheme, one million houses will be built during the Seventh Plan period for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes."
4192,1987-88,We have decided that State Governments would be free to use the amounts allocated to them under this Programme as seed capital for launching Indira Awaas Yojana Societies for housing loans for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes.
4193,1987-88,A new financial structure will be created to provide funds for housing.
4194,1987-88,"At the apex level, a new national housing bank will be set up by the Reserve Bank of 4 India with an equity capital of Rs 100 crores."
4195,1987-88,This bank will promote housing institutions at both local and regional levels.
4196,1987-88,The Reserve Bank will be announcing the details separately.
4197,1987-88,"The National Commission on Urbanisation, in its Interim Report, has suggested several changes in the laws affecting housing, including the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, 1976."
4198,1987-88,This important social legislation aimed at using surplus lands in urban areas for the common good.
4199,1987-88,"However, the results achieved have been disappointing."
4200,1987-88,"Although 10 years have passed, less than one half of one per cent of the land declared surplus has actually been used for construction."
4201,1987-88,"Meanwhile, scarcity of land has pushed up rents and speculative profits in urban areas."
4202,1987-88,The worst sufferers have been the poor.
4203,1987-88,"I have asked the Ministry of Urban Development to work out suitable legislative proposals taking into account the recommendations of the Commission, and place these before the House for consideration."
4204,1987-88,"The Commission has also recommended certain changes in the Rent Control Acts which would give protection to the economically weaker sections, while also providing sufficient incentive for new constructions."
4205,1987-88,"These changes should, over time, bring down rents by improving the availability of housing."
4206,1987-88,The report of the Commission will be commended to State Governments.
4207,1987-88,"Later, in my speech, I shall be announcing certain incentives for income tax payers in respect of housing loans taken from specified institutions."
4208,1987-88,"In the last two years, Government has taken a number of measures for workers’ welfare."
4209,1987-88,"These include legislative changes to protect workers’ dues, introduction of a new stock option scheme for workers, increase in eligibility limit for bonus payments, increase in the rate of DA for public sector employees, tax concession for investment in workers’ housing, increase in the interest rate on workers’ Provident Funds and removal of ceiling of houserent allowance for exemption from income tax."
4210,1987-88,"As a further step, I propose to make certain legislative changes in the Incometax Act to protect the dues of workers by way of Provident Fund, ESI and gratuity."
4211,1987-88,We have achieved remarkable success in mobilising small savings.
4212,1987-88,"An expert group, appointed by Government last year, has pointed out certain problems with the present scheme of tax incentives on personal savings."
4213,1987-88,"An important lacuna is that fiscal concessions are currently available for gross savings, with no penalty for dissaving."
4214,1987-88,"It has, therefore, recommended shifting to a system which gives incentives for net savings."
4215,1987-88,I propose to introduce a new savings scheme based on the net saving principle.
4216,1987-88,"To avoid any transitional problems, this scheme will be, for the present, in addition to the existing tax concessions available under Section 80C of the Income tax Act for National Savings Certificates and other instruments."
4217,1987-88,"Under the new scheme, 5 50 per cent of deposits upto a maximum of Rs 20,000 will be eligible for deduction."
4218,1987-88,"However, in the year of withdrawal, 50 per cent of the amount withdrawn will be added to the taxable income ."
4219,1987-88,Receipts under the scheme will be shareable with States.
4220,1987-88,"The full details of the new savings scheme, which will be introduced in the next financial year, are being announced separately."
4221,1987-88,The capital markets in India have shown tremendous growth in the last few years.
4222,1987-88,"Approvals for capital issues have exceeded Rs 5,000 crores in 198687."
4223,1987-88,They were only about Rs 500 crores in 198081.
4224,1987-88,"For a healthy growth of capital markets, investors’ rights must be fully protected."
4225,1987-88,Trading malpractices must be prevented.
4226,1987-88,Government have decided to set up a separate Board for the regulation and orderly functioning of Stock Exchanges and the securities industry.
4227,1987-88,"Last year, the UTI had set up a Mutual Fund for investment in equity to attract small investors."
4228,1987-88,"In order to widen their choice, the State Bank of India will set up a similar Mutual Fund."
4229,1987-88,I shall also be announcing certain measures later which should contribute to the development of capital markets.
4230,1987-88,I have referred to the acceleration in industrial growth.
4231,1987-88,Government’s main thrust is to modernise India’s industrial structure.
4232,1987-88,Efficiency and productivity have to be increased.
4233,1987-88,Existing technology has to be upgraded.
4234,1987-88,New technology has to be absorbed and further developed indigenously.
4235,1987-88,All these objectives can only be realised in a medium term time frame.
4236,1987-88,Government have been carrying out an intensive review of individual industries.
4237,1987-88,"New policy measures have been announced in respect of several important industries, such as, textiles, jute, sugar, drugs, electronics and software."
4238,1987-88,We have also set up the Textile Modernisation Fund and the Jute Modernisation Fund.
4239,1987-88,These will facilitate modernisation of these traditional industries which provide substantial employment.
4240,1987-88,Another special development fund is being set up for jute.
4241,1987-88,This will benefit growers and workers and promote diversification and research and development.
4242,1987-88,"Government will continue to undertake systematic reviews of the total policy framework for selected industries, and take necessary steps to stimulate growth and modernisation."
4243,1987-88,The capital goods industry is central to our efforts for achieving self reliance.
4244,1987-88,I propose to introduce a package of measures to further accelerate the growth of this industry.
4245,1987-88,"First, import duty rates for machinery, including general project imports, are being adjusted."
4246,1987-88,"Second, in order to reduce costs of domestic manufacture in certain critical sectors, such as, power, heavy equipment and textile machinery, cost of certain special types of imported steel is being reduced."
4247,1987-88,I will have more to say on these proposals later.
4248,1987-88,"Third, a special programme of technological upgradation for selected capital goods industries will be launched by financial institutions for the three year 6 period upto the end of this Plan."
4249,1987-88,"This will cover in the first instance electrical machinery, including power equipment and electric motors, foundries and machine tools."
4250,1987-88,"The objective of this programme will be to induct the latest technology in these sectors, improve indigenous R & D facilities for constant upgradation, and reduce costs."
4251,1987-88,The details will be announced separately by the Industrial Development Bank of India.
4252,1987-88,Industries linked to agriculture have a special role in our development.
4253,1987-88,They provide markets for agricultural produce and generate higher incomes for our farmers.
4254,1987-88,"I have already referred to the measures taken for modernisation of two of the most important agrobased industries, namely, jute and textiles."
4255,1987-88,Last year’s budget had provided important tax incentives for use of certain indigenous oils in vanaspati.
4256,1987-88,I shall be announcing certain proposals to encourage the food processing industries.
4257,1987-88,This will benefit the farmer and the consumers.
4258,1987-88,There are other proposals to benefit cotton and wool.
4259,1987-88,"In the past year, Government have taken a number of measures to support export industries."
4260,1987-88,New schemes of cash compensatory support and customs duty drawback have been introduced.
4261,1987-88,Import duties on capital equipment for selected export industries have been reduced.
4262,1987-88,Interest rates have been lowered.
4263,1987-88,Specified raw materials are being provided at international prices.
4264,1987-88,Fiscal incentives have also been extended.
4265,1987-88,Exports are now doing better.
4266,1987-88,"In this Budget, I shall be proposing some further measures for increasing export production."
4267,1987-88,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, these and other budget proposals will strengthen the productive forces in our society."
4268,1987-88,"The fundamental assumption of the Seventh Plan, as indeed of all our Five Year Plans, is that growth and development are the real antidotes to poverty."
4269,1987-88,Direct measures for alleviation of poverty are indispensable in our society.
4270,1987-88,"However, such measures can be sustained only by rapid development."
4271,1987-88,"This was the message that Jawaharlal Nehru gave to the country while introducing the Second Five Year Plan in this House : “We have, therefore, to lay great stress on equality, on the removal of disparities, and it has to be remembered always that socialism is not the spreading out of poverty."
4272,1987-88,The essential thing is that there must be wealth and production....”
4273,1987-88,We can grow faster only if we use modern technology.
4274,1987-88,This is the only way to deal effectively with the problems of unemployment and poverty.
4275,1987-88,"Those wise men who decry the use of modern technology in the name of social justice would do well to listen to Panditji, who in the course of the same speech, said, “Do not imagine that minus technological progress we are going to deal with the problem of unemployment...."
4276,1987-88,"If India is to advance, India must advance in science and technology, and India must use the latest techniques, 7 always keeping in view, no doubt, that in doing so, the intervening period, which always occurs, must not cause unhappiness or misery."
4277,1987-88,This then is our basic strategy  a framework of sustained growth on the basis of rapid modernisation of India’s agriculture and industry.
4278,1987-88,"I am committed to planning for socialism in India, socialism which fits in with our genius but nevertheless socialism in its basic meaning of removing disparities and providing equality of opportunity."
4279,1987-88,This is the yardstick by which I want to judge all policies and programmes.
4280,1987-88,Let me now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198687 and Budget Estimates for 198788.
4281,1987-88,"Budget Estimates 198687 provided for a total expenditure of Rs 52,883 crores."
4282,1987-88,"The expenditure in the current year is likely to exceed the original estimate by Rs 7,445 crores owing to a number of postbudget developments."
4283,1987-88,I do not propose to take the time of the House by going into details as they have been explained in the Budget documents.
4284,1987-88,I shall only refer to certain major items.
4285,1987-88,"Non Plan expenditure is expected to be higher by Rs 5,508 crores including expenditure arising from the recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission."
4286,1987-88,"To reduce the cost of carrying the buffer stock, the Food Corporation of India is being provided loans of Rs 1,200 crores on soft terms."
4287,1987-88,This will replace equivalent bank financing.
4288,1987-88,"For reasons well known to the House, we have increased defence expenditure by Rs 1,466 crores."
4289,1987-88,Interest payments will be higher by Rs 800 crores.
4290,1987-88,"Plan expenditure is likely to be Rs 1,937 crores higher than the original estimates."
4291,1987-88,"Budgetary support for the Central Plan is expected to increase from Rs 13,617 crores to Rs 14,792 crores."
4292,1987-88,"The increase of Rs 1,175 crores is mainly in Telecommunications, Railways, Petroleum, Mines, Textiles and Atomic Energy sectors."
4293,1987-88,Central assistance for State and Union Territory Plans will be Rs 762 crores more mainly because of additional Rs 510 crores of advance Plan assistance to States affected by natural calamities.
4294,1987-88,"Taking Plan and NonPlan together, natural calamities assistance to States will be Rs 640 crores higher than the Budget Estimate of Rs 150 crores."
4295,1987-88,"Coming to receipts, net tax revenue is likely to increase by Rs 1,564 crores compared with the Budget Estimate of Rs 22,643 crores."
4296,1987-88,"This is a large increase, made possible by vigorous implementation of our tax laws."
4297,1987-88,"Non tax revenue and capital receipts including the contributions from the oil sector are estimated at Rs 27,836 crores against the Budget Estimate of Rs 26,537 crores."
4298,1987-88,"The total receipts are placed at Rs 52,043 crores and the total expenditure at Rs 60,328 crores."
4299,1987-88,"Inclusive of Rs 1,200 crores on account of replacement of bank credit for buffer stock by Government loans, the current year is expected to end with a Budgetary Deficit of Rs 8,285 crores."
4300,1987-88,The deficit is high and I do not like it.
4301,1987-88,I have decided that the deficit in the Budget Estimates for 198788 shall not be exceeded.
4302,1987-88,Some supplementary demands are unavoidable; I am instructing the Ministries and other Central Government organisations to ensure that additional demands are offset by equivalent savings or through measures to raise more resources.
4303,1987-88,We will review the financial performance of public sector units to ensure that targets for internal resource generation are met.
4304,1987-88,I am constituting a Cabinet Committee on Expenditure to monitor the implementation of these measures.
4305,1987-88,The overall economic situation is good.
4306,1987-88,Our foodstocks and foreign exchange reserves are quite satisfactory.
4307,1987-88,We have been able to keep the overall price situation under control through judicious demand and supply management.
4308,1987-88,"Along with expenditure control, we will continue to take anticipatory action to reduce excess liquidity and increase supply of sensitive commodities, particularly foodgrains, sugar and edible oils."
4309,1987-88,"Following the report of the Committee on the working of the monetary system, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, it has been decided that henceforth the Budget documents should show the budgetary deficit as well as the net change in the Reserve Bank of India credit to Central Government."
4310,1987-88,The latter presents a more accurate measure of the monetary impact of the Government’s fiscal operations.
4311,1987-88,"According to the present information, it is estimated that the change in the net Reserve Bank of India credit to Central Government in 198687 will be Rs 7,250 crores, which is lower than the budgetary deficit."
4312,1987-88,"For 198788, in the present situation, I have given the highest priority to maintaining the tempo of the Plan."
4313,1987-88,"I have provided an outlay of Rs  24,622 crores for the Central Plan of 198788, of which Rs 14,923 crores will be provided as budgetary support."
4314,1987-88,"With this order of outlay, in the first three years of the Plan, we would have fulfilled about 63 per cent of the Seventh Plan outlay."
4315,1987-88,"However, we now have to make greater efforts to achieve more for every rupee of investment that we make."
4316,1987-88,Achievement of physical targets is far more important than just spending the money.
4317,1987-88,Government must be more cost effective.
4318,1987-88,The cost of delivery of our programmes must be reduced.
4319,1987-88,"The Government has, therefore, given a high priority to implementation of projects in time, avoidance of time and cost overruns in projects, and the use of innovative methods and new technologies."
4320,1987-88,A monitoring system has been set up for projects under implementation.
4321,1987-88,Revised accounting classification to bring about one to one correspondence between heads of accounts and heads of development used for Plan purposes is being introduced from 1.4.1987 in consultation with the Comptroller and Auditor General of 9 India.
4322,1987-88,This will strengthen the planning process and help better monitoring.
4323,1987-88,Equally important is obtaining timely feedback from grass root levels regarding implementation of programmes and flow of benefits therefrom.
4324,1987-88,"In the Central Plan, a high priority has been given to programmes which have an impact on alleviation of poverty in the rural areas."
4325,1987-88,"As I mentioned earlier, particular emphasis has been given to education , the NREP, the IRDP, the RLEGP, rural water supply, and the use of food stocks for creation of additional employment opportunities in the rural areas."
4326,1987-88,Agricultural development has a major impact in alleviating poverty.
4327,1987-88,"In the Central Plan, the accent in the agricultural sector continues to be on increasing productivity by increasing the area under high yielding and improved varieties, accelerated transfer of new technology, increasing crop intensity, diversifying the cropping pattern and control of pests and diseases."
4328,1987-88,"Some of the important programmes under implementation are : Special Rice Production Programme, National Oilseeds Project, National Watershed Development Programme and National Pulses Development Project."
4329,1987-88,"These projects are designed to solve specific agricultural problems, and are already making an impact in our rural areas."
4330,1987-88,Irrigation and fertilizers are two major components of programmes for increasing agricultural productivity.
4331,1987-88,"In irrigation, a high priority is being given to the completion of ongoing projects and for bridging the gap between irrigation potential and its utilisation."
4332,1987-88,Fertilizer production in the current year will increase to nearly 7 million tonnes from about 5.7 million tonnes last year.
4333,1987-88,The fertilizer plant at Paradeep has commenced production during the year.
4334,1987-88,"In the next year, the fertilizer plants at Vijaipur and Aonla  each with a capacity of 7.2 lakh tonnes of urea are expected to be commissioned."
4335,1987-88,"In terms of financial outlays, infrastructure sectors, namely, energy, transport and communications will account for more than 54 per cent of the total Central Plan ."
4336,1987-88,"In 198788, taking the Centre and States together, we will be commissioning 4880 MW of additional power capacity."
4337,1987-88,"In coal, the output per man shift has improved by 11 per cent."
4338,1987-88,The target for coal production in 198788 is 183.5 million tonnes as against 165 million tonnes in 198586.
4339,1987-88,"In the Sixth Plan, we were able to increase our crude oil production nearly threefold."
4340,1987-88,"In the current Plan, production is likely to show a slower increase and it is necessary to accelerate investment in exploration and development of new oil fields."
4341,1987-88,"The total outlay for the petroleum sector as a whole is Rs 3,265 crores next year."
4342,1987-88,"In order to save the time of the House, I have mentioned only a few of the highlights of the Central Plan for 198788."
4343,1987-88,"In several other areas, such as, women and child development, health and family welfare, youth affairs and sports, art and culture, science and technology, environment, social forestry and information and broadcasting, 10 this Government has taken several new initiatives to make the Plan more meaningful to our people."
4344,1987-88,These programmes are being strengthened.
4345,1987-88,"Necessary provisions have also been made for industrial projects, including those in heavy industry, steel and mines."
4346,1987-88,"I am also happy to inform the House that the total Plan outlay of States and Union Territories for 198788 has been fixed at Rs 19,537 crores representing an increase of 17 per cent over the current year."
4347,1987-88,We have taken care of the requirements of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram on being elevated to Statehood.
4348,1987-88,"A provision of Rs 8,754 crores has been made next year for Central assistance for State and Union Territory Plans as against Rs 8,140 crores in the current year’s Revised Estimates."
4349,1987-88,"The Budget Estimate for defence is Rs 12,512 crores in 198788."
4350,1987-88,"This has naturally cast a heavy burden on our budgetary resources, but the House will agree with me that no compromise is possible where country’s defence is concerned."
4351,1987-88,The strength and morale of our Armed Forces are high.
4352,1987-88,"On behalf of this House, I assure our Jawans of the unstinted support of the entire nation."
4353,1987-88,"Interest payments next year are estimated at Rs 10,650 crores against Rs 9,550 crores in the current year."
4354,1987-88,"Food and fertilizer subsidies including arrears, are placed at Rs 3,910 crores as against Rs 3,893 crores in the current year."
4355,1987-88,Next year’s Budget includes a lump provision of Rs 500 crores to cover likely increases in additional dearness allowance to Government employees and also the increases in pensionary charges arising out of the recommendations of the Fourth Pay Commission.
4356,1987-88,This Government  ever sensitive to the difficulties of pensioners has decided to increase the minimum pension and minimum family pension to Rs 375 per month.
4357,1987-88,This will benefit nearly six lakh pensioners.
4358,1987-88,"The total Non Plan expenditure in 198788 is estimated at Rs 39,266 crores."
4359,1987-88,"Tax revenue next year net of States’ share is estimated at Rs 25,689 crores against Rs 24,207 crores in the current year."
4360,1987-88,"Non tax revenue and capital receipts are placed at Rs 31,243 crores against Rs 27,836 crores in the current year."
4361,1987-88,"The total receipts at existing rates of taxation thus amount to Rs 56,932 crores against the total expenditure of Rs 62,942 crores, leaving a gap of Rs 6,010 crores."
4362,1987-88,I shall now turn to my tax proposals.
4363,1987-88,"PART B In the 198586 Budget, we initiated a process of major tax reform."
4364,1987-88,The broad direction and strategy for this reform was set out in the Long Term Fiscal Policy LTFP.
4365,1987-88,We will be introducing a detailed Amendment Bill on Direct Taxes separately in the Budget Session.
4366,1987-88,This Bill will implement wide ranging changes aimed at simplification and rationalisation.
4367,1987-88,The basic thrust of my few Direct Tax proposals is to provide incentives for savings to promote investment and to support housing.
4368,1987-88,I propose to strengthen some welfare measures.
4369,1987-88,I have also included some measures to enhance revenue.
4370,1987-88,I do not propose any changes in the rate structure for Personal and Corporate Taxes.
4371,1987-88,This is in line with the Long Term Fiscal Policy.
4372,1987-88,"In order to conserve foreign exchange and to raise revenue, I propose to levy a modest tax of 15% on foreign exchange released in India for foreign travel."
4373,1987-88,Foreign exchange released for medical treatment and education abroad will be excluded.
4374,1987-88,This tax will be applicable for travel from a date to be notified.
4375,1987-88,The revenue yield from this measure is expected to be Rs  60 crores.
4376,1987-88,Those who can afford to patronize high class hotels should also be afforded the further pleasure of contributing to the national exchequer.
4377,1987-88,A separate legislation will be brought forward for levy of a tax on expenditure in expensive hotels.
4378,1987-88,"This tax, to be levied at 10% of expenditure, will not apply to payments made in foreign exchange."
4379,1987-88,It will become effective after passage of the necessary legislation.
4380,1987-88,I have already mentioned the decision to introduce a new National Savings Scheme based on net savings.
4381,1987-88,Necessary legislative changes are being included in the Finance Bill.
4382,1987-88,I propose to provide a fiscal incentive for channelising savings into the housing sector.
4383,1987-88,"Repayment of loans and payments made to the extent of Rs 10,000 in a year towards the cost of any new residential property will qualify for deduction on the same lines as life insurance premia or contribution to provident fund under Section 80C of the Incometax Act."
4384,1987-88,"This exemption will be within the existing limit of Rs 40,000."
4385,1987-88,Capital gains arising from the sale of a residential house are exempted in case such gains are utilised for acquiring another house.
4386,1987-88,This was hitherto applicable only to individuals.
4387,1987-88,It is now being extended to Hindu Undivided Families.
4388,1987-88,"I understand that for the purpose of taxation of income from houses, our tax laws make a distinction between a real owner who is not a legal owner and a legal owner who is not a real owner."
4389,1987-88,"Following the wellestablished revenue tradition, when it comes to taxing, we tax both the real owner who is not a legal owner and the legal owner who is not a real owner."
4390,1987-88,"Concessions available to a house owner are, however, given only to a real owner who is also a legal owner."
4391,1987-88,"I propose to simplify the law by clarifying that the real owner, even if he is not the legal owner, will pay the tax and avail of the concessions available to the legal owner."
4392,1987-88,I hope this proposal is abundantly clear to the Hon’ble Members.
4393,1987-88,"In cases where the compensation for acquisition of a property is enhanced, or where a new residential house is not acquired within the specified time after selling 12 the old house, the completed tax cases for the past years have to be modified to tax the capital gains accrued earlier."
4394,1987-88,Certain procedural changes are being made in the law to remove this complication.
4395,1987-88,Several important changes have been introduced in the corporate tax structure in the last two years.
4396,1987-88,"With effect from April, 1987, a liberalised set of depreciation rules is being introduced."
4397,1987-88,Depreciation will be allowed in respect of blocks of assets instead of the present system linked to individual assets.
4398,1987-88,"There will be only three rates of depreciation for plant and machinery, namely, 100%, 50% and 331/3%."
4399,1987-88,"Apart from simplifying assessment, this will enable industry to replace and modernise capital equipment faster."
4400,1987-88,It is only fair and proper that the prosperous should pay at least some tax.
4401,1987-88,The phenomenon of socalled “zerotax” highly profitable companies deserves attention.
4402,1987-88,"In 1983, a new Section 80VVA was inserted in the Act so that all profitable companies pay some tax."
4403,1987-88,This does not seem to have helped and is being withdrawn.
4404,1987-88,I now propose to introduce a provision whereby every company will have to pay a “minimum corporate tax” on the profits declared by it in its own accounts.
4405,1987-88,"Under this new provision, a company will pay tax on at least 30% of its book profit."
4406,1987-88,"In other words, a domestic widely held company will pay tax of at least 15% of its book profit."
4407,1987-88,This measure will yield a revenue gain of approximately Rs 75 crores.
4408,1987-88,The capital markets have shown remarkable buoyancy.
4409,1987-88,I propose to make some changes in the Tax Laws which will support healthy development of the capital markets.
4410,1987-88,"The existing provision of allowing deduction in respect of investment in equity shares of certain categories of new companies was to be withdrawn with effect from 1st April, 1987."
4411,1987-88,"In view of the need to continue support for issues of new companies, I propose to extend this concession for 3 more years."
4412,1987-88,I also propose to reduce the holding period of these shares from 5 years to 3 years.
4413,1987-88,At present shares have to be held for a period of 36 months before capital gains on their transfer qualify for the concessional treatment allowed for long term capital gains.
4414,1987-88,It is proposed to reduce the holding period to 12 months.
4415,1987-88,This will provide greater flexibility to investors and also improve the mobility of capital invested in shares.
4416,1987-88,"Concentration of industries in many of our urban areas poses serious problems of congestion, pollution and hazards."
4417,1987-88,"In order to encourage industries to shift out of such areas, I propose to exempt capital gains made on the sale of land and buildings in such areas provided these are reinvested in approved relocation schemes."
4418,1987-88,The provisions regarding additional incometax on undistributed profits of closely held companies have lost their relevance after the reduction in tax rates effected in 198586 Budget.
4419,1987-88,"Because of some court decisions, the capital gains on transfer of goodwill of a concern or transfer of assets from a firm to a partner and viceversa escape the tax net."
4420,1987-88,Such gains will be explicitly taxable.
4421,1987-88,A tax holiday to newly established undertakings in Free Trade Zones has been provided.
4422,1987-88,It is being clarified that this will also extend to units which develop software as also those which assemble or process components for exports.
4423,1987-88,A tax concession is available to the Indian companies earning income from a foreign Government or a foreign enterprise for imparting technical knowhow.
4424,1987-88,This tax concession will now be available only if the foreign exchange earned is repatriated to India.
4425,1987-88,It is also being clarified that an Indian resident cannot be treated as a foreign enterprise for this purpose.
4426,1987-88,It is proposed to exclude computers and machines for transmission and reception of messages from the list given in the Eleventh Schedule of the Incometax Act as these industries are no longer nonpriority.
4427,1987-88,At present Indian citizens earning remuneration in foreign currency for services rendered abroad are allowed 50% exemption under Section 80 RRA of the Incometax Act subject to certain conditions.
4428,1987-88,This is being further liberalised.
4429,1987-88,"The exemption will now be allowed to the extent of 50% of the remuneration, or 75% of the remuneration repatriated in convertible foreign exchange, whichever is higher."
4430,1987-88,"In order to improve coverage and prevent tax evasion, it is proposed that tax at specified rates should be deducted at source in respect of all payments beyond certain prescribed amounts of fees for professional and technical services, royalty, rent, commission or brokerage and payments for goods supplied to Government, etc."
4431,1987-88,"This will apply to payments made by all persons, excepting individuals and Hindu Undivided Families."
4432,1987-88,"Let me now come to measures for the welfare of workers, members of armed forces and the handicapped."
4433,1987-88,There are a number of cases where the employers do not credit their own contributions nor those of the employees to the Provident Fund and the State Insurance Fund.
4434,1987-88,It is also unfortunate that a separate fund is not being kept by some employers in respect of gratuity of workers.
4435,1987-88,"To prevent this anti labour practice, we propose to penalise such delinquent employers by providing that the contributions of the employees to these funds will be taxed as the income of the employer and allowed as a deduction only when they are made over to the separate accounts relating to these funds within the time allowed under the statute."
4436,1987-88,Any compensation received by a workman at the time of his retrenchment is exempt from tax.
4437,1987-88,Similar exemption is being extended to payments made under voluntary retirement schemes for public sector employees.
4438,1987-88,"Regimental Funds or Nonpublic Funds are utilised for purposes such as providing assistance to widows of armed personnel killed in action, as also to disabled soldiers."
4439,1987-88,The contributions will enjoy similar tax concessions as other funds of national importance like the National Defence Fund.
4440,1987-88,"I am increasing the special deduction allowed to the physically handicapped persons and the totally blind from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000. 94."
4441,1987-88,There are other procedural proposals in the area of Direct Taxes including those to ensure better functioning of the Settlement Commission which are in the Bill.
4442,1987-88,"For the Members of Parliament, I propose to introduce a general exemption in respect of Constituency Allowance without reference to any monetary ceiling."
4443,1987-88,The above proposals will give a net revenue gain of Rs 145 crores.
4444,1987-88,Let me now turn to Indirect Taxes.
4445,1987-88,The tariff regime for capital goods will be restructured and rationalised.
4446,1987-88,I propose to extend MODVAT to most of the remaining areas.
4447,1987-88,Excise and Customs duties for certain industries are being adjusted to stimulate growth.
4448,1987-88,There is a package of reliefs for the common man.
4449,1987-88,"As I mentioned earlier, the capital goods industry needs special support."
4450,1987-88,"At present, there are two tariff rates for import of machinery: 101% for import of general machinery and a concessional rate of 55% when machinery is imported for a new project."
4451,1987-88,The low duty rates for project imports have provided a strong encouragement for unnecessary imports.
4452,1987-88,"The differential between the general rate and the project rate also discriminates against modernisation of existing units, and favours sickness."
4453,1987-88,These anomalies must be corrected.
4454,1987-88,I propose to equalise the two rates at 85%.
4455,1987-88,The rate of duty applicable for components will be 15% below the applicable tariff rate.
4456,1987-88,"At present, fertilizers, power and electronics are allowed concessional import duty on their capital goods imports."
4457,1987-88,These rates are being adjusted upwards.
4458,1987-88,"The duty on import of equipment for the electronics industry is being raised from 25% to 30% and for fertilizer plants, it is being increased from zero percent to 15%."
4459,1987-88,"In the case of power, plants of above 50 MW capacity will continue to be imported at 25%."
4460,1987-88,Plants of 50 MW and below will pay a higher duty of 35%.
4461,1987-88,Further concessions are needed to encourage upgradation of technology in specified capital goods sectors.
4462,1987-88,"The duty rate is being reduced to 85% on steels such as boilerspressurevesselsquality plates, sheets or coils, turbine blade flats and stainless steel plates."
4463,1987-88,The textile machinery industry will be allowed supply of imported stainless steel at concessional duty of 65% instead of the prescribed rate of 245% at present.
4464,1987-88,The new technology saves energy and reduces pollution.
4465,1987-88,Specified equipment required for this conversion will be allowed imports at concessional duty of 35% instead of the present 101%.
4466,1987-88,The MODVAT introduced in the 198687 Budget was a major innovation.
4467,1987-88,We covered 38 chapters of the Excise Tariff last year.
4468,1987-88,"I now propose to extend MODVAT to all the remaining chapters except those relating to textiles, tobacco and the petroleum sectors."
4469,1987-88,"MODVAT will now be extended to cover food products, mineral products, leather and travel goods, footwear, paper and paperboard, wood and cork products, asbestos cement products and precious metals."
4470,1987-88,"Last year, in order to ensure revenue neutrality, the introduction of MODVAT was accompanied by an increase in the duty on the final product to balance the setoff being given of the duty paid on inputs."
4471,1987-88,"This year, keeping in view the nature of products, the duty on the final product is not being increased except in a few items."
4472,1987-88,This will reduce the effective duty on a large number of items.
4473,1987-88,"In the case of food products, for example, the total number of items coverd by MODVAT will be over 100."
4474,1987-88,"The duty increase for revenue neutrality is being done only in case of cheese, malt preparations and aerated soft drink."
4475,1987-88,"The effective rate of taxation on other food products, such as biscuits, skimmed milk powder, butter, jams and jellies, and confectionery will be significantly reduced."
4476,1987-88,Farmers and horticulturists are benefited by the expansion of the market of value added food products.
4477,1987-88,Some increase in the final duty is necessary in five of the items which were covered last year where we have found that setoff given last year was very much larger than initially estimated.
4478,1987-88,"These are zincoxide, adhesives based on synthetic resin, organic surfaceactive agents, electric motors and primary batteries."
4479,1987-88,A number of important procedural changes are also being introduced to simplify the operation of MODVAT.
4480,1987-88,Some of the concessions are: 1 Refund in cash of input duty credit if the final product is exported by the manufacturer in certain circumstances.
4481,1987-88,"With these measures, we will have successfully eliminated the cascading effect of excise duty and given a measure of excise relief."
4482,1987-88,Our comprehensive policy package has made electronics one of the fastest growing industries.
4483,1987-88,It has generated substantial employment.
4484,1987-88,I propose to make certain changes which will strengthen the basic design of the existing policy.
4485,1987-88,The list of peripherals is being enlarged and a uniform rate of import duty of 60% is being specified.
4486,1987-88,Import duty on specified datacommunication equipment is being reduced from 140% to 100%.
4487,1987-88,Duty on mechanical parts of datacommunication equipment is being reduced from 140% to 55%.
4488,1987-88,The present notification regarding exemption of import duty on computer peripherals for Research Institutes is being extended by 3 years.
4489,1987-88,Duty on computer systems imported under OGL is being reduced from 150% to 140% basic and auxiliary.
4490,1987-88,Import duty on specified electronic parts of computers is being increased from 25% to 75% in order to give appropriate protection for indigenous production.
4491,1987-88,The import duty on mechanical parts of computer peripherals is also being increased from 5% to 75%; and this is being extended to mechanical parts of CNC system.
4492,1987-88,The Indian computer industry achieved a turnover of Rs 225 crores last passed its infancy and is healthy and vigorous.
4493,1987-88,"Now that the industry has arrived, can the tax collector be far behind?"
4494,1987-88,It is proposed to levy an excise duty of 10% on computers and peripherals.
4495,1987-88,"With MODVAT, the effective incidence of duty will be much lower."
4496,1987-88,The research and development base of the electronics industry is crucial for its longterm success.
4497,1987-88,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the duty on specified equipments required for R&D from 140% to 55%."
4498,1987-88,We must also encourage domestic production of capital goods required for the electronics industry.
4499,1987-88,"At present, mechanical components required for manufacture of such capital goods attract a duty of 140%."
4500,1987-88,I propose to reduce this duty to 45% in the case of components required for nearly 300 specified machines.
4501,1987-88,"In the field of general electronics, a concessional duty structure of 30%, 45% and 75% is allowed for imports of raw materials, pieceparts and components, respectively."
4502,1987-88,We are expanding the coverage of this concessional duty structure by adding some more items.
4503,1987-88,I propose to abolish the excise duty on the production of polysilicon in all forms as a measure of support for the domestic industry.
4504,1987-88,"The customs duty for the import of silicon, solar cells and photovoltaic systems is being fixed at 30%, 45% and 75%, respectively."
4505,1987-88,I propose to increase the duty on the import of polysilicon to 75% for electronics industry in the interest of domestic production.
4506,1987-88,Production of television sets has increased rapidly in line with targets.
4507,1987-88,A thriving and competitive industry has been set up.
4508,1987-88,"I propose to make two changes: i As an antiavoidance measure, it is proposed to impose an excise duty or countervailing duty of Rs 150 on black and white tubes meant for sets of size above 36 cms."
4509,1987-88,"Under MODVAT, this input duty would be fully rebated to dutypaying manufacturers with no additional duty burden on the consumer."
4510,1987-88,"It will, however, help to check unlicensed production."
4511,1987-88,The excise duty on colour television sets exceeding 36 cms.
4512,1987-88,"I propose to increase the duty on costlier sets to Rs 1,750 per set."
4513,1987-88,"This will apply to sets cleared at assessable value higher than Rs 5,000 which corresponds to a retail price of about Rs 7,500."
4514,1987-88,"The excise duty for sets cleared at assessable value of Rs 5,000 or below will remain at Rs 1,500."
4515,1987-88,The costlier sets can bear the extra duty.
4516,1987-88,These proposals relating to the electronics industry will involve a net loss of revenue of Rs 19.30 crores.
4517,1987-88,There will be a revenue gain of Rs 40 crores in excise duty and a loss of Rs 59.30 crores in customs duty.
4518,1987-88,Important developments have taken place in the automobile industry in the past few years.
4519,1987-88,"New technology has been introduced, production has increased and indigenisation is taking place."
4520,1987-88,Government have been reviewing these and other developments and will be announcing a comprehensive policy.
4521,1987-88,"For the present, I have the following tax proposals for automobiles: i At present, a concessional rate of customs duty of 50% is allowed for imported subcomponents required for the manufacture of components for fuelefficient trucks, cars, and twowheelers."
4522,1987-88,I propose to enlarge the list of components eligible for concessional import of subcomponents.
4523,1987-88,This sector can bear the additional duty and it will still benefit from a lower rate than the rest of the industry.
4524,1987-88,"For handicapped individuals, I propose to provide for total exemption from customs duty in respect of automatic transmission and other special equipment to be fitted into fuelefficient cars of engine capacity not exceeding 1000 c.c. iv The rate of duty on import of spares for meeting the aftersales or warranty of fuelefficient motor vehicles is being increased from 50% to 75%."
4525,1987-88,This is an antiavoidance measure with no revenue implication.
4526,1987-88,Plastics are widely used by the common man.
4527,1987-88,They also have a tremendous potential for use in farms and factories.
4528,1987-88,Our plastic prices are high.
4529,1987-88,Government propose to initiate measures to reduce costs in this important area.
4530,1987-88,"I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on PVC resin generalpurpose suspensiongrade from Rs 10,500 per metric tonne to Rs 7,500 per metric tonne."
4531,1987-88,"These resins are used in the manufacture of cheap footwear, pipes for agricultural application and as insulation for wires and cables."
4532,1987-88,I also propose to reduce the basic customs duty on Low Density  Polyethylene LDPE from 100% to 75%.
4533,1987-88,LDPE is used as a base for production of a wide range of packaging materials.
4534,1987-88,LDPE film has a big potential use in the lining of canals and farms and fieldchannels.
4535,1987-88,"The excise duty on products of regenerated cellulose, which includes the cheap packaging materialcellophane, is being reduced from 40% to 20%."
4536,1987-88,"Excise duty is being similarly reduced on cellulose acetate moulding granules which is used for spectacleframes, umbrella handles, toothbrushes and on sodium carboxymethyl cellulose which is used in oildrilling, textiles processing and detergents."
4537,1987-88,"Excise duty on certain varieties of industrial plastics i.e., acrylic and vinyl resin emulsions is being reduced from 40% to 20%."
4538,1987-88,"Over the past year, we have taken a number of steps to strengthen our export performance through fiscal and other means."
4539,1987-88,I propose to give the following additional incentives.
4540,1987-88,For the leather industry  i 31 additional items of machinery required for leather industry will be allowed concessional duty of 35%.
4541,1987-88,The import duty on tyre moulds required for export production is being reduced to 25%.
4542,1987-88,"I also propose to make some adjustments which will further benefit the common man: 1 In August 1985, Government introduced a scheme of fiscal relief for the manufacture of inexpensive blended fabrics Sulabh fabrics."
4543,1987-88,"Under this scheme, NTC mills are supplied raw material free of excise duty for the manufacture of suitings of value upto Rs 45 per metre and shirting of value upto Rs 20 per metre."
4544,1987-88,This scheme has made a good start.
4545,1987-88,It is now proposed to have a similar scheme for manufacture of Sulabh sarees.
4546,1987-88,This will make available goodquality sarees at reasonable prices.
4547,1987-88,"At present, footwear of Rs  45 per pair is exempt from excise duty."
4548,1987-88,I propose to raise the limit to Rs 60 per pair of assessable value which corresponds to footwear retailing at about Rs 100 per pair.
4549,1987-88,"To offset the revenue loss, excise on footwear exceeding this assessable value is being increased to 15% for leather footwear and 20% on footwear of synthetic resins."
4550,1987-88,"I propose to raise the value limit to Rs 12,000 per metric tonne."
4551,1987-88,This should reduce the cost of cheaper toilet and laundry soaps.
4552,1987-88,"Soaps of value between Rs 12,000 per metric tonne and Rs 25,000 per metric tonne will continue to pay duty at 15% but expensive soaps, whose value exceeds Rs 25,000 per metric tonne, will be charged 25%."
4553,1987-88,I propose to raise this limit to Rs 60 per sq. mtr.
4554,1987-88,Shoddy blankets are already fully exempt from excise duty.
4555,1987-88,The other fittings and parts of such tubes will also pay reduced excise duty at the rate of 10%.
4556,1987-88,This would encourage greater use of bio gas.
4557,1987-88,This is an unnecessary burden on our hospitals and clinics.
4558,1987-88,I propose full exemption also for spares and accessories of such lifesaving equipments.
4559,1987-88,I have two proposals for cotton textiles:
4560,1987-88,The excise duty structure on cotton fabrics in the power processing sector is being rationalised.
4561,1987-88,Specific rates of excise duty are being provided in respect of fabrics of value upto
4562,1987-88,Rs 25 per sq. mtr.
4563,1987-88,This will involve a revenue loss of Rs  15 crores.
4564,1987-88,I propose to remove excise duty on wool tops altogether.
4565,1987-88,"However, I propose to increase the customs duty on raw wool, woollen rags and wool waste from 20% to 30% and reduce the customs duty on synthetic rags from 80% to 30%."
4566,1987-88,Excise duty on polyesterwoolblended yarn is also proposed to be reduced from Rs 30 per kg.
4567,1987-88,This will benefit cheaper varieties of woollen textiles.
4568,1987-88,The present rates of duty on viscose staple fibre and viscose filament yarn have not been revised for a number of years.
4569,1987-88,"As a revenue measure, I propose to increase the excise duty on viscose staple fibre from Rs  5 per kg."
4570,1987-88,"Similarly, excise duty on viscose filament yarn is also being increased by about 12.5% of the existing rates."
4571,1987-88,These measures together will give us an additional revenue of Rs  29 crores.
4572,1987-88,"As the House is aware, there is a scheme which has replaced salestax on sugar, tobacco and textiles by an Additional Excise Duty AED."
4573,1987-88,The proceeds of 21 AED go entirely to the State Governments.
4574,1987-88,The AED is required to be raised to reach the agreed level of tax incidence.
4575,1987-88,The rate of duty on costlier fabrics of assessable value exceeding Rs 100 per sq. mtr. is being increased to 20%.
4576,1987-88,The total revenue gain of AED will be Rs  40 crores and will be passed on wholly to State Governments.
4577,1987-88,"I now propose to deal with some other industries which require relief:Ð 1 As a result of recent policies, cement production has grown rapidly benefiting the consumer and converting a sellers market into a buyers market."
4578,1987-88,The newer units in the industry need some support in view of their high capital costs.
4579,1987-88,"I, therefore, propose a rebate of excise duty at the rate of Rs 50 per metric tonne in respect of portland cement manufactured by units commencing production of such cement on or after 1.4.1986."
4580,1987-88,This rebate will be available for a period of three years from 1.3.1987.
4581,1987-88,The levy quota in respect of such units is also being reduced from the existing 30% to 15%.
4582,1987-88,The excise concession will be available only to those units whose aggregate production is not less than 30% of the licensed capacity.
4583,1987-88,"Last year, we introduced a system of rebate in excise duties for vanaspati and soap linked to larger use of minor oils."
4584,1987-88,This has had the desired effect and production of ricebran oil as well as its use in vanaspati and soap have increased considerably.
4585,1987-88,The rebate scheme is being continued this year.
4586,1987-88,There are some procedural changes and the ad valorem duty on vanaspati is being changed to a specific duty.
4587,1987-88,I have already made some proposals in plastics which will help.
4588,1987-88,I further propose to reduce the import duty on specified items of machinery and aseptic packaging from 101% to 50%.
4589,1987-88,"In addtion, I propose to lower the customs duty to 70% on two specified drug intermediates required for the manufacture of pyrazinamide, an antiTB drug."
4590,1987-88,It is proposed to reduce excise duty on unwrought aluminium of CG grade from 13% to 11%.
4591,1987-88,"I propose to reduce excise duty on feature films, including dubbed feature films by about 10% of the existing duty leviable."
4592,1987-88,It is proposed to merge the two existing SSI schemes for the refrigeration and airconditioning appliances and machinery industry into one and to liberalise it.
4593,1987-88,Full exemption from excise duty will now be available for clearance upto Rs  5 lakhs.
4594,1987-88,"Thereafter, 50% of the excise duty leviable will be applicable for clearance between Rs  5 lakhs and Rs  15 lakhs."
4595,1987-88,"Subsequently, the unit will pay the normal duty but eligibility limit for retaining exemption and concessions for the unit will be Rs  40 lakhs."
4596,1987-88,I also propose to reduce customs duty to 25% for plant and equipment needed for manufacture of familyplanning apparatus and appliances and also of equipment using nonconventional energy sources.
4597,1987-88,The same low duty rate is being applied for certain specified sophisticated firefighting equipment for firefighting services administered by Central/State/U.T. Governments and local bodies.
4598,1987-88,"In looking for more revenue, I have to fall back on the ever dependable and reliable friend of Finance Ministers and the certified enemy of Health Ministers."
4599,1987-88,"Lately, I am told, the friendly relationship has been marred by disputes and litigation."
4600,1987-88,I now propose to restore amity between the two by moving over to a new and more rational system of levying excise duties.
4601,1987-88,The existing scheme of excise duty on cigarettes is based on the printed retail price.
4602,1987-88,I propose to move over to an entirely new scheme of specific excise duty based on the length of the cigarette.
4603,1987-88,This is the system prevalent in many countries.
4604,1987-88,"It ensures unambiguous determination of the excise duty, avoiding all problems of determining either assessable value or sale value."
4605,1987-88,"It is proposed that for nonfilter cigarettes of size upto 70mm, the excise duty would be Rs 150 per 1000 cigarettes."
4606,1987-88,"In case of filter cigarettes, the excise duty will be in four slabs namely, upto 70 mm, over 70 upto 75 mm, over 75 upto 85mm, over 85 upto 100mm."
4607,1987-88,"The rates of duty per 1000 filter cigarettes in these slabs will be Rs 200, Rs 300, Rs 400 and Rs 600, respectively."
4608,1987-88,"The tariff rate for cigarettes is Rs 700 and, therefore, nonfilter cigarettes beyond 70 mm length and filter cigarettes beyond 100 mm length will pay the tariff rate."
4609,1987-88,This scheme will be a major simplification and rationalisation measure.
4610,1987-88,"Incidentally, it will also yield additional revenue to Government of Rs 200 crores!"
4611,1987-88,I will now mention some other measures largely of rationalisation:Ð 1 Denudation of our forests is causing serious damage to our environment.
4612,1987-88,The tax structure must also make a contribution towards preservation of our forest wealth.
4613,1987-88,"With this objective in view, we have rationalised the duty structure on wood products."
4614,1987-88,"I propose to levy a uniform rate of excise duty of 20% on wood products based on waste wood such as particleboard, insulation and hard boards and fibreboards."
4615,1987-88,A higher rate of 30% will be levied on all plywoods made from prime timber.
4616,1987-88,I invite suggestions from Members and other conservationists and I am prepared to take further measures which would implement this policy objective.
4617,1987-88,A large number of exemption notifications in customs have the effect of lowering the rate of duty below 25% for many items.
4618,1987-88,"In order to prevent invoicing malpractices, rates of duty should not be below 25% except in very special circumstances."
4619,1987-88,"Accordingly, duty rates are being raised to 25% for 7 items."
4620,1987-88,"In a few other cases, the duty rates have been reviewed and increased."
4621,1987-88,"The concessional rate of 25% basic in respect of soda ash will continue until 31st March, 1988."
4622,1987-88,The 70% concessional duty on 13 specified parts of mechanical and quartz analogue wrist watches will continue for another year with certain modifications.
4623,1987-88,The rate of duty is being enhanced to 100% for three specified parts.
4624,1987-88,The concessional rate in respect of certain other parts of wrist watches is being withdrawn altogether.
4625,1987-88,"The excise duty on aerated soft drink is being increased by 20 paise per bottle and in the case of soda, by 15 paise per bottle."
4626,1987-88,"Soda and soft drinks in packagings other than bottles will have a duty of 60% and 75%, respectively."
4627,1987-88,MODVAT benefits will now be available to these items.
4628,1987-88,"Hence, the effective incidence will be considerably lower."
4629,1987-88,"The list of such processed and relatively expensive packaged foods is being extended to noodles, spaghetti, macaroni, vermicelli, flakes of cereals, readyto cook food mixes, etc. put up for sale in unit containers."
4630,1987-88,This is necessitated by the upward revision of domestic aluminium prices to equate the landed cost of imported metal with the statutory price per tonne.
4631,1987-88,"Even at the revised rate, the ad valorem incidence of excise duty will be lower than on the steel produced by integrated plants because of substantial MODVAT credit and higher prices."
4632,1987-88,I am also taking this opportunity to bring the surplus of the Oil Pool Account into the taxnet.
4633,1987-88,This will have no effect on consumer prices.
4634,1987-88,This surplus presently accrues to Government as nontax receipts.
4635,1987-88,I now propose to raise the customs duty on imported crude petroleum by Rs 500 per tonne.
4636,1987-88,I also propose to increase the ceiling limits upto which excise duty by way of cess for the development of oil industry may be levied on crude oil and natural gas produced in India.
4637,1987-88,The limits are proposed to be raised from Rs 300 per tonne to Rs 1000 per tonne on crude oil and from Rs 50 to Rs 300 per thousand cubic metres on natural gas.
4638,1987-88,"The effective rate of cess on crude oil is proposed to be raised from 1st March, 1987 from Rs 300 to Rs 600 per tonne."
4639,1987-88,The proposals are expected to yield Rs 800 crores by way of customs duty and Rs 900 crores by way of cess with an equivalent reduction in non tax receipts.
4640,1987-88,These increases will be absorbed fully by the Pool Account and will not affect prices paid by the consumer in any way.
4641,1987-88,"Apart from the above proposals, I have proposed certain amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect changes in the excise and customs tariffs."
4642,1987-88,These amendments are merely enabling provisions and have no revenue significance.
4643,1987-88,"Besides, there are several proposals for amendments in existing notifications, excise rules which have merely procedural significance."
4644,1987-88,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
4645,1987-88,Provision in the Finance Bill is also being made for continuation of the levy of auxiliary duty of customs and Special Excise duty.
4646,1987-88,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from 1st March, 1987, will be laid on the table of the House in due course."
4647,1987-88,My proposals in respect of Customs and Central Excise duties outlined above are likely to yield additional revenue of Rs 531.73 crores from Customs duties and Rs 431.80 crores from Excise duties.
4648,1987-88,The concessions and reliefs aggregate Rs 464.81 crores on the Customs side and Rs 130.00 crores on the Excise side.
4649,1987-88,"The net additional revenue from Customs duties thus would be Rs 66.92 crores and that from Excise duties, Rs 301.80 crores."
4650,1987-88,"In Excise duties, the Centre’s share would be Rs 109.48 crores and that of States, Rs 192.32 crores."
4651,1987-88,"Out of the total net additional 25 yield of Rs 368.72 crores, Centre’s share would be Rs 176.40 crores and that of the States, Rs 192.32 crores."
4652,1987-88,"I had earlier mentioned that the Budget deficit at the existing rates of taxes would be Rs 6,010 crores."
4653,1987-88,"The proposed tax measures, taken together with reliefs, are estimated to yield net additional revenue of Rs 322 crores to the Centre."
4654,1987-88,"This will leave an uncovered deficit of Rs 5,688 crores."
4655,1987-88,This is significantly lower than the deficit for the current year.
4656,1987-88,"As mentioned earlier, I have decided that this shall not be exceeded."
4657,1987-88,I have set in motion measures to implement this decision.
4658,1987-88,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am conscious of the enormous challenges that confront our economy."
4659,1987-88,Some are inherent in the process of planned development in a democracy.
4660,1987-88,But some are in the nature of a price that we have to pay for pursuing an independent foreign policy.
4661,1987-88,The people of India have asserted their independence and willingly accepted these burdens.
4662,1987-88,"Their heroic exertions, their sacrifices, and their unshakable confidence in their capacity to build the India of their dreams are a source of strength, inspiration and direction to me."
4663,1987-88,Let us move forward with determination.
4664,1987-88,I commend the Budget to the House.
4665,1988-89,The Economic Survey for 198788 was placed before the House a few days ago and contains a detailed review of trends in the Indian economy over the past year.
4666,1988-89,Economic performance and management during the year have been dominated by natural calamities of drought and floods.
4667,1988-89,"The drought this year has been one of the worst in this century, with 21 out of 35 meteorological subdivisions receiving deficient or scanty rainfall during the monsoon months."
4668,1988-89,"In most of the Eastern states the problem was not too little but, rather, too much rainfall, leading to devastating floods."
4669,1988-89,"What is worse, this year of drought and floods followed three successive years of poor monsoon."
4670,1988-89,It has done so for two good reasons.
4671,1988-89,"First, sustained development and diversification of our economy, over the years, has created a capacity to withstand temporary shocks."
4672,1988-89,"Second, Government has responded with timely interventions across a wide front to contain the economic and social costs of the drought."
4673,1988-89,"The buffer stock policy pursued by the Government enabled us to build large food stocks, which stood at 23 million tonnes on 1st July, 1987."
4674,1988-89,"With the help of these stocks, a massive and sustained effort was launched to ensure adequate supply of foodgrains throughout the country, particularly in drought affected areas."
4675,1988-89,"Other important Government programmes to combat the drought included massive expansion of relief and employment generating works, strengthening of the public distribution system, special efforts to compensate for shortages of drinking water, fodder and power supply, action plans to grow contingency crops in the kharif season and to boost rabi production, measures for livestock protection and large scale imports of essential commodities such as edible oils and pulses."
4676,1988-89,"These supply measures were buttressed by careful fiscal and monetary policies to make available adequate resources for relief expenditures, without cutting back on the public investment programme."
4677,1988-89,"Thus, despite the decline in agricultural production, GNP growth in 198788 is expected to be in the range of 1 to 2 per cent, in contrast to a decline of 4.7 per cent in 197980."
4678,1988-89,Available data show that industrial production in AprilNovember 1987 rose by 10.2 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.
4679,1988-89,"In contrast, in the drought year 197980, there was an absolute decline of 1.7 per cent in industrial production."
4680,1988-89,"The overall rate of inflation in the current financial year, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index, stood at 9.8 per cent as on February 6, 1988 as compared with inflation in excess of 21 per cent recorded in 197980."
4681,1988-89,Price movements in respect of essential commodities are being monitored closely at Central and State levels and I would like to thank State Governments for setting up control rooms at the district level also.
4682,1988-89,We have to keep continuous vigilance on the price front at all levels.
4683,1988-89,The strains imposed by the drought and floods have highlighted some of the underlying strengths as well as problem areas of our economy.
4684,1988-89,"In the face of successive monsoon failures, our agriculture has demonstrated its basic strength."
4685,1988-89,We are proud of our farmers.
4686,1988-89,"By their hard work and unflinching determination through the years, they produced enough to enable us to build substantial food stocks."
4687,1988-89,This helped us to withstand the impact of the current drought without acute food scarcity and widespread economic dislocation.
4688,1988-89,The infrastructure has performed well.
4689,1988-89,"Generation of thermal power has made up the deficiency in generation of hydel power and, overall, there was a growth of 7.6 per cent in power generation in the first nine months of the current year."
4690,1988-89,Productivity in the Railways has shown significant improvement.
4691,1988-89,"Coal production has increased by 10.2 per cent in AprilDecember,1987."
4692,1988-89,"The improvement shown by the public sector in these areas is a matter of considerable satisfaction, and bears testimony to the successful implementation of policies initiated by this Government."
4693,1988-89,"Our workers have worked hard to make this possible, and the nation is grateful to them."
4694,1988-89,Government attaches the highest importance to building a strong and vibrant public sector.
4695,1988-89,Exports have recorded strong growth over the last two years.
4696,1988-89,"After growing by over 15 per cent in 198687, exports rose by nearly 25 per cent in the first nine months of the current year as compared to the corresponding period of the previous year."
4697,1988-89,"Over the same period, the growth of imports was less than 14 per cent."
4698,1988-89,The trade deficit has been declining over the past two years.
4699,1988-89,"However, we must not be complacent."
4700,1988-89,"As we look ahead, we must move decisively to overcome some of the problems that have emerged on the economic scene."
4701,1988-89,"The four successive years of poor monsoons have caused considerable hardship in our rural areas, reduced agricultural output, and affected the momentum of growth."
4702,1988-89,"We, therefore, have to give a major thrust to agriculture in the remaining years of the Seventh Plan."
4703,1988-89,We have done well in agriculture.
4704,1988-89,But the drought and floods have highlighted certain areas which require our urgent attention.
4705,1988-89,"The Prime Minister has 2 directed that an Action Plan should be formulated quickly by the Planning Commission, which would identify the areas where further measures can lead to early gains in production."
4706,1988-89,"In 198788, an additional allocation of Rs 236 crores has been made for completion of irrigation projects in drought affected States."
4707,1988-89,"In the coming year, Plan outlays for Centre and States in respect of agriculture and irrigation are being increased by 40 per cent."
4708,1988-89,"If necessary, the Government will make reallocations within the overall Plan outlay for 198889 and provide more resources for achieving agricultural targets."
4709,1988-89,"We have seen rapid growth in industry, reflecting the success of Government policies in stimulating investment and production, and promoting technological upgradation."
4710,1988-89,We must ensure that this momentum is maintained.
4711,1988-89,Costs and prices need to be reduced.
4712,1988-89,Indian Industry must be made more competitive.
4713,1988-89,Sickness in industry has been a major problem.
4714,1988-89,We have to take further steps to combat sickness.
4715,1988-89,"We must also upgrade skills, train workers and improve management."
4716,1988-89,"Industrial development must make the best use of our most abundant resource, namely, the skills of our people."
4717,1988-89,Rapid growth of industry is essential for generating employment opportunities.
4718,1988-89,"Small, village and khadi industries have a special place in our economic development."
4719,1988-89,These industries make use of locally available resources and are instrumental in creating job opportunities in smaller towns and rural areas where the bulk of our people live.
4720,1988-89,"Speaking in this house, thirty five years ago, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru had told the nation, and I quote, “I have no doubt that we cannot raise the people’s level of existence without the development of major industries in this country; in fact, I will go further and say that we cannot even remain a free country without them..........."
4721,1988-89,But we must always remember that the development of heavy industry does not by itself solve the problem of the millions in this country.
4722,1988-89,"We have to develop the village and cottage industry in a big way, at the same time making sure that in trying to develop industry, big and small, we do not forget the human factor.”"
4723,1988-89,This overall approach continues to guide us.
4724,1988-89,"Government has been taking several measures to increase revenue, improve tax compliance and enforce economic laws."
4725,1988-89,These have yielded dividends and growth of revenue in the past three years has been quite satisfactory.
4726,1988-89,"The faster growth of expenditure has, however, exerted substantial pressures on the fiscal situation."
4727,1988-89,"We face unavoidable compulsions of higher expenditure, for example, on defence, development, social services, relief programmes and food and fertilizer subsidies."
4728,1988-89,"As a nation, we must deal earnestly with the problem of mounting expenditure."
4729,1988-89,"As anticipated, the balance of payments situation has been under strain because of several factors."
4730,1988-89,"These include higher imports of edible oils and pulses, 3 increase in imports of crude oil and petroleum products, increasing protectionist tendencies abroad, and unfavourable climate for official development assistance."
4731,1988-89,"The environment for developing countries has also been badly affected by upheavals in the international economy, volatility of exchange rates, and slow growth of world trade."
4732,1988-89,"In order to reduce the impact of these unfavourable developments, we took vigorous measures to increase exports and reduce the growth of imports."
4733,1988-89,These measures would need to be further strengthened.
4734,1988-89,India has followed a prudent policy in debt management and has avoided problems of the kind faced by several other developing countries.
4735,1988-89,We remain committed to ensuring longterm viability in our balance of payments.
4736,1988-89,"The challenges before us are many and it is only through hard work, thrift and sacrifice that we can build a selfreliant, strong and socialist economy."
4737,1988-89,"As a humble political worker, I am conscious that while we have made tremendous progress, there is a great deal that remains to be done to improve the condition of our people, particularly in rural areas."
4738,1988-89,"Within the limitation imposed by our overall resource situation, I propose to take a number of steps to benefit farmers, promote small and village industries, provide relief to the poor, protect and create more jobs, and generate self employment opportunities for our people."
4739,1988-89,"In addition to augmenting the antipoverty programmes, such as IRDP, NREP and RLEGP, Government has decided to initiate a number of measures to increase the flow of agricultural credit, strengthen the institutional framework, enhance social security to the weaker and vulnerable sections of the society, particularly Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, and promote better housing for the rural poor."
4740,1988-89,"While some of these programmes call for additional outlays, it is proposed to reorient and redirect several of the existing programmes and institutions to serve our social objectives better."
4741,1988-89,"In working out the package of measures for agriculture, we have kept in view the guidelines given by the Prime Minister when he addressed the kisans the other day: ÞBÉEßÉÊKÉ"
4742,1988-89,"BÉEÉä +ÉMÉãÉä nÉä iÉÉÒxÉ oÉÉãÉÉå àÉå ABÉE VÉÉä®nÉ® xÉaÉÉ |ÉÉäioÉÉcxÉ ÉÊnaÉÉ VÉÉA, ÉÊVÉoÉàÉå UÉä]ä"
4743,1988-89,BÉEÉä <oÉBÉEÉ ãÉÉ£É ÉÊàÉãÉäMÉÉ +ÉÉè® {ÉÚ®É oÉàÉÉVÉ
4744,1988-89,"Special attention must be given to small and marginal farmers, landless labourers and village artisans."
4745,1988-89,It shall also be our endeavour that our schemes for rual development benefit not only all the regions of the country but also all the sections of the society.
4746,1988-89,This will strengthen and benefit the entire community and help us march forward.
4747,1988-89,The financial condition of our farming community has been affected by the drought.
4748,1988-89,"A number of measures have already been taken such as reschedulement of loans, conversion of short term loans into term loans and lowering of rate of interest in some cases."
4749,1988-89,"As an important step forward, I am happy to inform the House that today the Reserve Bank of India is issuing instructions to bring down the cost of agricultural credit."
4750,1988-89,"The rate of interest on crop loans upto Rs 7,500 is being reduced by one and half per cent to two and half per cent."
4751,1988-89,"The interest rate will, henceforth, be reduced to 10 per cent for loans upto"
4752,1988-89,"Rs 7,500 from the prevailing levels of 11.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent."
4753,1988-89,"Similarly, for crop loans above Rs 7,500 and upto Rs 15,000, interest rate will be reduced to 11.5 per cent from 12.5 per cent to 14 per cent."
4754,1988-89,"This reduction in interest rates will benefit crores of agricultural borrowers from cooperative sector, Regional Rural Banks and commercial banks, and provide much needed relief to them."
4755,1988-89,"In order to increase the flow of credit at reduced cost, it has also been decided that the target for direct finance to agriculture by public sector banks should be raised to 17 per cent of their total outstanding advances by the end of 198889."
4756,1988-89,"Together with added efforts by regional rural banks and cooperative banks, the target for availability of direct credit by banks to agriculture will increase by over Rs 3,000 crores in 198889."
4757,1988-89,"In order to further reduce the cost of inputs, Government is asking the fertilizer companies, in both public and private sectors, to give a discount of 7.5 per cent over notified prices for coming Kharif and Rabi sowings."
4758,1988-89,This will reduce the price of a bag of urea by around eight rupees and eighty paise.
4759,1988-89,The companies should be able to absorb the cost of this discount through better inventory management.
4760,1988-89,I am sure our enterprising farmers will take advantage of this discount and increase agricultural production.
4761,1988-89,Timely use of pesticides and weedicides has an important role in preventing crop damage and improving productivity on our farms.
4762,1988-89,"In order to lower their cost, I will be announcing later in my speech, reduction in import duties on selected pesticides/ weedicides as well as intermediates."
4763,1988-89,"At the same time, selected pesticide items, considered important for agriculture, will be allowed to be imported freely by designated state and cooperative agencies."
4764,1988-89,This will ensure that the existing manufacturers do not indulge in monopolistic practices.
4765,1988-89,This measure will help our farmers.
4766,1988-89,"In consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, NABARD, the State Bank of India and the Commercial banks, I am happy to announce a new strategy on rural credit designed to serve every village of the country."
4767,1988-89,"The commercial banks and the Regional Rural banks together have over 40,000 branches in the rural and semi urban areas of the country."
4768,1988-89,The number of villages exceeds five lakhs and seventy six thousand.
4769,1988-89,"Under the proposed dispensation, each bank branch in the country will have a designated service area of about 15 to 25 villages, as required, in the neighbourhood 5 of the branch."
4770,1988-89,The branch will be primarily responsible for meeting the appropriate credit needs of its service area.
4771,1988-89,"This countrywide arrangement, supervised by the District Lead Bank Scheme already operational, and further supplemented by the rural cooperatives, will go a long way to serve the credit needs of the village community."
4772,1988-89,"To help farmers affected by drought, we have given a number of reliefs and concessions by way of rescheduling of loans, postponement of all recoveries, and reduction in interest rates."
4773,1988-89,It has been a long standing demand of farmers and the cooperative movement that a separate National Agricultural Credit Relief Fund should be established to provide relief on a systematic basis.
4774,1988-89,I am happy to announce that it has now been decided to set up such a Fund.
4775,1988-89,The corpus of the Fund will be provided by the Central and State Governments on an agreed basis.
4776,1988-89,The criteria for releasing money from the Fund will be worked out by the Reserve Bank of India.
4777,1988-89,"Before I turn to other matters, I would like to refer to a subject which has been close to our hearts."
4778,1988-89,"I have a feeling that the cooperative credit system, which played such a pioneering role in the early years of our Independence, has not grown as fast as it could have."
4779,1988-89,Cooperatives are the best instruments for reaching our farmers; they are also a symbol of selfreliance at the village level.
4780,1988-89,I believe that we must now devote special attention to revitalising the entire cooperative sector.
4781,1988-89,"I would invite the Hon’ble Members to give this matter their personal attention and also request them to send me suggestions regarding the role that the Reserve Bank of India, NABARD and the nationalised banking sector, should play in promoting the growth of the cooperative movement."
4782,1988-89,"I shall also be writing to State Governments, who have a major responsibility in this area."
4783,1988-89,The programme of rural electrification has enabled countrywide utilisation of ground water for irrigation with the help of electric pump sets.
4784,1988-89,"However, some of the poorer farmers have often been unable to afford the one time cost of pump set installation."
4785,1988-89,A special programme to be called JALDHARA will be launched to assist marginal farmers in drought prone areas.
4786,1988-89,This scheme will provide them the benefits of pump sets for irrigation on nominal rental / lease charges.
4787,1988-89,It is proposed that during 198889 the benefits of this scheme will be provided to about fifty thousand farming families.
4788,1988-89,"To improve the quality of life of rural families below the poverty line, including Harijans and Adivasis families, I propose a massive programme to be called KUTIRJYOTI for extending single point light connections to households of their families."
4789,1988-89,The programme will meet the one time cost of internal wiring and service connection charges.
4790,1988-89,"In 198889, five lakh households are proposed to be covered by this programme."
4791,1988-89,The cost of both the JALDHARA and KUTIRJYOTI will be met through a combination of grants and loans to the State Electricity Boards by the Rural Electrification Corporation.
4792,1988-89,People living in hill areas have to bear the burden of higher transport costs in the supply of Kerosene and LPG.
4793,1988-89,"Today, freight subsidy is given on Kerosene to North Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir."
4794,1988-89,It has now been decided to extend this concession to all hill areas.
4795,1988-89,"Similarly, it has been decided that LPG cylinders would be supplied to the customers in all hill areas at the same price as for the customers in the nearest point in the plains."
4796,1988-89,"This will also, to a large extent, help in conserving the forest resources used for purposes of light and fuel."
4797,1988-89,"In his budget speech last year, the Prime Minister emphasized the high priority of the housing sector and had announced the decision to set up a National Housing Bank with an initial capital of Rs 100 crores."
4798,1988-89,"Necessary legislation has been passed, and the Bank will become operational shortly."
4799,1988-89,"In order to give a special thrust to rural housing, the Reserve Bank of India, along with some financial institutions, will make a special additional contribution of Rs 100 crores to the National Housing Bank."
4800,1988-89,"This entire additional amount will be used for promotion of rural housing in several ways, including setting up of specialised rural housing savings and loan institutions,if necessary."
4801,1988-89,"In this context, it is also proposed to extend the role of the Land Development Banks to cover the field of housing finance for farmers."
4802,1988-89,"These banks exist in most districts, have strong apex bodies and deal directly with the rural population."
4803,1988-89,They can also mobilise resources for housing finance.
4804,1988-89,The State Governments will be requested to carry out necessary legislative measures to permit Land Development Banks to undertake housing finance.
4805,1988-89,"A new programme of housing for small and marginal farmers with monthly income of upto Rs 700, is being launched by Housing and Urban Development Corporation."
4806,1988-89,"Under this programme, HUDCO will provide assistance, upto specified amounts, at low rate of 7 per cent interest repayable in 22 years for building or improving a house."
4807,1988-89,"Assistance will also be given for improvement of old homes, for example, change of roof from thatch to tile."
4808,1988-89,"A new scheme, called the “Village Abadi Environmental Improvement Scheme” will be launched by HUDCO this year."
4809,1988-89,"Projects involving expenditure upto Rs 2,000 per family in villages with population not exceeding 5,000, for improving rural abadi infrastructure like drainage, sanitation etc., will be supported."
4810,1988-89,The equity base of HUDCO will be suitably strengthened to help finance these programmes.
4811,1988-89,"Commercial Banks have also been providing help for rural housing, both directly as well as through HUDCO."
4812,1988-89,"With their vast branch network in rural areas, their role should be further enhanced."
4813,1988-89,"Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that, it has been decided that commercial banks will increase their lending for the housing sector to an annual level of Rs 300 crores by the end of the Seventh Plan."
4814,1988-89,There is great scope for using local lowcost materials in housing.
4815,1988-89,Our scientists and engineers have also developed considerable expertise in lowcost housing 7 technology.
4816,1988-89,It has been decided to set up a national network of Nirman or Nirmithi Kendras which will provide easy access to lowcost housing materials and techniques.
4817,1988-89,It is proposed to set up one Kendra in each district.
4818,1988-89,"In the coming year, 100 Kendras will be set up."
4819,1988-89,"Landless labourers, artisans and other very poor families in rural areas face acute financial distress when their huts and belongings are destroyed by fire."
4820,1988-89,I am glad to inform the House that it is proposed to launch a new scheme to provide fire insurance protection to them.
4821,1988-89,The Government of India will bear the entire premium cost.
4822,1988-89,The scheme will be implemented by the General Insurance Coporation of India and its four subsidiaries.
4823,1988-89,The GIC will separately announce the details of the scheme.
4824,1988-89,I also propose to take a major new initiative for extending the system of social security to the weaker sections of our society.
4825,1988-89,"The Life Insurance Corporation of India, which has done so much to spread insurance culture throughout the length and breadth of our country, will be setting up a separate “Social Security Fund” with a corpus of Rs 100 crores."
4826,1988-89,Certain changes are being made in the Income tax payable by the Life Insurance Corporation of India to make this possible.
4827,1988-89,The Fund will be used for financing life insurance schemes for weaker and vulnerable sections of the population at subsidised rates.
4828,1988-89,"The House will agree with me that the creation of such a fund will provide a solid foundation for extending insurance cover to the toiling sections of our society, for example, landless labourers, handloom workers, rickshaw pullers, drivers etc. who work on daily wages or whose employment is casual."
4829,1988-89,"In respect of these group insurance schemes, 50 per cent of the premium will be adjusted from the newly created Social Security Fund, the balance 50 per cent of the premium being payable by the beneficiaries concerned."
4830,1988-89,"Group insurance schemes will also be introduced for groups with regular incomes like primary school teachers, cooperative milk producers, and workers in shops and commercial establishments."
4831,1988-89,"Schemes will also be formulated for the benefit of artisans, tailors, barbers, masons, carpenters and other similar groups."
4832,1988-89,"While IRDP extends benefits to the families of the poor, these families face hardship in the event of sudden death of the head of the family."
4833,1988-89,"To give greater security to the family, a group insurance scheme of the LIC is proposed to be introduced to cover around 3 to 4 million families under IRDP assistance every year with effect from 1.4.1988."
4834,1988-89,"The insurance cover will be Rs 3,000, with double benefit in case of accidental death."
4835,1988-89,I would now like to propose some measures specifically for the benefit of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4836,1988-89,Many Statelevel Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance/Development Corporations are doing a good job in looking after the special requirements of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4837,1988-89,I now propose setting up a National Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Finance and Development Corporation.
4838,1988-89,This corporation will play a catalytic role in developing 8 schemes for employment generation and financing pilot programmes which can then be taken up by the State level Corporations and other agencies active in this field.
4839,1988-89,This Corporation will also work with nationalised banks and NABARD in improving the flow of financial assistance to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4840,1988-89,"The objective would be to innovate, experiment and promote rather than replicate the work of the existing agencies."
4841,1988-89,I am making a provision of Rs 50 crores in the next year’s budget for this Corporation.
4842,1988-89,Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that we propose to initiate a project for one million wells under the National Rural Employment Programme and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme by raising the percentage of allocation of funds for the exclusive benefit of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from 10 per cent to 20 per cent.
4843,1988-89,"It is fitting that in the year of Fortieth Anniversary of Independence, we initiate this massive programme of construction of wells which will benefit millions of small and marginal farmers belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."
4844,1988-89,I would now like to announce some measures for promotion of employment opportunities in the decentralised sector.
4845,1988-89,The handloom sector provides employment to about 10 million weavers and others.
4846,1988-89,This important sector has been affected by high prices of cotton and other yarns.
4847,1988-89,I propose to increase the subsidy on Janata cloth from Rs 2 per sq.metre to Rs 2.75 per sq. metre.
4848,1988-89,The impact of this relief will be Rs 40 crores.
4849,1988-89,"Later, in my speech, I shall be announcing a package of measures which will benefit the handloom sector by reducing the cost of certain types of yarns."
4850,1988-89,"At present, a standard rebate of 10 per cent is being provided for Khadi."
4851,1988-89,I propose to extend this rebate to Kambals and Kambalis.
4852,1988-89,It has been a long standing demand of the tiny and small industries that there should be a separate apex bank for them.
4853,1988-89,Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that it has now been decided to establish a Small Industries Development Bank of India.
4854,1988-89,The new bank will be a subsidiary of the Industrial Development Bank of India.
4855,1988-89,"The equity of the new bank will be Rs 250 crores, and it will have its own separate Board of Directors, including representatives from the small scale sector."
4856,1988-89,"The new Bank will also administer both the Small Industries Development Fund established in May, 1986 and the National Equity Fund for providing equity support to projects in tiny and small scale sector."
4857,1988-89,New small scale units often experience problems and delays in securing working capital finance.
4858,1988-89,"In order to overcome this difficulty, it has been decided that requirements of working capital upto Rs 2.5 lakhs for new tiny and small scale units, whose project cost does not exceed Rs 5 lakhs, will be provided through a single window."
4859,1988-89,"Thus, both term loans and working capital will be made available by the same bank or institution."
4860,1988-89,The details of this scheme will be announced by Industrial Development Bank of India shortly.
4861,1988-89,A healthy capital goods sector is a prerequisite for selfreliance.
4862,1988-89,"Last year, while presenting the Budget, the Prime Minister announced a package of measures to revitalise the machine building industries."
4863,1988-89,"Later in my speech, I shall be announcing certain measures which will carry this process further for revitalising industries such as paper, cement, and textiles."
4864,1988-89,"These measures will help to stimulate demand, lower costs and improve efficiency."
4865,1988-89,The Capital market is an important source for mobilisation of savings for industry and Government has taken several steps to strengthen it.
4866,1988-89,"Last year, the Prime Minister announced the decision to set up a separate Board for the regulation and development of the Stock Exchanges."
4867,1988-89,Necessary legislation in this regard is under preparation and the Board is expected to become operational soon.
4868,1988-89,"Measures have also been taken to set up Mutual Funds, lay down ground rules for orderly operations of the Stock Exchanges, improve their infrastructure, facilitate share transfers and enforce better discipline on companies entering the market."
4869,1988-89,"Later in my speech, I shall be announcing certain further measures which will help to boost investment in new industries and generate more employment and economic activity."
4870,1988-89,We have one of the largest pools of scientific and technical manpower.
4871,1988-89,"Yet, many of our young and new entrepreneurs find it difficult to raise equity capital because of the risk involved."
4872,1988-89,This problem can be solved by allowing Venture Capital Companies or Funds to invest in new companies in anticipation of future capital gains.
4873,1988-89,"However, such companies at present are not eligible for the concessional treatment of capital gains available to noncorporate entities."
4874,1988-89,"In order to overcome this problem, it has been decided to formulate a scheme under which approved Venture Capital Companies/Funds will be enabled to invest in new companies and be eligible for the concessional treatment of capital gains available to noncorporate entities."
4875,1988-89,Necessary legislative measures will be taken to bring this into effect.
4876,1988-89,"At present, a tax concession is available for investment in the equity shares of new industrial undertakings."
4877,1988-89,Small investors generally find it difficult to take advantage of these concessions because of absence of sufficient information about the prospects of new companies.
4878,1988-89,It has been decided that concession now available for direct investment in equity shares of new industrial undertakings will also be available for investment in special units of mutual funds where the resources are earmarked for investment in new projects.
4879,1988-89,This will help new companies to raise capital more easily.
4880,1988-89,I also propose to provide a seperate exemption upto
4881,1988-89,"Rs 3,000 for income from dividends under Section 80L of the Income tax Act."
4882,1988-89,"This will be in addition to the existing concessions available for certain types of incomes, including dividends upto Rs 7,000 and a further Rs 3,000 for income from investments in Unit Trust of India and certain other specified investments which I am including in the Finance Bill."
4883,1988-89,Sharp fluctuations in international exchange rates have posed problems for exporters as well as for Indian industry.
4884,1988-89,"In order to provide some protection to 10 individual projects from exchange rate fluctuations, financial institutions will introduce a new scheme whereby promoters of such projects can have their foreign currency loans designated in rupees."
4885,1988-89,The interest rate on such loans will be variable and will include an exchange premium.
4886,1988-89,The details of the scheme will be announced by the Industrial Development Bank of India separately.
4887,1988-89,It has been the policy of this Government to encourage workers’ participation in management in industry.
4888,1988-89,"It is only through interaction and involvement of workers in management that we can improve the overall performance, increase productivity, and prevent sickness."
4889,1988-89,Government has already announced a scheme to facilitate such participation.
4890,1988-89,I am happy to inform the House that complete exemption from Income tax will be given in respect of all expenditure incurred by companies in connection with introducing schemes for workers’ participation.
4891,1988-89,Government has also introduced a scheme whereby 5 per cent of the capital issues are reserved for employees.
4892,1988-89,"In order to facilitate purchase of shares by workers in their own companies, banks are being asked to provide loans liberally for this purpose."
4893,1988-89,Reserve Bank of India will be issuing necessary instructions shortly.
4894,1988-89,"Working journalists have contributed a lot to the country by their intellectual toil, and suggestions have been received that a Bill should be considered by the Parliament to provide a reasonable pension scheme for them."
4895,1988-89,Government will be taking appropriate steps in this direction after consulting all concerned.
4896,1988-89,Government attaches considerable importance to strengthening economic and cultural ties with Indian nationals settled abroad.
4897,1988-89,"A number of facilities, including fiscal concessions, have been extended to NonResident Indians for facilitating investments."
4898,1988-89,"In response to representations received, Government have now decided to introduce a new scheme of Foreign Currency denominated Bonds/Deposit Certificates for NonResident Indians on a nonrepatriable basis."
4899,1988-89,The maturity period of these Bonds/Deposit Certificates will be 7 years and these will carry an interest rate higher than that applicable to the repatriable foreign currency nonResident deposits.
4900,1988-89,"These Bonds/Deposits will be free from Income tax, Wealth tax and Gift tax."
4901,1988-89,The fiscal regime for investments and deposits by NonResident Indians in our country has been made quite liberal.
4902,1988-89,It is the Government’s intention to maintain fiscal stability.
4903,1988-89,No changes willl be made in the tax treatment which might adversely affect investments already made by NonResident Indians.
4904,1988-89,"The success of NonResident Indians in many fields of scientific, economic and cultural endeavour has been a matter of great satisfaction to us."
4905,1988-89,We cherish our continued association with them.
4906,1988-89,I also propose to introduce certain measures for boosting small savings collections.
4907,1988-89,I am particularly keen to mobilise untapped rural savings.
4908,1988-89,"A new scheme without tax concession, but with flexibility of encashment after two and half years of 11 deposit, is being introduced."
4909,1988-89,The rate of interest will progressively increase for longer durations.
4910,1988-89,The deposit will double in value after five and half years.
4911,1988-89,This instrument will attract new investments as it can be encashed as and when funds are needed.
4912,1988-89,The instrument will be called KISAN VIKAS PATRA.
4913,1988-89,"Last year a new savings scheme based on the net savings principle, was announced by the Prime Minister."
4914,1988-89,"Under this scheme, 50 per cent of deposits upto a maximum of Rs 20,000 are eligible for deduction under Section 80CCA of Income tax Act."
4915,1988-89,"However, in the year of withdrawal, 50 per cent of the amount withdrawn is added to the taxable income."
4916,1988-89,The interest rate on deposits was 9 per cent.
4917,1988-89,It has been decided to raise the interest rate to 11 per cent.
4918,1988-89,The new rate will be applicable to existing deposits also with effect from 1st April of last year.
4919,1988-89,"Further, the rate of deduction at the time of deposit will be raised from 50 per cent to 100 per cent with corresponding increase in the amount subject to tax at the time of withdrawal."
4920,1988-89,"The amount eligible for deposit is also being increased to Rs 30,000 per annum with effect from next financial year."
4921,1988-89,"The doubling period for Indira Vikas Patra sold from 1st March, 1988 will be reduced to five years."
4922,1988-89,"It is also proposed to continue the sale of Rahat Patra beyond 29th February, 1988."
4923,1988-89,"With the continuance of Rahat Patra, sale of Capital Investment Bonds is proposed to be discontinued from 1st April, 1988."
4924,1988-89,"Sir, I have taken this opportunity to announce certain measures for the welfare of the weaker and vulnerable sections of our society, for generating greater employment opportunities, particularly in the rural areas and for strengthening our productive base."
4925,1988-89,I am sure these measures will contribute to fulfilling the aspirations of our people.
4926,1988-89,Let me now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198788 and Budget Estimates for 198889.
4927,1988-89,The Revised Estimates of total expenditure in the Budget for 198788 are placed at Rs 66161 crores against Rs 62942 crores in the Budget Estimates.
4928,1988-89,"As the gravity of the drought became clear, the first task of the Government was to ensure that sufficient resources were available with State Governments in order to start relief works and take other measures for alleviating the distress caused by the drought."
4929,1988-89,Central Teams were despatched to States and decisions announced in record time in respect of ceilings of expenditure for States affected by drought and floods.
4930,1988-89,"Expenditure from the Central Budget on account of drought, floods and other natural calamities is now estimated at nearly Rs 2,000 crores."
4931,1988-89,"This includes Centre’s share of margin money, advance Plan assistance for drought, nonPlan assistance for floods and hailstorm, supply of subsidised foodgrains in drought affected areas, subsidised supply of seeds, 12 provision of rigs for drinking water and assistance for Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme."
4932,1988-89,There have been certain other inevitable increases in expenditure.
4933,1988-89,The subsidy on indigenous fertilizers will go up by Rs 300 crores.
4934,1988-89,Food subsidy will also be Rs 200 crores higher.
4935,1988-89,"I am sure Hon’ble Members will agree with me that, under the circumstances prevailing in the current year, the increases are fully justified."
4936,1988-89,"The liberalisation of pensionary benefits of Government employees, particularly the Defence Services personnel, is expected to add Rs 374 crores to the pension bill in the current year."
4937,1988-89,"Financial relief granted to certain public sector enterprises are expected to cost additional Rs 417 crores by way of subsidy, write off of loans etc."

4939,1988-89,"Taking into account the other variations, the total nonPlan expenditure during the current year is estimated to be Rs 1,971 crores higher than the original Budget provision of Rs 39,265 crores."
4940,1988-89,"Central assistance for State and U.T.Plans is expected to be Rs 1,127 crores higher mainly due to larger advance Plan assistance to States affected by drought."
4941,1988-89,"Budgetary support for Central Plan is estimated to be Rs 121 crores higher  this being the net effect of increases in sectors like agriculture, rural development, fertilizers, agricultural financial institutions, subsidy for setting up industries in backward areas, etc. offset by savings in certain other sectors."
4942,1988-89,"Taking the Plan and nonPlan together, there is an increase of Rs 3,219 crores."
4943,1988-89,"As a result of a series of measures undertaken by Government during the year, economy consciousness has been created and expenditure contained particularly in low priority areas."
4944,1988-89,"Gross Tax Revenue is estimated to yield Rs  1,028 crores more than the Budget Estimates mainly under Income and Corporation taxes and Customs duties."
4945,1988-89,The share of States in taxes will be higher by Rs 392 crores.
4946,1988-89,"Nontax Receipts will be higher by Rs 2,201 crores."
4947,1988-89,"Of this, nontax revenue receipts are expected to fetch Rs 765 crores more and capital receipts Rs 1,436 crores more."
4948,1988-89,Rs 700 crores of the increase in capital receipts will be from market loans.
4949,1988-89,"Taking the variations in expenditure and receipts into account, the current year is expected to end with an overall deficit of Rs 6080 crores."
4950,1988-89,"Notwithstanding the severe strain the events of the year have cast on the Budget, this is close to the original estimate of Rs 5,688 crores."
4951,1988-89,Budget Estimates for 198889 67.
4952,1988-89,The Hon’ble Members will agree that Budget Estimates for the year 1988 89 are being presented in a rather difficult environment.
4953,1988-89,"We have to ensure that, despite pressures on the Budget, there is no cutback in public investments, as that would have an adverse effect on economic activity and employment."
4954,1988-89,"Accordingly, in 13 framing the Budget for next year, highest priority has been given to maintaining the tempo of Plan investment."
4955,1988-89,"The Central Plan for 198889 has been fixed at Rs 28,715 crores against the approved outlay of Rs 24,622 crores in the crurrent year, a step up of 16.6 per cent."

4960,1988-89,"The total Plan expenditure in the Budget for the next year is thus, Rs 25,714 crores compared to Rs 24,925 crores in the Revised Estimates for the current year."
4961,1988-89,"I am glad to inform the House that the total transfers from Centre to States in 198788, including their share in taxes, were Rs 24,870 crores."

4963,1988-89,Several States have represented that their liquidity position has been affected by the drought and have requested for some relaxation in the Ways and Means limits.
4964,1988-89,"The Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that Reserve Bank of India is raising from tomorrow the Ways and Means limits by 40 per cent over the limits prevailing prior to October, 1986."
4965,1988-89,"These were stepped up by 30 per cent and 20 per cent for different periods of the year in October,1986."
4966,1988-89,"As mentioned earlier, it has been decided to increase the outlays of the Departments of Agriculture and Cooperation and Water Resources by 40 per cent above the current year’s outlay."
4967,1988-89,I also propose to provide Rs 671 crores for fertilizer projects in 198889.
4968,1988-89,"During the current year, four new fertilizer plants, two each in public and private sectors, are likely to go into poduction."
4969,1988-89,"Fertilizer production is expected to attain a level of 7.1 million tonnes this year, an increase of nearly 40 per cent over the output at the commencement of the Seventh Plan."
4970,1988-89,"The major antipoverty programmes, namely, Integrated Rural Development Programme IRDP, National Rural Employment Programme NREP and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme RLEGP will continue to be the main instruments for generating employment and increasing the earning opportunities for those below the povertyline."
4971,1988-89,"Thus far, about 254 lakh families have been assisted with a total investment of Rs 8,413 crores under IRDP."
4972,1988-89,Forty per cent of these beneficiaries belong to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
4973,1988-89,"Under NREP and RLEGP, 7,006 lakh mandays were generated in 198687 which was substantially higher than the target of 5,115 lakh mandays."
4974,1988-89,The target is likely to be exceeded this year also.
4975,1988-89,These programmes have proved highly successful in generating employment in our rural areas.
4976,1988-89,Suggestions have been received for expansion of these programmes as well as for their reorganisation.
4977,1988-89,"The merger of some important programmes, like the National Rural Employment Programme, Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme, Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme and Desert Development Programme, and various other Anti Poverty Programmes has also been suggested so that available resources can be more effectively deployed to meet the twin objectives of employment and creation of assets to meet village needs."
4978,1988-89,There is also need to provide flexibility at the operational level.
4979,1988-89,"In the light of these suggestions, it is proposed to undertake a thorough review of the employment programmes in the coming year to examine the possibility of having a comprehensive programme."
4980,1988-89,Rural water supply continues to receive high priority.

4983,1988-89,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, the outlay on water supply is in addition to the Minimum Needs Programme outlay in the State Sector."
4984,1988-89,"Welfare programmes for the tribal people have to be based on respect and understanding of their culture and tradition, and appreciation of their social, psychological and economic problems."
4985,1988-89,The main instrument for the development of tribal people and tribal areas is the Tribal subPlan.
4986,1988-89,"As the Hon’ble Members know, the Tribal subPlans are financed by the State Governments, Special Central Assistance, Centrally Sponsored Programmes and financial institutions."

4991,1988-89,Our human resources are the most important resource of all.
4992,1988-89,The quality of manpower developed today will be decisive in determining the pace and direction of economic and social progress in the future.
4993,1988-89,"In 1986, a new Education Policy was introduced after extensive discussion in Parliament and outside."
4994,1988-89,"In order to give a good start to the new Policy, last year, while presenting the Budget, the Prime Minister raised the allocation for education sharply to Rs 800 crores from Rs 352 crores in 198687."
4995,1988-89,The actual expenditure is likely to be of the order of Rs 700 crores.
4996,1988-89,Next year’s Plan makes an allocation of Rs 800 crores.
4997,1988-89,"Together with the nonPlan provision, the total allocation for the Department of Education in 198889 will be Rs 1,550 crores against the Revised Estimate of Rs 1,185 crores for 198788."
4998,1988-89,Improvement in the health status of the population is an essential component of the human resource development.
4999,1988-89,"To achieve this, special emphasis is 15 being laid on establishing primary health facilities, particularly in rural areas, launching control programmes for major communicable and noncommunicable diseases, augmenting facilities for medical and paramedical education and training and providing family welfare, maternity and child health, immunization and related services."

5036,1988-89,Many other initiatives are envisaged in the different sectors of the economy.

5055,1988-89,I shall now turn to my revenue proposals.
5056,1988-89,"Every Budget has to raise some resources for financing expenditure, and I shall not be failing in my duty to do so."
5057,1988-89,"However, I do believe that it is equally, if not more, important to use fiscal policy for achieving our wider economic and social goals while, at the same time, providing relief where it is due."
5058,1988-89,"I am sure, the Hon’ble Members will find a strong link between the proposals that I am about to make, and some of the peopleoriented initiatives that I have referred to in Part A of my speech."
5059,1988-89,"This House is aware of the fact that in view of the exigencies of the situation, in order to meet the formidable aftereffects of the drought of 198788, Government took a decision to levy a surcharge of 5% on incometax for persons with taxable income above Rs 50,000, a surcharge of 10% on wealth tax for the assessment year 198889 and a 5% surcharge by way of auxiliary duty of customs on imported goods excluding essential commodities like fertilizers, power equipment, lifesaving drugs and medical equipment, etc."
5060,1988-89,This timely action helped the country and the Central and State Governments to meet the requirements of a very difficult situation created by the drought.
5061,1988-89,This surcharge did not touch essential commodities.
5062,1988-89,"In view of the continuing pernicious effects of the drought and the natural calamities, I propose to continue with these surcharges for one more year."
5063,1988-89,"In addition, it is now proposed to levy a surcharge by way of Special Excise Duty at the rate of 1/20th of the Basic Duty of Excise."
5064,1988-89,"The incidence of this surcharge will generally be small; for example, it will be only one quarter of one percent i.e. 0.25%, where the basic duty is 5% ad valorem and one percentage point where the basic duty is 20%."
5065,1988-89,Essential commodities and other priority items which are presently exempt from excise duty will continue to remain exempt.
5066,1988-89,"I am also exempting from this 18 surcharge, certain other essential goods of common consumption, namely, sugar, matches, cotton fabrics, vanaspati, refined vegetable oil, tea, coffee and kerosene."
5067,1988-89,"Hon’ble Members will recall that, in August, 1986, a Discussion Paper on Direct Tax Laws was presented in Parliament."
5068,1988-89,"After further discussions and consultations among experts and the public, the Government had introduced the Direct Tax Laws Amendment Bill, 1987, which was passed during the last Session."
5069,1988-89,"Since then, many representations have been received from experts, concerned Associations, Chambers of Commerce and other taxpayers regarding some provisions in the Act."
5070,1988-89,"The following, inter alia, are the main points made in these representations: 1"
5071,1988-89,"The proposed system of assessment of partnership firms is too harsh particularly on partnership firms with small income, as such firms, subject to certain deductions, will henceforth be taxed at the maximum marginal rate."
5072,1988-89,Certain other clarifications have also been sought in regard to some other provisions relating to taxation of firms.
5073,1988-89,The levy of additional tax at a flat rate of 30 per cent would be very unfair in cases of genuine doubt regarding taxability of certain receipts and that the levy of additional tax should itself be appealable.
5074,1988-89,"The provisions relating to charitable trusts, voluntary agencies and institutions carrying on scientific research, etc. may result in unintended hardship, particularly as regards the treatment of contributions to the corpus of such institutions."
5075,1988-89,The new Act provides for unfettered discretion regarding reopening of assessments merely on a change of opinion.
5076,1988-89,"There are many positive features in the Act, which will help the tax payers by simplifying the law, but there is also scope for reconsideration keeping in view the representations against some of its provisions."
5077,1988-89,"In a democracy, Government should always keep itself abreast of public opinion and be flexible enough to respond to reasonable suggestions."
5078,1988-89,Government will bring a further amendment bill in the Budget Session which will take care of genuine grievances.
5079,1988-89,"After the Bill is introduced, Government will be happy to consider any further suggestions that the Hon’ble Members may have to offer."
5080,1988-89,A reasonable degree of stability in the Direct Tax regime is desirable for inspiring confidence and encouraging savings and investment.
5081,1988-89,"I do not, therefore, propose any change in the rate structure for personal and corporate taxes."
5082,1988-89,"There is, however, a case for reducing, to some extent, the brunt of the burden borne by the fixed income groups."
5083,1988-89,"I, therefore, propose to raise the rate of standard deduction from 30 per cent to 331/3rd per cent of salary income and the 19 ceiling from Rs 10,000/ to Rs 12,000/."
5084,1988-89,This measure will benefit about a million taxpayers.
5085,1988-89,"Hon’ble Members will recall that Estate Duty was abolished from March, 1985."
5086,1988-89,"This was done mainly because the Estate Duty law was complicated and led to procedural harassment to large numbers of taxpayers at a time of great distress, with negligible gain in terms of revenue."
5087,1988-89,"However, there is a strong case on grounds of social justice for taxing the transfer of wealth through inheritance especially where the volume of wealth involved is large."
5088,1988-89,This matter has been under consideration of Government for some time.
5089,1988-89,Government have decided to levy a tax on the transfer of wealth which will be applicable to all wealthtax assessees.
5090,1988-89,The tax will be levied in respect of assets subject to wealth tax.
5091,1988-89,The method for valuation of assets would be the same as for the wealth tax.
5092,1988-89,It will also be administered by the wealth tax officer.
5093,1988-89,The rate of the wealth transfer tax would be 5 times the applicable wealth tax rates.
5094,1988-89,This new tax will avoid the rigidities and procedural delays which characterised the operation of the old Estate Duty Act.
5095,1988-89,"As I have mentioned, it will be applicable only to wealth tax assessees and will not affect ordinary taxpayers."
5096,1988-89,Separate legislation in this regard will be introduced in this Session.
5097,1988-89,"The thrust of my other proposals in regard to Direct Taxes is to strengthen incentives for export promotion and foreign exchange earnings, to encourage savings and to stimulate the capital market."
5098,1988-89,"To encourage exports, I propose to enhance the existing tax concession under Section 80 HHC for export profits so as to exempt 100 per cent of export profits from incometax."
5099,1988-89,It is also proposed to extend the benefit to supporting manufacturers exporting through Trading or Export Houses.
5100,1988-89,A fiveyear tax holiday presently available for units in Free Trade Zones is also being extended to 100 per cent Export Oriented Units.
5101,1988-89,"Replantation and rejuvenation subsidies for rubber, coffee and cardamom plantations are also proposed to be exempted from incometax."
5102,1988-89,"To promote longterm financing available for construction and purchase of houses, I propose to enhance the existing concession available under Section 80L in respect of interest and dividend income received from companies providing such finance."
5103,1988-89,"At present, such income is included under the general exemption limit of Rs 7,000."
5104,1988-89,"It is proposed to make such income also eligible under the separate limit of Rs 3,000 for UTI under Section 80L. 101."
5105,1988-89,"As an antievasion measure, I propose to provide for assessment of income of persons engaged in certain trades, like liquor and forest contracts, at a reasonably fixed percentage of the amount payable by them while purchasing the goods."
5106,1988-89,The tax will be collected at source.
5107,1988-89,"I also propose to tax under the head “capital gains”, income from transfer of a capital asset by a holding company to its whollyowned subsidiary company or 20 vice versa, in every case where the capital asset is taken over as stockintrade at the time of transfer."
5108,1988-89,"Hon’ble Members will recall that in Part A of my speech, I have already referred to certain changes being made in the incometax payable by LIC as well as certain fiscal measures to promote the equity market."
5109,1988-89,There are certain other minor proposals regarding Direct Taxes in the Finance Bill.
5110,1988-89,"The total effect of these proposals will be a revenue loss of Rs 201 crores, which will be offset by my proposal to continue with the levy of surcharge on income tax and wealthtax which will mean a gain of Rs 270 crores."
5111,1988-89,"Thus, the net increase in revenue will be Rs 69 crores."
5112,1988-89,"Sir, I will now move on to the proposals relating to indirect taxes."
5113,1988-89,It has been my endeavour to see that the basic thrust provided in the field of indirect taxes in the Budget last year is carried forward.
5114,1988-89,"I have proposals for providing stimuli to cover agriculture and farming sectors, rural employment, exports, health and medical care, housing and construction activities, technology upgradation and selected industries such as cement, textiles, electronics, paper and plastics."

5118,1988-89,I now propose a number of fiscal reliefs for promotion of agriculture and agrobased activities.
5119,1988-89,Monobloc pumpsets and submersible pumpsets are important for irrigation.
5120,1988-89,I am exempting electric motors used in these pumpsets from excise duty.
5121,1988-89,"To bring down the cost for farmers, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty a large number of pesticide intermediates."
5122,1988-89,I am also proposing to reduce customs duty in respect of a number of pesticides and pesticide intermediates from the existing levels of 105 per cent and 147 per cent to 70 per cent and 60 per cent ad valorem.
5123,1988-89,These measures will reduce the cost of indigenous production and the endprices.
5124,1988-89,"With a view to promoting modernisation in the agricultural, horticultural, poultry and beekeeping sectors, I am providing for full exemption from excise duty in respect of machinery for these sectors such as sprinkler systems, fodder mixers, germination appliances, egg candlers, etc. 110."
5125,1988-89,Cold storages are of great importance for the marketing of agricultural produce.

5129,1988-89,Food Processing and Packaging 112.
5130,1988-89,Growth of food processing and packaging industry can be of immense help in increasing the valueadded of agricultural produce and raising incomes of farmers.
5131,1988-89,"In continuation of certain measures for growth of this industry, announced by the Prime Minister last year, it is proposed to further reduce the customs duty in respect of 34 specified items of food processing and packaging machinery from 55 per cent to 35 per cent ad valorem."
5132,1988-89,"I also propose to reduce the excise duty on preparations from vegetables, fruits, nuts or other parts of plants like jams, fruit juices, etc. from 10 per cent to 5 per cent ad valorem."
5133,1988-89,"Such preparations from vegetables and fruits like jams, jellies, fruit juices, sauces, ketchups and pickles, if manufactured in rural areas by registered cooperative societies, Khadi & Village Industries Commission and State Khadi & Village Industries Boards are proposed to be exempted from excise duty altogether."
5134,1988-89,I also propose to reduce the excise duty on aluminium foil from 25 per cent to 15 per cent ad valorem.

5144,1988-89,I am conscious of the fact that common consumers have been affected by some price increase.

5350,1988-89,"I also seek the active cooperation of the State Governments, as it is with their assistance that we can succeed in this task."
5351,1988-89,"I hope and trust that the State Governments will also mount active steps against hoarding, blackmarketing, smuggling and sale of smuggled goods."

5359,1988-89,"Government reiterates its determination to closely monitor expenditure, maximise collection of revenues and contain the budgetary deficit."
5360,1988-89,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in framing the Budget proposals, my guiding principle has been the need to boost agriculture, help the poor and generate more employment, investment and growth."
5361,1988-89,India’s achievements since Independence are the result of the untiring efforts of all our people.
5362,1988-89,Every section of our people has contributed to build the country’s economy.
5363,1988-89,No single section or region or group can claim exclusive credit for it.
5364,1988-89,The nation’s Parliament as the supreme forum of our democracy has also made an invaluable contribution.
5365,1988-89,"In all humility, may I take this opportunity to request through you, Sir, all the Hon’ble Members of Parliament, to make this year’s debate on the budget a participatory and constructive endeavour to evolve a nationally accepted strategy to achieve our goals."
5366,1988-89,"Let us be proud of what all of us together have been able to do and if there are inadequacies or deficiencies, let us overcome them collectively."
5367,1988-89,Let us all join in the exciting task of India’s economic development and do so by making it a common fraternal partnership of the entire Indian people.
5368,1988-89,As our Prime Minister Shri Rajiv Gandhi said a couple of months ago: “Our socialism is our own.
5369,1988-89,It is not a foreign transplant.
5370,1988-89,It is not cast in someone else’s ideological mould.
5371,1988-89,"It is rooted in our own history, our culture, our realities."
5372,1988-89,"Gandhiji enjoined us to work for the Daridra Narayan, to wipe every tear from every eye."
5373,1988-89,This constitutes the moral imperative of our socialism.”
5374,1988-89,This is also the message that this Budget seeks to convey.
5375,1988-89,"Sir, I now commend this budget to the House."
5376,1989-90,I rise to present the Budget for the year 198990.
5377,1989-90,"The Budget is an instrument for achieving the basic objectives of planned development which, broadly, are growth, modernisation, selfreliance and social justice."
5378,1989-90,"In each of these areas, we have made substantial progress."
5379,1989-90,There are clear signs of an acceleration in the growth rate of our economy during the eighties.
5380,1989-90,"The pace of modernisation, particularly in industry and infrastructure has increased greatly because of the policies pursued by us for the past few years."
5381,1989-90,The movement towards selfreliance has been maintained by the sustained growth in exports.
5382,1989-90,"And most important of all, our commitment to the goals of social justice has been demonstrated in the major initiatives that we have taken in antipoverty and employment programmes and in the fulfilment of essential needs."
5383,1989-90,These longterm objectives provide the framework within which the Budget for 198990 has been formulated.
5384,1989-90,The Annual Budget has to pursue these longterm objectives within the context of the shortterm economic situation.
5385,1989-90,"The Economic Survey for the year 198889, which was laid on the Table of the House a few days ago, deals with the economic situation in some detail."
5386,1989-90,I will only highlight a few key points.
5387,1989-90,The performance of the Indian economy in the past few years has shown unmistakable features of strength.
5388,1989-90,The first is the resilience of the economy when confronted with the severe disruption caused by drought and floods.
5389,1989-90,"Last year, my predecessor, when presenting the Budget, had referred to this and indicated that the gross domestic product would grow perhaps by 1 to 2 per cent."
5390,1989-90,"I am happy to inform the House that the latest estimates of economic performance in the drought year of 198788 indicate that, despite the drought, GDP grew by 3.6 per cent."
5391,1989-90,This commendable performance in a year of drought has been followed by vigorous growth in the current year and we expect the GDP to grow by 9 per cent or more in real terms.
5392,1989-90,"Both the rate of growth of GDP in the drought year and the pace of recovery in the postdrought year, are significantly higher than those in earlier periods of drought."
5393,1989-90,I may add that the average growth rate of GDP in the first four years of the Plan will exceed the Plan target of 5 per cent.
5394,1989-90,The performance in the agricultural sector in these past two years gives grounds for hope.
5395,1989-90,"Last year, despite the severe drought and floods, foodgrains production was 138 million tonnes, only marginally lower than in the previous year, showing that our policies to contain the impact of the drought were successful."
5396,1989-90,"This 1 year, foodgrains production is expected to exceed the target of 166 million tonnes."
5397,1989-90,"Oilseeds, cotton and sugar production are expected to reach record levels."
5398,1989-90,The sector continues to demonstrate a high potential for growth.
5399,1989-90,"The growth in output in a period of stress, the careful management of the food economy by the Government, and the special measures taken to boost agricultural production and provide relief to those affected by drought have ensured that inflation, as measured by the Wholesale Price Index, was limited to 10.6 per cent in 198788."
5400,1989-90,"The rate of inflation in the current year has been under 5 per cent up to the end of January, 1989 Government is concerned about the pressure on prices, but it is a matter of some satisfaction that this pressure has been generally lower than in previous droughts."
5401,1989-90,Government remains fully vigilant on this crucial front and are determined to ensure effective containment of inflation.
5402,1989-90,"The second encouraging feature of economic performance in recent years, is the sustained growth of industrial sector and improved performance in the field of infrastructure."
5403,1989-90,"For 4 years in succession, manufacturing output has grown by over 8 per cent per year which is a clear vindication of the industrial policy of the Government."
5404,1989-90,There is a spirit of optimism in industry which is reflected in the generally good corporate performance and buoyant conditions in the capital market.
5405,1989-90,Electricity generation has increased steadily and the plant load factor of thermal plants has gone up from 50.1 per cent in 199485 to 56.5 per cent in 198788.
5406,1989-90,Targets for capacity creation in the power sector set for the Seventh Plan are expected to be achieved.
5407,1989-90,In the Railways the quantity of freight carried has increased in the first three years of the Seventh Plan by an amount as large as the total increase over the previous 10 years.
5408,1989-90,"More important, there has been a steady improvement in productivity over these years."
5409,1989-90,A particularly welcome feature is the improvement in the performance of the basic materials industries.
5410,1989-90,"In the first nine months of this year, production of saleable steel by the integrated steel plants rose by 10.1 per cent, of cement by 12 per cent, nitrogenous fertilisers by 26.2 per cent and phosphatic fertilisers by 64.5 per cent when compared with the corresponding period last year."
5411,1989-90,The performance of Central Public Sector Enterprises has shown improvement.
5412,1989-90,In the first six months of this year the provisional results of 179 operating enterprises show that their net profit rose to Rs 694.19 crores from Rs 59.79 crores in the corresponding period of 198788.
5413,1989-90,We are committed to a policy of supporting the growth of our public sector.
5414,1989-90,"However, we recognise that some changes are required to ensure a higher level of performance, particularly with regard to resource generation."
5415,1989-90,"With a view to granting greater autonomy to public sector enterprises consistent with their accountability, the Government has been signing Memoranda of Understanding with some of the Public Sector Undertakings."
5416,1989-90,"The MOU indicates the responsibilities of the enterprise in fulfilling certain physical, financial and social objectives including 2 resource generation, and of the Government, in turn, for supporting the enterprise in fulfilling various objectives and targets set for the enterprise."
5417,1989-90,Eleven Public Sector Undertakings signed MOUs with the Government for the year 198889.
5418,1989-90,Seven more Public Sector Undertakings will sign MOUs for the year 198990.
5419,1989-90,The Government has constituted a High Level Committee under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to evaluate the performance of MOU signing companies and their administrative Ministries in fulfilling their obligations under die MOU.
5420,1989-90,I have referred to the resilience of the economy and the improved growth performance in industry and infrastructure because these are the strengths that will allow us to pursue even more vigorously our basic objectives of raising the living standards of the poor and strengthening the economic independence of our country.
5421,1989-90,But I would be failing in my duty if I do not also draw the attention of the House to certain problem areas.
5422,1989-90,One area that needs more attention is the stimulation of savings and the containment of the budget deficit.
5423,1989-90,"We have always prided ourselves on being a nation with a high savings rate, and our culture has always emphasised the virtues of simple living and frugality."
5424,1989-90,Budgetary policy must reinforce these virtues of thrift both through positive incentives to stimulate savings and through measures to restrain luxury consumption.
5425,1989-90,I will indicate later in the speech the specific measures that we propose to take towards this end.
5426,1989-90,"Equally important, and in some sense more significant, is the prudent management of public expenditure: Sometimes, it is assumed that Government expenditure, as commonly understood, is all on the wages and salaries of Government servants and on goods and services purchased by the Government Departments to fulfil their functions."
5427,1989-90,This is far from being the case.
5428,1989-90,In actual fact the direct consumption expenditure of the Central Government on defence and Government Administration is less than one quarter of the total expenditure.
5429,1989-90,A little under one tenth of the Budget is for the direct capital expenditure of the Central Government.
5430,1989-90,"As much as twothirds of the Budget expenditure really take the form of financial transfers to other spending entities by Way of interest, subsidies, grants, loans, etc."
5431,1989-90,"In fact, a significant part of what is shown as expenditure in the Budget is only the financial intermediation of funds shown as a capital receipt on the one side and as expenditure in the form of loans or equity investment on the other."
5432,1989-90,I am drawing attention to the structure of the expenditure side of the Central Budget in order to emphasise that the exercise of due prudence is not merely a matter of economy instructions regarding staff or travel or purchases.
5433,1989-90,"But it is as important, in fact even more important, to consider other items of expenditure like subsidies, grants and loans, many of which are embedded in specific schemes and programmes."
5434,1989-90,"We must ask ourselves whether we are getting value for money from these subsidies, schemes and programmes."
5435,1989-90,"In many cases the desired 3 result could be achieved at a lesser cost by better targetting, consolidation of multiple programmes, greater decentralisation linked to mobilisation of local resources."
5436,1989-90,We will ensure that such an evaluation forms the basis for the schemes/programmes that will form part of the Eighth Plan.
5437,1989-90,The balance of payments is another area of concern.
5438,1989-90,A certain amount of pressure on external payments is unavoidable in a situation where we have urgent needs for investment and modernisation which inevitably require expansion of imports.
5439,1989-90,It is for this reason that Government have attached high priority to expanding exports to pay for the imports the economy needs.
5440,1989-90,Our policies in this regard have been successful and in the past two years our exports have increased quite rapidlyover 25 per cent in 198788 and 24 to 25 per cent in the first nine months of the current financial year.
5441,1989-90,"But at the same time, the import bill has also increased sharply, especially so in the first half of this year."
5442,1989-90,"This surge in the import bill is partly due to the foodgrains and edible oil imports necessitated by last year’s drought and partly to the. sharp increase in the international prices of metals, chemicals and edible oils."
5443,1989-90,"Apart from this, our debt repayment liabilities were relatively high."
5444,1989-90,"The limited availability of concessional finance has compelled us to increase the share of commercial borrowings, but we have tried to keep these within limits that are manageable."
5445,1989-90,We do not envisage any difficulty in servicing our external debt.
5446,1989-90,The Indian economy has a great deal of underlying strength.
5447,1989-90,The sustained growth of industrial sector and the investments made in modernisation and upgradation will show results in terms of higher exports.
5448,1989-90,Ibis in fact is the real answer to the balance of payments problem.
5449,1989-90,I have every hope that the momentum of export growth will be sustained and enhanced.
5450,1989-90,"If necessary, we must be prepared to restrain domestic consumption to some extent in certain areas in order to release supplies for export."
5451,1989-90,We have resisted the temptation to cope with the shortterm difficulties in our balance of payments by ad hoc import regulation through detailed import licensing.
5452,1989-90,"Such a process would be selfdefeating as it will disrupt the economy, inhibit exports and weaken our attempts at modernisation."
5453,1989-90,The composition of our imports has changed greatly during the eighties.
5454,1989-90,"In 198081, 65 per cent of our imports consisted of a few bulk commodities like foodgrains, edible oils, fertilizers, petroleum and metals where direct import regulation through foreign exchange allocations is relatively easy."
5455,1989-90,"In 198788, these bulk commodities accounted for only 33 per cent of our imports."
5456,1989-90,"The other imports cover a vast range of raw materials, capital goods, chemicals and industrial components."
5457,1989-90,Direct regulation of these through foreign exchange allocations is difficult and could well lead to delays and inefficiency.
5458,1989-90,"Hence, the nonbulk import bill has to be managed through more effective use of indirect instruments."
5459,1989-90,Later in this speech I will put before you some measures to discourage low priority imports which go towards the consumption of upper income groups.
5460,1989-90,Kit culture based consumerism is not the objective of our industrial and trade policy and must be discouraged.
5461,1989-90,Industrial policy has an important role to play in stimulating production which can substitute efficiently for imports.
5462,1989-90,Towards this end the Government will ensure that domestic production of items which are imported in substantial quantity is maximised and will reexamine and remove any restrictions which stand in the way.
5463,1989-90,Let me now turn to the special thrust areas in this Budget.
5464,1989-90,"Successive budgets have sought to tackle the basic problems of poverty and unemployment directly, a process which has been greatly accelerated since 1980 81."
5465,1989-90,"In that year, actual expenditure on rural development, social services and food and cloth subsidies amounted to Rs 1,971 crores in the Central Budget."
5466,1989-90,"The greater part of the expenditure in these areas is for directly targeted programmes to improve employment and the earning capacity of the poor and of vulnerable groups like scheduled castes and tribes, and weaker sections, provide them with basic services like education, healthcare and water supply, and subsidise some items of essential consumption."
5467,1989-90,"In 198889 the Budget Estimates provided Rs 8,652 crores for the same activities."
5468,1989-90,"I have not included in this total the expenditure on agriculture and the fertilizer subsidy which has increased from an actual expenditure of Rs 1,179 crores in 198081 to a Budget provision of Rs 4,343 crores in 198889."
5469,1989-90,Under the Integrated Rural Development Programme IRDP over 25 million families below the poverty line have been assisted to take up income generating activities.
5470,1989-90,"The total investment under this Programme since the beginning of the Sixth Plan has been over Rs  Ten thousand crores, including the term credit provided by the financial institutions."
5471,1989-90,"I am happy to inform the Hon’ble Members that under the twin programmes of employment generation for the rural poor, viz., National Rural Employment Programme NREP and Rural Landless Employment Guarantee Programme RLEOP, 67 crore mandays of employment were generated during 198788 as against the target of 50 crore mandays."
5472,1989-90,The present strategy of direct attack on rural poverty through the existing major programmes of selfemployment and wageemployment will be continued and made more cost effective.
5473,1989-90,Employment is the most urgent need of our people.
5474,1989-90,Much of the employment growth will come from growth in agriculture and in labourintensive agroprocessing industries and services.
5475,1989-90,"However, a direct attack on the problem of unemployment is essential."
5476,1989-90,"We, therefore, propose to give a special thrust to all programmes of employment generation."
5477,1989-90,"It is proposed to merge NREP/RLEGP into a single programme, and to decentralise its implementation."
5478,1989-90,This merged programme will operate throughout the country and will be funded 75 per cent by the Centre.
5479,1989-90,Poverty and unemployment are intense in certain disadvantaged regions and existing employment programmes fall short of needs.
5480,1989-90,"Hence, in addition to the reorganised national programme it is proposed to launch a new intensive rural employment programme which will provide additional funds to selected 120 districts which are backward and suffer from acute unemployment."
5481,1989-90,"In this year when we are celebrating the birth centenary of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the architect of modern India, there is perhaps no better way of remembering him than to intensify our efforts to remove poverty and unemployment."
5482,1989-90,This programme is a further major step in that direction.
5483,1989-90,It will be named after Panditji to reflect the deepest aspiration of our people.
5484,1989-90,This new programme will allow fuller employment opportunities to at least one member of each family living below the poverty line.
5485,1989-90,The funds for this scheme will be in addition to the provision available to the district under the NREP and RLEGP Programmes.
5486,1989-90,These funds will be merged and locally useful schemes will be taken up to maximise employment opportunities and the creation of productive assets.
5487,1989-90,We hope that the enhancement of the provision for employment through this new scheme will ensure substantial improvement in living standards of the poor and an increase in the productive and socially useful assets in these areas.
5488,1989-90,The details of the programme will be announced later.
5489,1989-90,The provision for this new programme will be Rs 500 crores in 198990.
5490,1989-90,"Including this, the provision for employment programmes will be Rs 1.711 crores in 198990."
5491,1989-90,I propose to cover the cost of the new programme basically by mobilising additional resources from those who already have substantial incomes and the benefit of gainful employment.
5492,1989-90,I will revert to this later in my speech.
5493,1989-90,We welcome further efforts in this direction by State Governments.
5494,1989-90,"Recently, the Constitution has been amended to raise the upper limit for the profession tax to Rs 2,500."
5495,1989-90,We urge State Governments to use this enabling provision to mobilise additional resources for expanding employment.
5496,1989-90,Additional employment will help poor households to raise their standard of living.
5497,1989-90,But in addition a more direct effort at improving the condition of women and children is necessary.
5498,1989-90,I therefore propose a new programme for the free distribution of saris to destitute women.
5499,1989-90,As for children the ongoing Integrated Child Development Services Programme will be greatly expanded to cover 500 more blocks in addition to over 1700 already covered.
5500,1989-90,"This programme is aimed at raising the health, nutrition and educational status of poor children."
5501,1989-90,"The total outlay for rural development, social services and on food and cloth subsidies will be Rs 9374 crores in this Budget."
5502,1989-90,The implementation of antipoverty and social services programmes takes place largely through State Plans.
5503,1989-90,Many of these programmes are externally assisted.
5504,1989-90,"It is proposed to modify these arrangements to enhance the additional central assistance made available to the States to 100 per cent for assistance received under externally aided projects in the social services sector, and for programmes which have a direct bearing on poverty alleviation."
5505,1989-90,"This decision will make available substantially more resources to the States than under the present arrangements, and will facilitate additional investments by them in these vital sectors."
5506,1989-90,"Sectors which are expected to benefit from this decision are Agriculture, Rural Development, Irrigation, Environment, Health, Family welfare, Nutrition, Women’s Development, Education, Housing, Water Supply and Urban Development."
5507,1989-90,Agriculture is the mainstay of our population and a priority sector in our Plans.
5508,1989-90,Today the incidence of taxes on agricultural outputs and inputs is minimal and in fact substantial subsidies are provided both in the Central and State Budgets.
5509,1989-90,"As I mentioned earlier, Plan and nonPlan expenditure on agriculture and the fertilizer subsidy has gone up sharply since 198081."
5510,1989-90,This year also provision is being stepped up and will reach a level of Rs 5173 crores.
5511,1989-90,Credit is a major input for agricultural production.
5512,1989-90,"In order to increase the flow of credit to agriculture, the target for direct finance to agriculture by Public Sector banks, which was raised last year from 16 per cent to 17 per cent of their total outstanding advances is being further raised to 18 per cent to be achieved by the end of 198990."
5513,1989-90,"With this change the total credit to be made available to agriculture by commercial banks, Regional Rural Banks and Cooperative banks will increase by over Rs 4,000 crores in 198990."
5514,1989-90,"Hon’ble Member; are aware that the rate of interest on crop loans upto Rs 15,000 was reduced last year and the reduction varied between 1 1/2 per cent and 2 1/2 per cent."
5515,1989-90,"With a view to extending the scope of relief, the Reserve Bank of India is today issuing instructions reducing the rate of interest charged on crop loans between Rs 15,000 and Rs 25,000 to 12 per cent from the existing maximum rate of 14 per cent."
5516,1989-90,One area of concern is the pace of implementation of irrigation projects in the States.
5517,1989-90,"In addition, the gap between the potential created and utilisation of irrigation, leaves much to be desired."
5518,1989-90,The decision to provide higher additionality for external assistance for agriculture and irrigation which I have referred to earlier will add to the funds available for these purposes in State Plans.
5519,1989-90,My hope is that this will help in ensuring better utilisation of aid funds and quicker completion of projects.
5520,1989-90,"The rapid growth in incomes in our rural economy will require not merely higher production but also diversification of crops, better postharvest technology, processing of agricultural products into higher value products, etc. 7 37."
5521,1989-90,"The new Ministry of Food Processing Industries, the first of its kind in the developing countries, was established in July, 1988 to provide for a dynamic relationship between the farmer and industry so that there is better utilisation of agricultural products, greater addition of value to rural produce, generation of massive employment in rural areas, enhancement of the net level of rural incomes and induction /Of modem technology in the processing of food."
5522,1989-90,"Another objective of the Ministry is to promote utilisation of the large scale wastages which take place in the pre and post harvest handling of fruits and vegetables, thereby improving the economic utilisation of food produced as well as enhancing the nutritional inputs available to the people."
5523,1989-90,Later in my speech I will indicate some fiscal incentives to provide a greater stimulus to these industries.
5524,1989-90,The Government attaches very high priority to housing.
5525,1989-90,It is an activity that meets a very essential need and that is capable of generating a very substantial volume of employment.
5526,1989-90,"In pursuance of this, the Government has formulated a comprehensive National Housing Policy."
5527,1989-90,In the field of housing finance several new initiatives were taken in 198889.
5528,1989-90,The Reserve Bank of India has liberalised the terms and conditions of housing loans.
5529,1989-90,The Life Insurance Corporation has launched a new scheme known as Bima Niwas Yojana which will enable policy holders to receive financial assistance for purchase or construction of flats.
5530,1989-90,The National Housing Bank has been established and has now become operational.
5531,1989-90,Promotion of a healthy housing finance system and providing adequate finance to the housing sector are the principal functions of the Bank.
5532,1989-90,"In formulating its financing policies, the Bank will adopt the motto of the small man first."
5533,1989-90,It has accordingly announced its refinance scheme in respect of loans given for low income housing of upto 40 square metres.
5534,1989-90,"Similarly, in land development and housing projects financed by it, the Bank will ensure that not less than 75 per cent of the plots to be thus developed or houses to be built, will be for those seeking builtup accommodation upto 40 square metres."
5535,1989-90,The prospect of owning a house is a major incentive for saving.
5536,1989-90,"We have, therefore, decided to establish a new scheme called the Home Loan Account Scheme which will be launched by the National Housing Bank in cooperation with scheduled banks."
5537,1989-90,"To facilitate participation by all segments of the community especially in rural areas, the minimum contribution to the saving scheme is fixed at Rs 30 per month or Rs 360 per annum."
5538,1989-90,The savings will earn interest at 10 per cent per annum.
5539,1989-90,"After saving for a minimum period of five years, a member will be eligible for a loan equal in amount to a multiple of the accumulated savings including interest Specific efforts will be made to link up the Home Loan Account Scheme with the registration for land or house allotment by public agencies."
5540,1989-90,I will propose certain tax concessions for these savings.
5541,1989-90,Let me now turn to the industrial sector.
5542,1989-90,I have referred to the good performance of the industry and infrastructure sector.
5543,1989-90,"We believe that the changes with regard to industrial licensing, price and distribution controls and trade policy that we have made over the past few years have paid rich dividends."
5544,1989-90,"The underlying theme of these policy changes is to promote both growth and efficiency by stimulating domestic competition, technology acquisition and modernisation."
5545,1989-90,Our industrial structure is now very complex.
5546,1989-90,Many segments have reached a certain degree of maturity.
5547,1989-90,In this situation it is possible for us to relax many of our detailed regulations and yet remain in control over the direction of development through a judicious use of fiscal and credit policies.
5548,1989-90,"In furtherance of this approach, the Government has decided to decontrol the pricing and distribution of cement and aluminium with immediate effect."
5549,1989-90,"Since the partial decontrol of cement from 28th February, 1982, the cement industry has witnessed an impressive growth."
5550,1989-90,The production of cement which was 21.01 million tonnes in 198182 is slated to increase to 43.5 million tonnes in 1988 89 and 49 million tonnes in 198990.
5551,1989-90,"Over this period, the levy obligation has been progressively decreased and a fair price for the levy cement has been given."
5552,1989-90,These policies have led to the stoppage of imports since 1985.
5553,1989-90,In fact the country is now in a position to export cement.
5554,1989-90,Our long term strategy is to increase the production to 65 million tonnes by the end of the Eighth Plan and 87 million tonnes by the end of the Ninth Plan.
5555,1989-90,"At present, the levy obligation works out to less than 20 per cent of the total output of the industry."
5556,1989-90,"It has now been decided that all price and distribution controls on the cement industry be removed with effect from 1st March, 1989."
5557,1989-90,"To ensure the availability of cement at reasonable prices in the remote and hilly regions of the country, a suitable subsidy scheme is being worked out."
5558,1989-90,"With the progressive commissioning of the National Aluminium Company NALCO, India has made great strides in the production of aluminium metal."
5559,1989-90,"After achieving a record production of 278,000 tonnes in 198788, production in 198889 is estimated to go up by 30 per cent to about 360,000 tonnes."
5560,1989-90,"During 198990 aluminium production is likely to increase by another 20 per cent to reach a level of 435,000 tonnes."
5561,1989-90,NALCO is also exporting alumina and some aluminium and will earn about Rs 200 crores in foreign exchange during 198889.
5562,1989-90,India has thus emerged not only selfsufficient in aluminium metal but will generate exportable surplus in the years ahead.
5563,1989-90,"In view of this the Government has decided to decontrol the price and distribution of aluminium with effect from 1st March, 1989."
5564,1989-90,The dispersal of industry to backward areas remains a major plank of our industrial policy.
5565,1989-90,The principal barrier to industrial development in backward areas is the lack of infrastructure.
5566,1989-90,"Recently, the Government has announced a new approach to this in the form of the Growth Centre Scheme."
5567,1989-90,In the first phase 61 growth centres will be taken up and provided with infrastructure facilities of a high order.
5568,1989-90,"I have 9 provided Rs 20 crores as the Central contribution for this scheme in 198990 Plan and, depending on the pace of implementation, this will be enhanced, if necessary."
5569,1989-90,Let me now turn to the operation of capital markets.
5570,1989-90,"A substantial volume of personal savings now flows through the financial instruments traded in this market in fact, the breadth and depth of our financial structure is an asset that we must use to mobilise savings and channel it into productive directions."
5571,1989-90,"Our rural households are showing growing interest in investing in bonds, debentures and shares ."
5572,1989-90,"However, the provision regarding tax deduction at source is a disincentive."
5573,1989-90,"We have already raised the limit below which there will be no tax deduction at source to Rs 2,500 for dividends."
5574,1989-90,I propose to do the same for interest payments on bonds and debentures.
5575,1989-90,The flow of savings into the Capital Market is directed very much to fixed interest bonds and debentures.
5576,1989-90,"However, industrial development also requires risk capital in the form of equity."
5577,1989-90,"In order to stimulate the flow of personal savings into equity, the Government intends to introduce an EquityLinked Savings Scheme."
5578,1989-90,The Scheme will operate through UTI and recognised Mutual Funds and investments will be eligible for tax deductions on the basis of net annual additions to such savings.
5579,1989-90,Details of the Scheme will be announced shortly.
5580,1989-90,The dynamism shown by the industrial sector is to a certain extent the result of our effort to stimulate competition.
5581,1989-90,"However, as the industrial environment becomes more competitive, we will need effective measures for coping with the problems of industrial sickness."
5582,1989-90,"Some arrangements are in place under the Sick Industrial Companies Special Provisions Act, 1985."
5583,1989-90,"However, it is necessary that we take steps before this stage of sickness is reached to encourage and stimulate potentially sick units to rehabilitate themselves."
5584,1989-90,"In order to do this, the Government intends to work out an excise relief scheme for weak units to provide them with a proportion of their excise payments as part of a diversification, modernisation or rehabilitation package approved by designated Financial Institutions."
5585,1989-90,Other Areas Let me now turn to couple of other areas where I propose some changes.
5586,1989-90,The Government has been examining the utility of the Gold Control Act to see whether it has served its purpose or not and whether it requires any modification.
5587,1989-90,In the fight of this examination the Government proposes to modify the Gold Control Act with a view to keeping a measure of control over primary gold only.
5588,1989-90,"This is expected to benefit hundreds of thousands of goldsmiths and artisans who will be able to freely conduct their ageold traditional profession and provide better service to the customers in terms of quality, purity and price."
5589,1989-90,Further this will lead to a boost in the export of gold jewellery which has been stagnant.
5590,1989-90,The details will be worked out and necessary legislation will be introduced soon.
5591,1989-90,I have referred to the need to give a stimulus to savings and have already referred to two measures directed towards this end the Home Loan Account Scheme 10 and the Equity Linked Savings Scheme.
5592,1989-90,Several initiatives in the area of small savings have been taken in the recent years.
5593,1989-90,"I am happy to report to the House that the Indira Vikas Patra, introduced in 1986 and the Kisan Vikas Patra introduced in 1988 are attracting a substantial volume of savings."
5594,1989-90,These two savings instruments do not carry any tax concessions.
5595,1989-90,I propose to introduce a new National Savings Certificate Series VIII which will carry an interest rate of 12 per cent and will be eligible for tax concession under Section 80C but not under Section 80L.
5596,1989-90,The existing National Savings Certificates Series VI and VII will be discontinued.
5597,1989-90,This is part of the process of rationalisation of savings incentives.
5598,1989-90,I am conscious of the need to protect the savings of workers in the provident fund and their right to gratuity.
5599,1989-90,"The Employees Provident Fund Act has been modified to raise the minimum contribution to 8 113 per cent and this enhanced contribution has taken effect from 1st August, 1988."
5600,1989-90,The Payment of Gratuity Act has been amended to provide for compulsory insurance of gratuity liabilities or the setting up of a gratuity fund under incometax rules where the pattern of investment will be as prescribed by the Government from time to time.
5601,1989-90,It is proposed to implement these provisions soon after framing necessary rules.
5602,1989-90,"As the Hon’ble Members are aware, this Government has, in the recent past, taken various measures to help pensioners."
5603,1989-90,The Government is keen to ensure that pension and pensionary benefits are sanctioned and paid promptly and procedures for disbursement simplified.
5604,1989-90,"Towards this end, the Government has decided to further simplify the procedure of pension payment to civil pensioners who draw their pension from banks."
5605,1989-90,The proposed simplification envisages that the two intermediary agencies of Accountants General and District Treasuries will not be involved in this work which will be handled by a new Office of Chief Controller of Accounts Pensions in the Ministry of Finance.
5606,1989-90,The entire work of pension payment and accounting thereof will be computerised.
5607,1989-90,The new system is proposed to be introduced during 198990.
5608,1989-90,I also propose some fiscal relief on family pensions and a new savings scheme for retiring Government employees with certain tax concessions which I will revert to later.
5609,1989-90,Our freedom fighters have made great sacrifices in our struggle for independence.
5610,1989-90,"In this year when we are celebrating the birth centenary of one of the greatest leaders of this struggle, it is but appropriate that we raise the pension for freedom fighters to Rs 750 as a mark of the nation’s gratitude."
5611,1989-90,I shall now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198889 and the Budget Estimates for 198990.
5612,1989-90,"Since the presentation of the Budget for the current year, additional provisions have become necessary for certain inevitable increases in expenditure."
5613,1989-90,"The increases mainly relate to settlement of claims arising out of crop insurance scheme, subsidy for setting up of industries in backward areas, strengthening of equity base of Power Finance Corporation, payment to Shipping Companies to meet commitments made by the erstwhile Shipping Development Fund Committee and passing on to financial institutions rupee equivalent of external credits extended to them."
5614,1989-90,Central assistance for State and U.T. Plans is expected to be Rs 421 crores higher mainly due to special assistance that has to be provided to Punjab for financing its Plan outlay.
5615,1989-90,On the nonPlan side an additional provision of Rs 300 crores is required for export promotion and market development.
5616,1989-90,Subsidy on indigenous fertilizer will also be higher by Rs 250 crores.
5617,1989-90,A marginal increase of Rs 200 has been made in defence expenditure.
5618,1989-90,An additional provision of Rs 497 crores will be required for defence pensions on the basis of actual claims arising out of revision of defence pension rates.
5619,1989-90,Grant assistance to States affected y floods has to be increased by Rs 100 crores.
5620,1989-90,Provision of certain facilities in Punjab necessitated by security considerations has cost Rs 71 crores.
5621,1989-90,There have been other increases as well.
5622,1989-90,All these would have resulted in a much higher order of increase in nonPlan expenditure and in deficit financing.
5623,1989-90,Government have taken a number of measures to contain the increase in expenditure and improve receipts.
5624,1989-90,Ministries and Departments were instructed to locate savings to meet to the maximum extent possible the increases in expenditure including the liability for additional instalments of dearness allowance and bonus sanctioned to Government employees during the year.
5625,1989-90,The economy instructions issued last year were continued this year also.
5626,1989-90,"As a result of these measures, the increase in nonPlan expenditure has been contained."
5627,1989-90,Gross tax revenue is expected to yield Rs 776 crores more.
5628,1989-90,"The improvement is mainly in Union Excise duties, Customs duties and Corporation Tax."
5629,1989-90,Under nonTax Revenue the profit on imported edible oils is expected to show a sharp reduction owing to an increase in international prices.
5630,1989-90,Capital receipts are expected to show significant improvement.
5631,1989-90,Total receipts of Government are now estimated at Rs 67843 crores as against Rs 66076 crores in the Budget estimates.
5632,1989-90,Total expenditure is estimated at Rs 75783 crores as against the Budget estimate of Rs 73560 crores.
5633,1989-90,The overall deficit for the year is now estimated at Rs 7940 crores.
5634,1989-90,"Thus, in spite of the large additional burden thrown on the budget and the various concessions given it has been ensured that overall deficit does not increase substantially."
5635,1989-90,"Next year being the last year of the Seventh Five, Year Plan period every effort has been made to ensure that maximum resources are made available for 12 development."
5636,1989-90,"Budgetary support for Central Plan including special additional provision of Rs 500 crores for new economic programmes is placed at Rs 16,964 crores."
5637,1989-90,"Internal and extra budgetary resources for Central Plan are estimated at Rs 17,482 crores."
5638,1989-90,"The total Central Plan outlay for 198990 will thus be Rs 34,446 crores against the current year’s approved outlay of Rs 28,715 crores showing a step up of nearly 20 per cent."
5639,1989-90,Hon’ble Members will be happy to note that in real terms the actual outlay in the Central Sector for the five years would be around 115 per cent of the original Seventh Plan outlay.
5640,1989-90,"The Central Plan for 198990 places a great deal of emphasis on agriculture, rural development and related areas."
5641,1989-90,A new strategy for agricultural planning has been developed on the basis of different agroclimatic regions.
5642,1989-90,The provision for agriculture and irrigation in the Central Plan has been stepped up to Rs 1408 crores.
5643,1989-90,I also propose allocation of Rs 495 crores for the Department of Fertilizers.
5644,1989-90,The programmes of Rural Development are central to our Plan strategy.
5645,1989-90,"Inclusive of the provision for the new programme, the provision in the Central Plan for this sector has been stepped up by 28.4 per cent."
5646,1989-90,"For promoting rural industrialisation, the reorganised Khadi and Village Industries Commission has planned to expand and diversify its activities."
5647,1989-90,"Besides identifying 33 new industries for promotion in the current year, 41 other industries will be taken up for development in the future in a phased manner."
5648,1989-90,The provision for social services in the Central Plan is being stepped up to Rs 3396 crores.
5649,1989-90,"The main emphasis in the social welfare programme in the Annual Plan 198990 will be on development of services for early childhood care, women’s development, prevention of disabilities and rehabilitation of the affected persons."
5650,1989-90,"In order to meet these goals, a large expansion is envisaged in programmes like Integrated Child Development Service ICDS, incomegenerating schemes for poor and destitute women, education, training and economic rehabilitation of disabled persons."
5651,1989-90,"Adequate attention will be given to creating awareness regarding the rights of women, campaign against the atrocities inflicted on them and also against the social evils like child marriage, dowry, drug abuse, etc. 67."
5652,1989-90,The Seventh Plan has been characterised by a special thrust towards human resources development.
5653,1989-90,"The approach, strategies and major thrust areas included in the Seventh Five Year Plan and the priority programmes of the National Policy on Education 1986, taken up in 198788 are being continued."
5654,1989-90,"Emphasis is given on universalisation of elementary education, eradication of adult illiteracy, vocationalisation."
5655,1989-90,"In order to maintain the tempo of growth that has been attained in recent years, it is necessary that we continue to invest in the expansion and modernisation of 13 our infrastructure sectors."
5656,1989-90,"Hence, the outlays in the Central Plan for Power development have been raised by 38.6 per cent, for Railways by 15.6 per cent and for Telecommunications by 56.6 per cent."
5657,1989-90,Major public sector projects in the industrial sector included in the Seventh Plan have either been completed or are expected to be completed in the last year of the Plan.
5658,1989-90,"These include the expansion of Bhilai Steel Plant, Stage I of Visakhapatnarn Steel Plant, the Aluminium Complex of NALCO in Orissa, the gas based fertilizer plants at Bijaippur, Aonla, Namrup III, the Caprolactam project at Udyogmandal, captive power plants at Durgapur, Barauni, Panipat and Bhatinda and the Maharashtra Gas Cracker Complex."
5659,1989-90,"In the industry sector adequate outlays have been provided in the Annual Plan 198990 for productive schemes and projects of ongoing nature which would be commissioned during the last year of the Seventh Plan, as wen as for initiating the necessary preliminary action for the Eighth Plan."
5660,1989-90,"Central assistance for the Plans of State and Union territory Governments is placed at Rs 10,850 crores against the current year’s Budget level of Rs 9,714 crores."
5661,1989-90,"Total expenditure from Central Budget on Plan account will be Rs 27,814 crores next year as against current year’s Budget level of Rs 25,714 crores."
5662,1989-90,Government is aware of the extremely difficult circumstances in which our brave armed forces have been carrying out their arduous responsibilities of defending our country.
5663,1989-90,The whole nation owes its grateful thanks to them for ensuring the security of our borders and for bringing credit to our country when called upon to help other friendly countries in their hour of need.
5664,1989-90,"At the same time, all of us recognise that there is continuing need for implementing measures for greater cost effectiveness in our expenditure on defence."
5665,1989-90,My colleagues in the Ministry of Defence have already introduced a number of measures to improve the cost effectiveness of such expenditure.
5666,1989-90,Keeping this in view I have provided for a sum of Rs 13000 crores for Defence during the coming year.
5667,1989-90,I assure the House that Government will not falter in ensuring the highest level of defence preparedness.
5668,1989-90,"Provision for food, fertilizer and export promotion subsidies next year is Rs 7,412 crores against Rs 6,841 crores in the current year’s Revised Estimates."
5669,1989-90,"Interest charges next year are estimated at Rs 17,000 crores against Rs 14,150 crores in the current year."
5670,1989-90,Grants to States as a result of the recommendations of the Ninth Finance Commission are estimated to be Rs 612 crores higher than in the current year.
5671,1989-90,An additional provision of Rs 152 crores has been made next year for expenses in connection with the General Elections.
5672,1989-90,The deficit of Department of Posts is estimated to be.
5673,1989-90,Rs 97 crores higher than in the current year.
5674,1989-90,Every effort has been made to contain the growth.
5675,1989-90,"Total nonPlan expenditure 14 in 198990 is estimated at Rs 54,347 crores against Rs 48,877 crores in the Revised Estimates for the current year."
5676,1989-90,"Coming to Receipts, Gross Tax Revenue at the existing rate of taxation is estimated at Rs 49,588 crores."
5677,1989-90,"After payment of Rs 12,054 crores to States as their share of taxes and Rs 50 crores to local bodies in Union territories as assignment of revenue, the net accrual to Centre is estimated at Rs 37,484 crores against Rs 32,652 crores in the current year."

5680,1989-90,"Taking into account the variations in other receipts and expenditure, the overall deficit for next year at existing rates of taxation is estimated at Rs 8240 crores."
5681,1989-90,PART B I now turn to my tax proposals for 198990.
5682,1989-90,For most people taxation is vexation.
5683,1989-90,I will only say that we raise resources through taxation to fulfil a larger common purpose and seek to return to people a benefit which is greater than the cost they bear.
5684,1989-90,My budget proposals are guided by the objectives and economic perspectives I have outlined earlier.
5685,1989-90,"More specifically the proposals are oriented to the following ends:  promoting productive employment,  protecting the consumption standards of the poor,  discouraging nonessential luxury consumption particularly when it is import intensive,  providing some relief to middle income taxpayers,  maintaining the tempo of industrial modernisation and growth,  containing the budget deficit for 198990."
5686,1989-90,Now I turn to the budget proposals regarding the direct taxes.
5687,1989-90,The Hon’ble Members are aware of the high priority the Government attaches to creation of productive employment.
5688,1989-90,"As I mentioned earlier, a number of schemes are already being implemented to generate employment in rural areas to benefit the vulnerable sections of our society."
5689,1989-90,"However, we feel that a time has come for taking initiative to make a substantial dent on the problem of unemployment."
5690,1989-90,"To this end, as already stated, Government proposes to introduce a new intensive rural employment programme, to be called Jawaharlal Nehru Rojgar Yojana."
5691,1989-90,"In order to 15 mobilise resources for this programme, I propose to levy a surcharge at the rate of 8 per cent."
5692,1989-90,"I am sure that those who are privileged to have employment in a society, where there are so many who are deprived, will not mind this sacrifice in the interest of creating employment for those not so fortunate."
5693,1989-90,The Government has maintained stability in the direct tax rates during the last four years.
5694,1989-90,"However, it has often been represented that a 25 per cent."
5695,1989-90,"Accordingly, it is proposed to reduce the rate of tax for individuals in the entry slab of Rs 1800025000 from the present rate of 25 per cent."
5696,1989-90,"This House is aware of the fact that in order to mobilise resources to meet the requirements of the drought in 1987 and its aftereffects in 1988, a surcharge on incometax and wealthtax was levied."
5697,1989-90,I do not propose to continue the Wealth Tax and IncomeTax surcharge from the assessment year 198990 and 199091 respectively.
5698,1989-90,"The combined effect of the changes that I am proposing with regard to the employment surcharge and the changes in the rate structure will be such that a person with a taxable income of below Rs 56,000/ will pay less tax than at present."
5699,1989-90,"The entire burden of additional directtax will fall on those with a taxable income above Rs 56,000/ per annum."
5700,1989-90,The revenue effect of this surcharge will be Rs 500 crores.
5701,1989-90,I have no doubt that the House will welcome this socially progressive measure.
5702,1989-90,"With a view to curbing conspicuous consumption, I propose to enhance the rate of expenditure tax under the Expenditure Tax Act, 1987, as applicable to certain hotels, from 10 per cent to 20 per cent."
5703,1989-90,This will yield an additional Rs 30 crores.
5704,1989-90,I now come to some measures for providing relief.
5705,1989-90,To meet the housing needs of the citizens has always been an important policy objective of the Government.
5706,1989-90,"In his Budget Speech for 198788, the Prime Minister envisaged a high priority for the housing sector and had announced the decision to set up a National Housing Bank."
5707,1989-90,Necessary legislation in this regard has been passed and the National Housing Bank has become operational.
5708,1989-90,"In order to help the National Housing Bank mobilise resources in its nascent stage, I propose to provide that the deposits made in the Home Loan Account Scheme of the National Housing Bank as well as the repayment of housing loan taken from the Bank will qualify for deduction provided under section 80C of the Incometax Act."
5709,1989-90,The investment will also be exempt from wealthtax subject to the overall ceiling of Rs 5 lakhs.
5710,1989-90,"Further, the taxpayers will now get a tax concession under section 54E on capital gains if the sale proceeds are invested in the bonds and debentures issued by the National Housing Bank."
5711,1989-90,Poultry farming is emerging as an important activity for enhancing nutrition and providing employment.
5712,1989-90,"I, therefore, propose to provide tax exemption to the income from poultry fanning at the rate of thirtythree and onethird per cent."
5713,1989-90,This measure should go a long way in encouraging investment in this area.
5714,1989-90,Retiring Government employees are often on the look out for investment opportunities with a good posttax return.
5715,1989-90,"With this view, it is proposed to set up a deposit scheme in which a retiring employee may invest the whole or part of his retirement benefits for a block period of three years."
5716,1989-90,The interest on this investment will be free from incometax.
5717,1989-90,"Further, this investment will also be exempt from wealthtax."
5718,1989-90,The present ceiling of exemption of wealth upto
5719,1989-90,Rs 5 lakhs in respect of wealth in certain specified forms will also not apply to such deposits.
5720,1989-90,"As a measure for providing relief to the widows and heirs of deceased employees, I propose to amend the provisions of the Incometax Act, to provide a standard deduction at the rate of thirtythree and onethird per cent., subject to a maximum of Rs 12,000/, for the recipient of family pension also."
5721,1989-90,"Similarly, it is proposed to extend the benefit of deduction of Rs 15,000/, already available to permanently physically handicapped persons, to persons who are mentally retarded."
5722,1989-90,"Hon’ble Members are aware that under the Constitution Amendment Act, 1998 the ceiling of tax on professions has been raised from Rs 250 to Rs 2,500 per annum with the object of enabling the State Governments to raise additional resources."
5723,1989-90,I hope that the States will take full advantage of this.
5724,1989-90,I propose to provide that this tax be allowed as a deduction in computing the income under ‘Salaries’.
5725,1989-90,"Following the announcements made in the budget speech for 198889, Government has formulated schemes setting up the Exchange Risk Administration Fund and issued guidelines for venture capital companies I funds which provide assistance to new entrepreneurs."
5726,1989-90,In order to extend fiscal support to these funds.
5727,1989-90,I propose to extend certain tax concessions to them.
5728,1989-90,"Revenue loss, if any."
5729,1989-90,By a notification of the President issued on 7th November.
5730,1989-90,"In view of some operational difficulties, I now propose to extend the ‘Incometax Act, 1961 to Sikkim only from the assessment year 199091."
5731,1989-90,The Wealthtax Act and the Gifttax Act have already been extended from 199091 assessment year by the Central Government’s notification.
5732,1989-90,I shall now proceed to deal with my proposals relating to indirect taxes.
5733,1989-90,"In formulating these proposals, I have been guided by the imperative need for raising additional resources."
5734,1989-90,"In doing so, I have taken care to see that items of 17 mass consumption are not unduly affected and that the burden falls largely on relatively affluent sections of the population."
5735,1989-90,"As the House is aware, problems of evasion of excise duties through undervaluation and related administrative problems have led to specific rather than ad valorem duties on a large number of commodities."
5736,1989-90,"In fact, of the total excise revenue, about 70% is derived from commodities carrying duties at specific rates."
5737,1989-90,"In the case of many commodities which are subject to specific rates of excise duty, the duty incidence is at substantially lower than what it was when the specific duties were fixed originally."
5738,1989-90,There has to be a system whereby all specific rates are revised upwards periodically keeping in view price increases.
5739,1989-90,I propose to make a beginning in this regard in this Budget by increasing the existing specific duty rates of a substantial number of commodities by a modest five per cent of current rates with suitable rounding off.
5740,1989-90,I hasten to add that I have taken care to ensure that items of mass consumption are kept outside the purview of this adjustment.
5741,1989-90,"The items on which t ‘ here will be no change in the rates of excise duly include sugar, tea, coffee, petroleum products like kerosene, diesel and motor spirit, biris, vegetable oils, vanaspati, cotton yarn and fabrics, jute yarn and fabrics and electric bulbs and fluorescent tubes."
5742,1989-90,"Similarly, the existing exemption for newsprint and specified paper intended for use in the printing of textbooks or other books of general interest remains unaltered."
5743,1989-90,It is expected that the upward revision of specific rates will yield an additional excise revenue of Rs 220 crores.
5744,1989-90,There are some commodities which are charged to excise duty at specific rates and which would call for a higher rate of adjustment than what has been proposed in general.
5745,1989-90,I now come to my proposals in regard to these commodities.
5746,1989-90,"In the case of iron and steel, the specific rates of duty have not been changed significantly for over a decade now."
5747,1989-90,"As a revenue raising measure, I propose to raise the rates of duty on these items."
5748,1989-90,The duty on pig iron is proposed to be increased from Rs 80 to Rs 200 per tonne.
5749,1989-90,"On steel items other than stainless steel, such as ingots, billets, bars, rods, etc. presently attracting duty of Rs 365 per tonne, I propose to increase the duty to Rs 500 per tonne."
5750,1989-90,"The duty on certain hot rolled flat products such as sheets, strips, etc. is Proposed to be raised from Rs 500 to Rs 700 per tonne."
5751,1989-90,"In respect of certain cold rolled flat products such as sheets and strips, the duty is proposed to be raised from Rs 715 to Rs 900 per tonne."
5752,1989-90,There are certain assessment disputes in the case of forgings and castings as the duty rates vary depending upon the classification.
5753,1989-90,"As a measure of rationalisation and to prevent such disputes, I propose to levy a uniform rate of duty of Rs 800 per tonne on steel forgings and Rs 600 per tonne on steel castings."
5754,1989-90,"In the case of stainless steel where the duty incidence is rather low, I propose to raise the duty on ingots, semifinished products and hot rolled products 18 from the existing rates to Rs 1000 per tonne and on certain cold rolled products from Rs 715 per tonne to Rs 1500 per tonne."
5755,1989-90,Stainless steel castings and forgings will also attract a duty of Rs 1500 per tonne.
5756,1989-90,Similar duty adjustments are proposed to be made on other iron and steel items.
5757,1989-90,"In the case of dutiable downstream products, MODVAT credit on iron and steel items would continue to be available."
5758,1989-90,These measures are expected to result in additional excise revenue to the tune of Rs 150 crores and customs revenue of Rs 18 crores.
5759,1989-90,No Finance Minister can resist the temptation of looking to smokers of cigarettes for augmenting excise revenue.
5760,1989-90,"I must confess that L like most of my predecessors, readily submitted to this temptation."
5761,1989-90,"Smokers who do not pay any heed to the statutory warning to their health should, I feel, at least contribute more to the health of the national economy."
5762,1989-90,I propose to restructure the duty rates on cigarettes.
5763,1989-90,"While generally the duty rates are being raised, the extent of increase would be more in the case of filter cigarettes of length above 70mm."
5764,1989-90,"However, nonfilter cigarettes of length upto 60 mm will carry a rate of excise duty of Re.1 per packet of 10."
5765,1989-90,These measures are estimated to yield excise revenue to the tune of Rs 101 crores.
5766,1989-90,"Having revised the duty structure on cigarettes, I would not like users of pan masala to feel aggrieved that they have been let down."
5767,1989-90,I propose to double the excise duty presently being levied on pan masala not containing tobacco for the two existing slabs based on value from Rs 10 and Rs 20 per kg.
5768,1989-90,"Simultaneously, I propose to increase the excise duty on pan masala containing tobacco from 25% to 30%."
5769,1989-90,The revenue implication of these measures is Rs 8 crores.
5770,1989-90,As the House is aware.
5771,1989-90,"In keeping with its end use, I feel, molasses can bear a higher incidence of duty than at present."
5772,1989-90,I accordingly propose to increase the excise duty on molasses from Rs 60 to Rs 120 per tonne.
5773,1989-90,I propose to increase suitably the credit of money that is presently available when alcohol is used in the manufacture of chemicals.
5774,1989-90,It is estimated that this measure will yield additional excise revenue to the tune of Rs 11 crores.
5775,1989-90,I have a couple of proposals relating to travel tax.
5776,1989-90,"At present, Foreign Travel Tax is being levied at the rate of Rs 50 per ticket for travel to neighbouring countries and Rs 100 per ticket in respect of travel to other countries."
5777,1989-90,These rates have not undergone any change since 1979.
5778,1989-90,I propose to increase the aforesaid rates of tax to Rs 150 and Rs 300 respectively.
5779,1989-90,"As the House is aware, Government has invested substantial sums of money in developing our airports and providing infrastructural facilities therein."
5780,1989-90,"Keeping 19 this fact in view, the privileged few who can afford to fly within the country should not mind if they are to pay a small extra amount as tax for augmenting revenues."
5781,1989-90,I intend to levy a new tax called Inland Air Travel Tax at 10% of the basic fare.
5782,1989-90,"However, I propose to exempt passengers paying air fare in foreign currency."
5783,1989-90,There will also be a provision for exempting deserving special categories of passengers from this tax.
5784,1989-90,The proposals relating to travel tax will be given effect to from a date to be notified later and are expected to yield additional revenue to the tune of Rs 85 crores.
5785,1989-90,"Having dealt with those who fly, I now turn to those who drive."
5786,1989-90,Let me deal with my proposals in regard to the automobile sector.
5787,1989-90,"As Honourable Members are aware, presently there is a concessional rate of excise duty of 25% in respect of fuel efficient cars of engine capacity not exceeding 1000 cc and 30% in respect of such cars of engine capacity exceeding 1000 cc as against the rate of 35% for other cars."
5788,1989-90,I feel fuel efficient cars have established themselves and there is no necessity to continue with the concessional rates any more.
5789,1989-90,I accordingly propose to levy a uniform rate of 35% on all motor cars.
5790,1989-90,This rate will apply to vans and jeeps also.
5791,1989-90,The revenue gain from this measure will be Rs 100 crores.
5792,1989-90,"Currently the excise duty on two wheelersof engine capacity not exceeding 100 cc is 15% and that on others, 25%, I propose to restructure the excise duty on two wheelers into a four tier regime."
5793,1989-90,The rate of duty on two wheelers upto 50cc will remain at the present level of 15%.
5794,1989-90,The duty on two wheelers between 50 and 100 cc is being raised from 15% to 20%.
5795,1989-90,There is no change in the rate of excise duty of 25% on two wheelers between 100 and 150 cc.
5796,1989-90,The rate of duty on two wheelers above 150 cc will be 30%.
5797,1989-90,This measure is expected to yield additional revenue of about Rs 26 crores.
5798,1989-90,I also propose to give some concessions in customs duties to this sector keeping in view the need to encourage domestic production and hasten the process of indigenisation.
5799,1989-90,"I further propose to prescribe a concessional duty of 40% on machinery imported for the manufacture of fuel injection equipment, which is a vital component for the automobile sector."
5800,1989-90,The same rate would be applicable to components imported for manufacture of fuel injection equipment.
5801,1989-90,The concessional rate would be available only to the units manufacturing under an approved phased manufacturing programme.
5802,1989-90,The concessions in customs duty to the automotive sector will have a revenue implication of Rs 19 crores.
5803,1989-90,I now come to the package of measures relating to the electronics sector.
5804,1989-90,This is one of the fast growing sectors in our economy and is in a position to contribute 20 more to the exchequer.
5805,1989-90,My proposals in regard to this sector are oriented to giving a greater stimulus to the process of indigenisation.
5806,1989-90,The Members of the House are aware that television has offered considerable entertainment to our people.
5807,1989-90,It would be in the fitness of things that television viewers who derive such entertainment should contribute more to the resources of Government and thereby to the programmes of national development.
5808,1989-90,"At present, black and white television sets of screen size exceeding 15 cm and upto 36 cm are completely exempted from excise duty."
5809,1989-90,"While continuing the exemption for such sets, I propose to increase the excise duty on the picture tube of such sets to Rs 200 per tube."
5810,1989-90,Black and white television sets of screen size exceeding 36 cm attract excise duty of Rs 300 per set.
5811,1989-90,I propose to increase this rate to Rs 500 per set.
5812,1989-90,"As regards colour television sets, the present duty is Rs 1500 per set of assessable value upto Rs 5000 and Rs 2000 per set of assessable value more than Rs 5000."
5813,1989-90,This duty structure has led to some valuation disputes.
5814,1989-90,Some high value sets have also entered the market.
5815,1989-90,A review of the duty structure on colour television sets is therefore called for.
5816,1989-90,"I propose to fix a duty of Rs 2250 per set without remote control, Rs 2500 per set with remote control and Rs 4000 per set having the facility of ‘Picture in picture’."
5817,1989-90,"I also propose to fix a uniform rate of 20% on radios, twoinones, cassette recorders and musical systems, as against the present rates of 15% or 20%."
5818,1989-90,I propose to increase the excise duty on computers from 10% to 15% ad valorem.
5819,1989-90,"At the same time, computers are being taken out of the general scheme of exemption for the small scale sector."
5820,1989-90,"Presently, specified raw materials and piece parts imported for the manufacture of specified electronic components attract customs duty at the rates of 35% and 50% respectively."
5821,1989-90,"While extending concessional duty to a larger number of items, I propose to raise these rates to 40% and 60% respectively."
5822,1989-90,These proposals relating to electronic items are estimated to yield additional revenue to the tune of Rs 158 crores in excise and Rs 36.5 crores in customs.
5823,1989-90,I have some concessions in customs duty to announce for the electronics sector.
5824,1989-90,"In last year’s Budget, a uniform rate of import duty of 100% was provided to a large number of equipments for telecommunication, satellite communication, data communication, television transmission and studio and sound broadcasting."
5825,1989-90,I propose to extend the concession to 35 more specified equipments.
5826,1989-90,Optical communication cables are essential for telecommunication.
5827,1989-90,"In order to encourage the manufacture of such cables in the country, I propose to reduce 21 the import duty on specified raw materials required for their manufacture from the present rates varying from 130 to 300% to the level of 80%."
5828,1989-90,"With a view to encouraging production of hightech items like large scale integrated circuits, microprocessors and other microelectronic items, 22 items of machinery have been given a concessional import duty of 15 %."
5829,1989-90,I propose to extend the concession to five more items of machinery.
5830,1989-90,The concessions in customs duty to the electronics sector will have a revenue implication of Rs 33 crores.
5831,1989-90,I have a package of measures in regard to the customs duty structure for capital goods.
5832,1989-90,"At the time of presenting the 1987 Budget, the Hon’ble Prime Minister had emphasised the importance of the capital goods industry and had stated that it is central to our efforts for achieving self reliance and to promote the growth of this sector."
5833,1989-90,Important steps were initiated that year.
5834,1989-90,The success brought forth by these measures encourages us to continue further along those lines.
5835,1989-90,"My first proposal is, to extend the duty concession for import of machinery under the technology upgradation scheme for the capital goods industry to four more sectors."
5836,1989-90,"These are cutting tools, commercial tool rooms, textile machinery and paper machinery."
5837,1989-90,"In addition, for the machine tool sector, I propose to expand the list of machinery items attracting concessional duty."
5838,1989-90,I propose to rationalise the import tariff of capital goods.
5839,1989-90,The rate of import duty on general projects and machinery is being reduced from the existing 90% to 80% ad valorem.
5840,1989-90,The rate of duty on components which is 15% below the rate applicable to the machinery would get correspondingly reduced.
5841,1989-90,The next step in this regard would be rationalising the rate of concessional import duty on specified machinery which presently varies between 25% to 35%.
5842,1989-90,This is being unified and fixed at 40% ad valorem.
5843,1989-90,"There would, however, be no change in the case of fertilizer projects."
5844,1989-90,"In the case of power projects, the increase would be by five percentage points."
5845,1989-90,The rationale for these changes lies in the desirability of reducing the dispersion in tariff rates as much as possible.
5846,1989-90,"In pursuit of this objective, I am introducing an intermediate level of duty of 60% ad valorem."
5847,1989-90,"This will apply to certain specified items of machinery which are manufactured indigenously such as captive power plants, certain types of generating sets and circular looms for jute industry."
5848,1989-90,"As a measure of facilitating the export thrust sectors to upgrade their technology by importing modern machinery, concessional duties have been prescribed from time to time on machinery for specified thrust sectors."
5849,1989-90,I propose to extend the 22 concession to rubber and canvas footwear sector and to expand the existing list of machinery for textile and sericulture sectors.
5850,1989-90,These measures relating to capital goods are estimated to result in a loss of customs revenue of about Rs 117 crores.
5851,1989-90,"As I have mentioned earlier in my speech, pricing and distribution of aluminium is being decontrolled with immediate effect."
5852,1989-90,"In this context, I propose to increase the excise duty on aluminium ingots and wirerods from the existing level of 18% to 20% ad valorem plus Rs 2500 per tonne."
5853,1989-90,"Since MODVAT credit in regard to primary aluminium would be available for dutiable downstream products, I propose to increase the duty on most of such products by ten percentage points."
5854,1989-90,It is also proposed to exempt aluminium ingots from basic and auxiliary duties of customs.
5855,1989-90,The basic customs duty on aluminium scrap is being reduced from 30% to 15%.
5856,1989-90,The net revenue yield from these measures will be Rs 50 crores.
5857,1989-90,There are certain commodities which attract a low rate of customs duty at present and these call for a review.
5858,1989-90,"I propose to ram the import duty on wood pulp, waste paper, low ash coal, raw petroleum coke and certain chemicals by five percentage points over the existing rates."
5859,1989-90,"On benzene, I propose to raise the basic custom duty from the existing nil rate to 25% ad valorem."
5860,1989-90,The revenue gain from these proposals will be Rs 39 crores.
5861,1989-90,I propose to increase the basic customs duty on glazed newsprint from Rs 550 per tonne to 30% ad valorem.
5862,1989-90,This will yield additional revenue of about Rs 12 crores.
5863,1989-90,Watches and components thereof presently bear a low rate of excise duty of 2% ad valorem.
5864,1989-90,This rate was fixed in order to encourage indigenous production of watches.
5865,1989-90,This measure has been successful.
5866,1989-90,I think the time has come when the watch industry can bear a higher duty.
5867,1989-90,I propose to increase the rate to 5% ad valorem.
5868,1989-90,This will result in a revenue gain of Rs 5 crores.
5869,1989-90,I shall now deal with my package of proposals in regard to the agrobased and related industries.
5870,1989-90,"As Honourable Members are aware, the growth of food processing and packaging industry is essential for increasing value addition of agricultural produce and raising incomes of farmers."
5871,1989-90,"As part of Budget proposals last year, excise duty on parts and accessories going into the installation of cold storage plants for preserving foodstuffs was reduced from 40% to 15%."
5872,1989-90,I now propose to extend the concessional rate of 15% to parts of refrigerating appliances and machinery as well as compressors intended to be used in refrigerated vans meant for transport of food and dairy products.
5873,1989-90,"At present, 34 specified items of food processing and packaging machinery enjoy a concessional import duty of 35%."
5874,1989-90,I propose to extend the concessional rate 23 to a few more specified items of machinery such as transport refrigeration unit and machinery for egg processing.
5875,1989-90,The concessional rate of duty as stated earlier is now being fixed at 40%.
5876,1989-90,I propose to reduce the excise duty on skimmed milk powder and condensed milk from 15% to 10%.
5877,1989-90,Simultaneously the exemption from excise duty on skimmed milk powder in one kilogram pack is being withdrawn.
5878,1989-90,"The excise duty on certain other food preparations such as preparations of fish, meat, tapioca and sago in unit containers is being reduced from 15% to 10%."
5879,1989-90,Namkeens such as bujiyas and chabena and specified readytocook mixes such as idlimix and vadamix are being fully exempted from excise duty.
5880,1989-90,A concessional import duty of 61% has been provided for certain specified items of machinery for marine food sector.
5881,1989-90,I propose to further reduce the rate to 40% and enlarge the list by adding three more items of machinery for fishing.
5882,1989-90,"In addition, I propose to reduce the import duty on machinery for the manufacture of fish nels from 90% to 40%."
5883,1989-90,"One of the proposals contained in the New Policy on Seed Development announced in September, 1988 relates to the reduction of import duty on machines and equipments used for seed production and processing and quality control for which technology upgradation is necessary."
5884,1989-90,I propose to prescribe a concessional import duty of 40% on 12 specified items of such machinery and equipments.
5885,1989-90,"In order to help improve the quality of poultry feed, I propose to reduce the import duty on two specified amino acids from the present level of 147.25% to 70%."
5886,1989-90,"To give relief to the jute industry, I propose to exempt from excise duty jute yam supplied to a registered handloom cooperative society or an organisation set up or approved by the Government."
5887,1989-90,This exemption will be available for the purpose of development of handlooms for manufacture of fabrics other than those used for jute sacks.
5888,1989-90,I also propose to extend this exemption to units set up by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission and Boards.
5889,1989-90,Paper and paperboard containing not less than 75% by weight of bagasse is totally exempted from excise duty.
5890,1989-90,"In order to further encourage the use of unconventional raw materials for the manufacture of paper and thus reduce the pressure on forest based raw materials, I propose to extend full excise duty concession to those varieties of paper and paper board which contain not less than 75% of pulp made from raw jute or mesta."
5891,1989-90,This measure may incidentally help the jute industry.
5892,1989-90,"For helping the farmers to get better prices for their produce, I propose to increase the basic customs duty on cinnamon from Rs 20 per kg to 90% ad valorem plus Rs 20 per kg and that on cloves from Rs 60 to Rs 95 per kg."
5893,1989-90,"To give a major thrust to marketing of products of the Khadi and Village Industries sector, I propose to make an exception in regard to availability of small scale concession where the products bear the brand name of Khadi and Village Industries Commission and Boards."
5894,1989-90,The existing concession for products of village industry marketed by or with the assistance of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission is being extended to furniture and ceramic products.
5895,1989-90,These measures relating to agrobased and related industries are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 5 crores of customs duty and Rs 8 crores of excise duty.
5896,1989-90,"On a review of the excise duty structure for the match industry, I feel there is need for revising the duty rates for the different sectors of the industry."
5897,1989-90,"Currently, excise duty is being levied on the mechanised, semimechanised, nonmechanised and cottage sectors of the industry at Rs 5.85, Rs 4.15, Rs 3.50 and Rs 1.60 per gross of boxes respectively."
5898,1989-90,"I propose to bring down the aforementioned rates to Rs 4.50, Rs 3.00, Rs 2.50 and Rs 1.10 per gross."
5899,1989-90,"Simultaneously, I propose to increase the excise duty on potassium chlorate, an essential raw material for the manufacture of matches, from 15 % ad valorem which works out to roughly Rs 2 per kilograrm to Rs 5 per kilogram."
5900,1989-90,"The duty rates will be converted into metric system and specified as applicable to 100 boxes with effect from the 1st June, 1989."
5901,1989-90,These proposals involve a revenue sacrifice of Rs 11 crores excise duties.
5902,1989-90,"In view of the shortage of cotton due to drought, as part of the Budget proposals last year, a concessional duty of Rs 5.22 per Kg. was prescribed on viscose staple fibre for blending with cotton."
5903,1989-90,"However, with the increased availability of cotton this year, there is no further necessity to continue the concession."
5904,1989-90,I propose to withdraw the concessional rate and fix a uniform rate of Rs 8.35 per Kg.
5905,1989-90,The revenue gain from this measure will be of the order of Rs 14 crores.
5906,1989-90,I propose to exempt raw wool to be imported by Khadi and Village Industries Commission and State Khadi and Village Industries Boards from the whole of the duty.
5907,1989-90,The customs duty on raw silk is being reduced from 75% to 50% ad valorem. 156.
5908,1989-90,Dyestuffs are important inputs for the processing of textiles.
5909,1989-90,This commodity carries at present an excise duty of 35%.
5910,1989-90,I propose to reduce the excise duty on synthetic organic dyestuffs from 35% to 30%.
5911,1989-90,This proposal which will benefit this textile related industry involves a revenue loss of Rs 19 crores.
5912,1989-90,Synthetic shoddy blankets of value upto
5913,1989-90,Rs 60 per square metre are being exempted from the whole of excise duty.
5914,1989-90,I propose to give certain concessions in customs duty to specified life saving drugs and drug intermediates.
5915,1989-90,The proposals in this regard are likely to result in a revenue loss of about Rs 7 crores.
5916,1989-90,"In order to give relief to cement units using vertical shaft kiln, I propose to reduce the excise duty on cement manufactured by such units by Rs 100 per tonne from the general effective rate."
5917,1989-90,This involves a revenue loss of Rs 10 crores.
5918,1989-90,"As a step towards energy conservation, I propose to reduce the excise duty on high pressure sodium vapour lamps from 15% to 10%."
5919,1989-90,"Simultaneously, I propose to prescribe a concessional import duty of 50% on four specified inputs forthe manufacture of such lamps."
5920,1989-90,These measures are estimated to result in revenue loss of Rs 2.5 crores in excise revenue and Rs 5 crores in customs revenue.
5921,1989-90,There have been representations that the film industry has been adversely hit by video piracy.
5922,1989-90,I accordingly propose to restructure the excise duty rates on feature films.
5923,1989-90,"As per the revised proposal, the first 30 prints of each feature film would be eligible for complete exemption from excise duty as against the first 12 prints at present."
5924,1989-90,The rates of duty on subsequent prints are being reduced.
5925,1989-90,Some of the organisations engaged in the rehabilitation of physically or mentally handicapped persons undertake manufacturing activity for providing employment to such persons.
5926,1989-90,"Presently, such organisations are eligible for excise duty exemption only to the extent available for specified goods manufactured in the small scale sector."
5927,1989-90,I propose to fully exempt such goods produced by these organisations.
5928,1989-90,"In order to promote safety in chemical industry and environmental control, I propose to extend concessional import duty of 40% on 25 specified equipments such as monitoring instruments for toxic and hazardous chemicals or gases, special incinerating systems etc. 164."
5929,1989-90,Paraxylene is an important raw material used in the manufacture of DMT and PTA which in turn are used by the polyester industry.
5930,1989-90,Keeping in view the recent trends in the international price of paraxylenej propose to reduce the import duty on paraxylene from 120% to 90%.
5931,1989-90,There are a few rationalisation and antievasion measures relating to customs and excise duties.
5932,1989-90,"Presently, petrochemical factories are eligible for certain concessions including concessional excise duty on naphtha when they are declared as refineries."
5933,1989-90,"The present scheme has been reviewed and I propose to make available the concessions with certain modifications, without linking the concessions to the declaration of a factory as a refinery."
5934,1989-90,"Simultaneously, I propose to raise the concessional rate of duty 26 on raw naphtha from Rs 30 to Rs 60 per kl."
5935,1989-90,The orders declaring certain factories as refineries are being rescinded.
5936,1989-90,Small scale units are allowed complete exemption from excise duty upto a value of Rs 30 lakhs in case they manufacture goods falling under more than one heading of the Central Excise Tariff.
5937,1989-90,I propose to restructure the scheme so that the exemption upto Rs 30 lakhs is available only if the goods falling under more than one Chapter of the Central Excise Tariff are manufactured.
5938,1989-90,The details of the revenue implications of the measures announced are given in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Finance Bill.
5939,1989-90,Provision is being made in the Finance Bill for continuance of auxiliary duty of customs and special excise duty at the existing rates.
5940,1989-90,"Apart from the above proposals, I have proposed certain amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect changes in the excise and customs tariffs."
5941,1989-90,These amendments are merely enabling provisions and have no revenue significance.
5942,1989-90,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
5943,1989-90,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
5944,1989-90,"In the aggregate, the proposals in regard to changes in the customs and excise duties outlined above are likely to yield additional revenue of Rs 863.20 crores from excise duties and Rs 117.06 crores from customs duties."
5945,1989-90,The concessions and reliefs announced aggregate to Rs 237.12 crores on the customs side and Rs 71.02 crores on the excise side.
5946,1989-90,The net additional revenue from excise duties would thus be Rs 792.18 crores.
5947,1989-90,"On the customs side, there is a net revenue loss of Rs 120.06 crores."
5948,1989-90,"Besides, the changes in the Foreign Travel Tax and the levy of Inland Travel Tax would yield an additional revenue of Rs 85 crores."
5949,1989-90,"Thus, out of the total net additional yield of Rs 757.12 crores from indirect taxes, the Centre’s share would be Rs 373.13 crores and that of States Rs 383.99 crores."
5950,1989-90,The Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act is an enactment under Article 268 of the Constitution in terms of which duties are levied by the Union but collected and appropriated by the States.
5951,1989-90,"There has been no change in the rates of duties leviable on medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol, narcotics and narcotic drugs since 1982."
5952,1989-90,There have been requests from the State Governments that the rates should be reviewed and revised suitably.
5953,1989-90,"While I do not propose to make any changes in the ad valorem rates, I propose to increase the specific rates by about 50% of the existing rates."
5954,1989-90,The details of the changes made in the Schedule are given in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Finance Bill.
5955,1989-90,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from 1st March, 1989 will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
5956,1989-90,The modifications proposed by me in direct and indirect taxes are expected to yield Rs 903 crores to the Centre.
5957,1989-90,Taking this into account the year end deficit for the next year is estimated at Rs 7337 crores.
5958,1989-90,"Sir, the proposals I have just presented mark, in their totality, a qualitatively new stage in our continuing quest for social justice."
5959,1989-90,"The new employment programme, which will expand over time, is the people’s own weapon in their struggle to usher in a society liberated from the shackles of poverty."
5960,1989-90,The budget proposals also reflect Government’s strong commitment to selfreliance.
5961,1989-90,"We are determined to vigourously implement strategies for export promotion, for modernisation of Indian industry and for efficient import substitution."
5962,1989-90,"Within these basic policy parameters, every effort will be made to contain imports to reasonable levels."
5963,1989-90,The journey along the path of development is hard and long.
5964,1989-90,The question is who will make such sacrifices for future growth and prosperity.
5965,1989-90,The answer of these budget proposals is clear and categorical.
5966,1989-90,It is the relatively affluent who will have to share a larger burden so that the weaker and vulnerable sections of society may share in the fruits of growth.
5967,1989-90,I commend the Budget to the House.
5968,1990-91,I deem it a great privilege to have the opportunity to present the first Budget of the new Government.
5969,1990-91,"The new Government, which secured a massive vote of confidence of this Honourable House, transcending political affiliations, made a tryst with the nation to respect and implement the mandate it received from the people."
5970,1990-91,I do so not in a spirit of acrimony but with a view to revealing to the House the ground realities.
5971,1990-91,"The Central Government’s budgetary deficit was Rs 13,790 crores as on Ist December, 1989, a level nearly double the deficit projected for the whole year in the 198990 budget."
5972,1990-91,Wholesale prices had risen by 6.6 per cent since the beginning of the financial year.
5973,1990-91,The balance of payment was under strain and foreign exchange reserves excluding gold and SDRs were down to around Rs 5000 crores.
5974,1990-91,Stocks of foodgrains had fallen to 11 million tonnes.
5975,1990-91,"On a broader scale, the Economic Survey which was placed on the Table of the House only a few days ago deals with the current economic situation."
5976,1990-91,I will not go into details but only highlight a few key points.
5977,1990-91,There has been some slowing down of growth in 198990.
5978,1990-91,"GDP is expected to rise by 4 to 4.5 per cent, industrial output by about 6 per cent and agricultural output by 1 per cent or so on the peak level reached in the previous year."
5979,1990-91,The price rise this year affects several commodity groups and the pressure of inflation is clearly linked to the fiscal imbalance.
5980,1990-91,The budget deficit and money supply growth have been running well above target.
5981,1990-91,"The Revised Estimates for 1989 90, which I will present a little later, indicate that the budget deficit is expected to be substantially higher than Rs 7337 crores projected in the budget estimates for 1989 90."
5982,1990-91,"The growth rate of aggregate monetary resources was 16.5 per cent from the beginning of the financial year to 23rd February, 1990."
5983,1990-91,"As regards the trade performance this year, exports have grown at the rate of 38 per cent and imports at 21 per cent in rupee terms in the first nine months of the year."
5984,1990-91,But the pressure on reserves continues as the improvement on trade account is not sufficient to counterbalance the increase in debtservice obligations.
5985,1990-91,I have drawn attention to these features in order to highlight the constraints within which the new Government has to look for ways of fulfilling its mandate.
5986,1990-91,The first task of the new Government was to contain the rise in prices.
5987,1990-91,"A Cabinet Committee on Prices was formed and effective steps were taken to increase the supply of essential commodities, break the inflationary psychology and contain inflation."
5988,1990-91,"The price situation, however, remains a matter for concern and the management of inflation is one of the priority areas for this Government."
5989,1990-91,Adequate stocks of foodgrains are essential for maintaining price stability and our economic security.
5990,1990-91,The Government has given a high priority to stepping up procurement efforts and to rebuilding of stocks.
5991,1990-91,"As a result, the procurement of rice has touched a new high of about 10 million tonnes already."
5992,1990-91,Foodgrains stocks in the central pool have been augmented and stand at 11.67 million tonnes at the beginning of February compared to 8.34 million tonnes at the same time last year.
5993,1990-91,Special attention has been given to increasing supplies of essential commodities and streamlining the Public Distribution System.
5994,1990-91,Market intervention operations are being undertaken to stabilise open market prices of some sensitive commodities.
5995,1990-91,Another major problem before the country is the strain on our balance of payments position.
5996,1990-91,"In the last few years, large trade and current account deficits have been financed through depletion of foreign exchange reserves and growing recourse to foreign borrowings."
5997,1990-91,"To combat the pressures on the balance of payments and to ensure a viable situation over the Eighth Plan period, exports must command the highest priority."
5998,1990-91,The alternative of higher foreign borrowing to finance our essential import requirements runs the risk of mortgaging our hard won economic independence.
5999,1990-91,"Therefore, the new Import Export Policy 199093, to be announced on 1.4.1990, will accord top priority to exports and will give special encouragement for exports which earn high net foreign exchange."
6000,1990-91,The priority for exports will also be reflected in our industrial policy and later I will outline some fiscal measures to promote export production.
6001,1990-91,Our import bill for bulk items is increasing rapidly.
6002,1990-91,"The oil consumption, for example, has been rising at the rate of around 8 per cent in the recent past."
6003,1990-91,There has been a huge outflow of foreign exchange on this account.
6004,1990-91,India’s foreign debt has been doubled in the last five years.
6005,1990-91,This has added to our vulnerability.
6006,1990-91,The trend has to be reversed.
6007,1990-91,I am convinced that our people will make any sacrifice and meet any challenge in order to preserve our economic independence and spirit of selfreliance.
6008,1990-91,We are ready to go through a period of austerity and hardship in order to avoid excessive foreign borrowings.
6009,1990-91,The fiscal imbalance is the root cause of the twin problems of inflation and the difficult balance of payments position.
6010,1990-91,One of the targets of the Seventh Five Year Plan which was over achieved was deficit financing.
6011,1990-91,"While the projected deficit in the 7th Plan period was Rs 14000 crores, in reality it was more than double."
6012,1990-91,The management of the deficit will require the containment of expenditure growth.
6013,1990-91,But the restraint of expenditure also requires careful consideration of other areas of public spending which involve implicit or explicit subsidies.
6014,1990-91,We have to ask ourselves whether these subsidies are really reaching the people they are meant to serve or whether there is a better way of providing the same benefit.
6015,1990-91,"On the revenue side, the real issue is of tax compliance."
6016,1990-91,"This generates black money and has other serious adverse effects on the economy, such as fuelling inflation and conspicuous consumption."
6017,1990-91,"Black money is also generated by shortages, artificially pegged prices and detailed physical controls."
6018,1990-91,The “leakages” from public expenditure programmes also cause serious distortions in the economic and social structure of our society.
6019,1990-91,We will launch a sustained and multipronged drive against proliferation of black money which is a social sin and an economic evil.
6020,1990-91,"To improve tax compliance, we shall combine reasonable tax rates and simpler tax laws with effective tax administration and strong deterrents against evasion."
6021,1990-91,"The Revenue Department is being instructed to pay special attention to vulgar display of illgotten wealth, particularly on occasions, such as wedding receptions."
6022,1990-91,"We will come down with a heavy hand on those who give vent to their pomp and money power, by circumventing our laws and frittering away the scarce resources of the nation."
6023,1990-91,The Economic Intelligence Bureau is being revamped to coordinate action against tax evaders and black money operators.
6024,1990-91,The Act on “benarni” transactions will be recast to make it more difficult for economic offenders to hold wealth in “benami” forms.
6025,1990-91,Administrative curbs against black money must be backed by economic measures.
6026,1990-91,We must reduce the scope of discretionary powers which provide sustenance to black money.
6027,1990-91,"Our economic policies will place greater reliance on general, non discretionary, fiscal and financial instruments and will reduce the role of ad hoc discretionary physical controls."
6028,1990-91,I have also received some suggestions from Honourable Members and fiscal experts on incentive scheme for “unearthing” of black money and channelling it into desired directions.
6029,1990-91,"The advantage claimed for such schemes is that, instead of being used for conspicuous consumption or unproductive investment, the unaccounted money can be diverted to create jobs or to serve some other socially useful purpose."
6030,1990-91,The disadvantage is that these schemes generally provide for a more concessional tax treatment of the black money than the rates normally applicable.
6031,1990-91,The different schemes tried out in the past did not yield much and were open to misuse.
6032,1990-91,Human ingenuity manifests itself in strange ways.
6033,1990-91,"In the past, it found expression in converting the bearer bonds, issued with the laudable objective of bringing out black money, into alternate currency that exchanged hands at a premium."
6034,1990-91,Thus the instrument to render 3 black money white was itself used with vengeance to reconvert white money into black!
6035,1990-91,"Nevertheless, in the present situation, when our needs are large and resources are tight, there is perhaps a case for introducing a timebound scheme which would permit undeclared incomes and hidden wealth to be used for one or more social purposes, such as, slum clearance, building of houses for lower and middle income groups, and setting up of specified agrobased industries in rural/backward areas."
6036,1990-91,"Subject to certain conditions, the source of monies declared under this scheme need not be questioned."
6037,1990-91,There could be a suitable flat rate of tax on such income.
6038,1990-91,The Government would like to have a thorough debate in the Parliament before introducing a scheme of this type.
6039,1990-91,I would very much welcome the views of the Honourable Members during the budget debate.
6040,1990-91,In the light of these discussions the Government will take the final decision.
6041,1990-91,Domestic trade in gold is regulated under the Gold Control Act which was introduced in 1963 with the broad objective of curbing the demand for gold.
6042,1990-91,The Act has been largely ineffective.
6043,1990-91,It has also caused hardship and harassment to small goldsmiths.
6044,1990-91,There is not much point in continuing with such an ineffective legislation.
6045,1990-91,"The Government, therefore, proposes to abolish the Gold Control Act."
6046,1990-91,This step would benefit many artisans and small goldsmiths all over the country.
6047,1990-91,"At the same time, we will use the Customs Act more vigorously to prevent smuggling of gold."
6048,1990-91,Let me now turn to some issues of longterm development.
6049,1990-91,"In the traditional growth pattern, while the poor at the grass root level suffered in silence without much benefit of growth trickling down to them, the affluent at the. top lived in splendid isolation and monopolised most of the gains of economic growth."
6050,1990-91,The new Government rejects this trickle down theory of development.
6051,1990-91,"Instead, it would work for growth with equity ensured through employment oriented planning in which the decentralised institutions, of the four pillars state, aptly described by Dr. Ram Manohar Lohia as the ‘Choukhamba Raj’ will play a pivotal role."
6052,1990-91,"Our first priority is employment In the eighties, our economy grew at around 5 per cent or more."
6053,1990-91,"But, according to a recent report of the National Sample Survey the number of persons who are chronically unemployed increased from 8 million in 1983 to 12 million in 198788."
6054,1990-91,"In addition, there are a vast number who are underemployed and whose earnings from work fall well short of a decent minimum."
6055,1990-91,We believe that “every citizen has the right to productive and gainful work in order to live meaningfully and with dignity”.
6056,1990-91,We would like to introduce an Employment Guarantee Scheme.
6057,1990-91,"However, the cost of doing so in all parts of the country are huge, and we do not have the necessary resources at this juncture."
6058,1990-91,"Nevertheless, it is proposed to make a beginning on an Employment Guarantee Scheme for the drought prone areas and areas with an acute problem of rural unemployment The allocation for the 4 employment schemes of the Department of Rural Development will be supplemented, to the extent feasible, during the course of the year."
6059,1990-91,Faster growth of agriculture must be an important part of this strategy.
6060,1990-91,We have achieved impressive growth in yields in the areas of good irrigation but yields remain very low in large harts of the country which are rainfed or semiarid.
6061,1990-91,"Our strategy for agricultural development must focus on increasing output in these areas through greater investment in irrigation, land development, and soil and moisture conservation."
6062,1990-91,These investments will increase production.
6063,1990-91,They will also generate greater absorption of labour in agriculture.
6064,1990-91,"Parallel to this effort, regions of high productivity should aim at diversification of agriculture and development of agro based processing industries."
6065,1990-91,"This will provide the economic linkages between the rural economy and growing markets in urban areas, as well as potential markets abroad."
6066,1990-91,"The country had adopted an Industrial Policy Resolution in 1956, which through the years, has governed our broad strategy for industrial development."
6067,1990-91,It is surprising that there is no similar Agricultural Policy Resolution.
6068,1990-91,Ibis Government will remove this lacuna.
6069,1990-91,We will lay the basic foundations of agricultural development through the adoption of an Agricultural Policy Resolution.
6070,1990-91,This will represent our national commitment in respect of a sector which is the hub of our economy.
6071,1990-91,We invite all sections of the people to interact with the Government on the formulation of this Policy Resolution.
6072,1990-91,"We are committed to ensuring that 50 per cent of the investible resources are deployed for the development of agriculture and rural development We have made a beginning, in this year’s Central Plan in which the share of the rural sector in budgetary support for the Central Plan will go up from 44 per cent in 198990 to 49 per cent in 199091."
6073,1990-91,"In addition, on the nonPlan side we are providing Rs 1000 crores for debt relief, and Rs 4000 crores for the fertilizer subsidy, which also go to benefit rural areas."
6074,1990-91,The steps for the inclusion of the land reforms legislation in the Ninth Schedule of the Constitution have already been initiated and the necessary constitutional amendment will be introduced.
6075,1990-91,"Simultaneously, various measures for the restructuring of the land relations are being worked out"
6076,1990-91,"Over the years, poor farmers, artisans and weavers have accumulated debt which they are unable to repay."
6077,1990-91,They have been caught up in a vicious circle of indebtedness and low incomes which keeps them in perennial poverty.
6078,1990-91,"In order to relieve our farmers from the burden of debt, an assurance was given in the National Front’s manifesto that relief will be provided to farmers with loans upto Rs 10,000 as on 2nd October, 1989."
6079,1990-91,"I am glad to inform the House that we are now ‘ ready with the scheme of implementation of debt relief to fulfil the promise, and redeem the pledge given to the kisans and artisans."
6080,1990-91,It is proposed to introduce a scheme for providing debt relief which will have the following features.
6081,1990-91,The relief will be available to borrowers who have taken loans upto
6082,1990-91,"Rs 10,000 from public sector banks and Regional Rural Banks."
6083,1990-91,"The relief will cover all overdues as on 2nd October, 1989 including shortterm as well as term loans."
6084,1990-91,There will be no limit on the size of the borrower’s land holdings.
6085,1990-91,"However, wilful defaulters, who in the past did not repay loans despite their capacity to do so, will be excluded."
6086,1990-91,The Central Government will compensate the public sector banks and Regional Rural Banks suitably for the debts which are thus written off.
6087,1990-91,"Many of those who filed insolvency petitions and had taken loans below Rs 10,000 which were overdue as of 2nd October, 1989 will also be covered under the scheme."
6088,1990-91,The State Governments may also wish to introduce a scheme on the same lines in respect of cooperative banks within their purview.
6089,1990-91,"Subject to the constraint of resources, the Central Government will consider suggestions for helping State Governments in implementing a debt relief scheme on the same pattern in respect of cooperative credit institutions under their control."
6090,1990-91,"I consider the debt relief measure as a positive step which will enable our farmers, artisans and weavers to increase their productivity."
6091,1990-91,It is at the same time necessary to ensure that there is no erosion of the credibility of the banking system.
6092,1990-91,"Once the past overdues are cleared, it is reasonable to expect that loans taken for current operations will be serviced promptly."
6093,1990-91,"The Scheme should contribute to better agricultural recoveries and better identification of wilful defaulters, who do not deserve any sympathy."
6094,1990-91,Banks are being asked to set up a system of maintaining a proper credit history of their borrowers covered under the Scheme.
6095,1990-91,The Government would also like to make it clear that the Scheme will not be extended nor will it be repeated.
6096,1990-91,The Government proposes to introduce changes in the formula for computing costs of production of agricultural crops for price fixation so as to take full account of all costs.
6097,1990-91,"In particular the formula will take into account 1 valuation of labour including family labour on the basis of statutory minimum wage, or actual wage, whichever is higher, 2 the remuneration for the managerial and entrepreneurial efforts of the farmer, 3 adjustment of procurement/support prices for the escalation in input costs between the announcement of the prices and the arrival of the crop in the market."
6098,1990-91,The new formula will be reflected in the procurement support prices to be announced for the next kharif season.
6099,1990-91,"As procurement prices are revised in line with costs, the revision of issue prices is also unavoidable."
6100,1990-91,"In future, the Government will announce revision in procurement and issue prices at the same time even though these may take effect on different dates."
6101,1990-91,The threat to our environment can no more be ignored.
6102,1990-91,"It has been estimated that around 130 million hectares of land is degraded through soil erosion, salinity, total loss of tree cover, etc."
6103,1990-91,Our forests are under pressure from a variety of sources.
6104,1990-91,"In urban areas, air and water pollution from industry, transport and other sources is widespread."
6105,1990-91,A healthy environment is part of the quality of life and a productive environment is the basis for development.
6106,1990-91,Our emphasis on rural development and decentralisation will allow us to integrate environmental considerations into the design of development.
6107,1990-91,Let me now turn to another area of great concernthat of unemployed youth.
6108,1990-91,"All of us who travel in our constituencies have seen the plight of young people able and willing to work, but unable to find employment."
6109,1990-91,A longterm solution to this problem has to come from a shift to a more employmentoriented growth strategy.
6110,1990-91,But as an immediate step we have decided to give a boost to measures which will assist the youth of this country to acquire the skills that will improve their prospects for gainful employment.
6111,1990-91,A comprehensive Vocational Training Project has been taken up covering 28 States and Union Territories.
6112,1990-91,"The Project will improve the quality of craftsmen training, apprenticeship training and advanced training of industrial workers."
6113,1990-91,We also propose to link training and the provision of credit support for selfemployment.
6114,1990-91,Under the leadership of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar thousands belonging to the Scheduled Castes had embraced Buddhist religion in 1956 to seek liberation from caste oppression to which they were subjected for centuries.
6115,1990-91,"However, in the eyes of the orthodoxy the social stigma on the Scheduled Castes was not erased even after their conversion to Buddhism."
6116,1990-91,"It has, therefore, been decided by the Union Government that all the facilities and privileges that were available to the Scheduled Castes will be available to them from the Union Government even after their conversion to Buddhism."
6117,1990-91,"A strategy for greater absorption of labour in agriculture has to go hand in hand with faster growth of industry and balanced development of infrastructure, specially power and transport."
6118,1990-91,It is self evident that higher investment and faster growth in incomes in agriculture can be sustained only if industrial production increases to meet the rising demand for inputs and wage goods in particular.
6119,1990-91,This Government will give priority to accelerating industrial growth in a competitive and nonmonopolistic environment.
6120,1990-91,The Government will review and simplify the Industrial Licensing Policy to ensure that licensing does not become an instrument for preventing competition and perpetuating monopolies.
6121,1990-91,"The Khadi, Village and Small scale sector has a special role to play in any strategy for employmentoriented industrial development."
6122,1990-91,"We will work for the harmonious development of cottage, small and large industries and give protection against encroachment of large scale on small scale and small scale against cottage wherever necessary."
6123,1990-91,The withdrawal of the 15 per cent Central Investment Subsidy for Backward Areas has affected the growth of small scale industries.
6124,1990-91,We must take industry to the people and not people to the industry.
6125,1990-91,We propose to reintroduce a Central Investment Subsidy for small scale units in rural areas and backward regions.
6126,1990-91,A major problem faced by small industries is delay in the settlement of bills by large units.
6127,1990-91,The provision of factoring services in which the task of realisation of the bill is taken on by an intermediary is one way of mitigating this.
6128,1990-91,The House will be glad to know that some steps towards this end have already been taken by the Reserve Bank of India.
6129,1990-91,The problems of women entrepreneurs in the cottage and small sector are of particular concern to us.
6130,1990-91,The provisions regarding margin money and seed capital for women entrepreneurs will be reexamined and liberalised.
6131,1990-91,There is a single window scheme for grant of working capital along with term assistance to new projects in the small scale sector by State Financial Corporations.
6132,1990-91,This arrangement facilitates setting up of small scale units without waiting for finalisation of working capital limits from banks.
6133,1990-91,The present limits of project cost for determining eligibility for such composite loans is being raised from Rs 5 lakhs to Rs 10 lakhs.
6134,1990-91,Reserve Bank has issued guidelines for provision of credit and rehabilitation of viable small scale units.
6135,1990-91,"These guidelines, are intended to assist the small scale sector and not create hurdles in its path."
6136,1990-91,Banks are being asked to implement them faithfully.
6137,1990-91,The public sector is vital to our country’s development.
6138,1990-91,It has played a major role in broadening the base for industrial and technological development in this country.
6139,1990-91,The overall working results for the first six months of this financial year show a significant improvement in net profit from Rs 694 crores last year to Rs 1103 crores this year.
6140,1990-91,"In 199091, Central sector enterprises will finance 46 per cent of their plan investment from internal resources."
6141,1990-91,We are committed to making the public sector more efficient and resultoriented so that it can generate more surpluses which can be ploughed back for development.
6142,1990-91,The health of the public enterprises depends crucially on the commitment of its employees and their full participation in management.
6143,1990-91,It has been suggested that one way of securing this is to give workers a share in ownership either through stock option schemes or sale of shares to workers or to trusts owned by workers.
6144,1990-91,"Since the equity of public enterprises is not quoted in the market, arrangements will have to be worked out to determine the sale and purchase price of such worker’s shares."
6145,1990-91,I invite suggestions from Honourable Members on the merits of this idea and how it could be implemented.
6146,1990-91,"We are also firmly committed to the healthy development of capital markets, and to strengthen the role of public financial institutions."
6147,1990-91,The institutions will be given functional autonomy.
6148,1990-91,However they must also be accountable for their actions.
6149,1990-91,The institutions will not be party to corporate battles and clandestine takeovers.
6150,1990-91,The government would like to create an atmosphere and a culture where financial institutions can function objectively without fear or favour.
6151,1990-91,There has been some concern about the role of financial institutions in relation to their intervention in the capital market.
6152,1990-91,I have asked these institutions to frame suitable guidelines so that their actions are not only objective but seen to be so.
6153,1990-91,Each financial institution is expected to operate in the interest of its depositors and investors consistent with national priorities.
6154,1990-91,There may be occasions when there is an abnormal and persistent upward or downward movement in share prices because of concerted bull or bear pressures.
6155,1990-91,"In such situations, the financial institutions will play a stabilising role in the capital market."
6156,1990-91,The growth of banking since nationalisation has been phenomenal.
6157,1990-91,The banking system has been extended to the remotest part of our country.
6158,1990-91,Banks are now playing a vital role in mobilising peoples’ savings and channelling them into productive areas.
6159,1990-91,"At the time of nationalisation, only 14 per cent of the bank credit was provided for the priority sector covering sections, such as, agriculture, rural development and small industries and businesses."
6160,1990-91,"Today, this proportion is nearly 45 per cent."
6161,1990-91,This is the measure of the success of nationalisation.
6162,1990-91,There is one aspect of banking operations which is of concern to me.
6163,1990-91,This is the low credit deposit ratio in some regions.
6164,1990-91,A variety of factors determine this ratio.
6165,1990-91,I have asked the Reserve Bank of India to pay special attention to this problem and further improve credit delivery in such areas consistent with financial discipline.
6166,1990-91,"Our bank managers and employees are, as a group, the most qualified, dedicated and hard working."
6167,1990-91,But it is also a fact that the level of public satisfaction with the banking services is not as high as it should be.
6168,1990-91,"Over the years, perhaps some structural rigidities have crept in."
6169,1990-91,These need to be removed.
6170,1990-91,There is need for greater competition and greater operational flexibility in respect of banking services.
6171,1990-91,The banking culture has to be made more responsive to the needs of the public.
6172,1990-91,"I am requesting the Reserve Bank of India to set up a Committee of Bankers, bank employees, depositors and borrowers to consider these aspects and make recommendations to the Government."
6173,1990-91,The previous Government had announced the formation of the Securities Exchange Board of India SEBI in 1987.
6174,1990-91,Three years have passed and the legislation for giving statutory authority to SEBI has not been introduced.
6175,1990-91,We will ensure that this is done in this budget session.
6176,1990-91,Science and technology is the mainspring of development.
6177,1990-91,"We are proud of the capabilities that we have built up in critical areas like agriculture, space research, 9 atomic energy and defence."
6178,1990-91,"We will aim at utilising the talent of our scientists and engineers towards two basic ends: ,  the development of appropriate technologies for agriculture, non conventional and renewable energy and other employment intensive activities,  the establishment of a strong base of self reliance in critical areas of modern technology."
6179,1990-91,"Public spending on R & D, incentives for the use of indigenous technologies and policies to guide private research efforts will be oriented towards these objectives."
6180,1990-91,There is a large community of Indians settled abroad.
6181,1990-91,They have achieved tremendous success in their chosen professions and occupations.
6182,1990-91,"True to the rich tradition of our ancient culture, their physical location has not weakened the strong intellectual, philosophical and social links that they have with the country of their origin."
6183,1990-91,The Government will continue to provide special facilities for them to invest their savings in this country.
6184,1990-91,The procedures will be simplified so that they can function with a sense of confidence and in line with declared national policy.
6185,1990-91,Let me now turn to the Revised Estimates for 198990 and the Budget Estimates for 199091.
6186,1990-91,Revised Estimates for 198990 55.
6187,1990-91,Revised Estimates of Expenditure for the current year show an increase of Rs 5620 crores over the Budget Estimates.
6188,1990-91,"Of this, Rs 4958 crores are on nonPlan account and Rs 662 crores on Plan account."
6189,1990-91,Honourable Members are aware of the strains on our security environment which unfortunately coincide with the strains on our economy.
6190,1990-91,"Hence, on the non Plan side, Defence Services are being provided additional Rs 1500 crores to meet their essential requirements and committed expenditure."
6191,1990-91,"The provision for fertilizer subsidy will be Rs 950 brores more, mainly due to larger imports and clearance of arrear claims."
6192,1990-91,"There is an increase of Rs 276 crores in food subsidy, mainly for clearing arrears due to Food Corporation of India."
6193,1990-91,An additional provision of Rs 468 crores has been made for export promotion and market development.
6194,1990-91,Interest payments will be Rs 710 crores higher.
6195,1990-91,The Government is of the view that the amount of compensation to be paid to the victims of the Bhopal Gas tragedy under Court order is too meagre for the magnitude of sufferings of these innocent people.
6196,1990-91,"The matter is under review in Court and in the meantime Government have decided to pay interim relief for the victims for which a provision of Rs 320 crores has been made which, inclusive of bank interest over a period of 3 years, will amount to Rs 360 crores."
6197,1990-91,The increases are partly offset by savings in some areas notably in the lump sum provision made for dearness allowance consequent on transfer of liability on this account to the budget of the Ministries/Departments.
6198,1990-91,"On the Receipt side, while collection from Corporation Tax and Customs duties are expected to more or less reach Budget estimates, the receipts from Union excise duties are estimated to be Rs 599 crores less than the budget."
6199,1990-91,"Incometax collections, on the other hand, are expected to be more by Rs 755 crores."
6200,1990-91,"States’ share of taxes including the sums payable to States on the basis of collection figures certified by the C&AG for the earlier years are placed at Rs 13232 crores against Rs 12438 crores at the budget stage, i.e. Rs 794 crores more."
6201,1990-91,"The shortfall in net revenue receipts is expected to be more than off set by larger receipts from small savings, provident fund collections and special deposits of nongovernment provident funds, etc. 58."
6202,1990-91,The overall deficit for the current year is now estimated at Rs 11750 crores against the budget estimate of Rs 7337 crores.
6203,1990-91,Budget Estimates for 199091 59.
6204,1990-91,The next financial year is the beginning of the Eighth Five Year Plan.
6205,1990-91,"This Government is irrevocably committed to planned economic development, and to making the plan more meaningful to the people."
6206,1990-91,"As a part of the new strategy, in the next year’s Plan, we have provided more for those programmes and schemes which benefit the people directly."
6207,1990-91,"We have favoured those programmes that create more jobs, generate selfemployment opportunities, improve the living environment in our villages and strengthen our agriculture."
6208,1990-91,This is the surest route to overcome poverty.
6209,1990-91,"An increase of 31.7 per cent on last year’s budget estimate is being provided for Agriculture and Allied Services, without taking into account the budget provision of Rs 1000 crores for the debt relief for farmers, weavers and artisans."
6210,1990-91,"The allocation for antipoverty programmes, which are spread over different budget heads is being increased by about 23 per cent over last year’s budget estimate."
6211,1990-91,This includes the outlay for employment programmes in rural and urban areas which is being increased by 30 per cent on last year’s budget estimate.
6212,1990-91,We have a firm commitment to accord highest priority to agriculture and rural development and our thrust and actions are in conformity with that commitment.
6213,1990-91,"For the Central Plan 199091, I propose an outlay of Rs 39,329 crores  an increase of Rs 4,883 crores or 14.2 per cent over the current year’s outlay."
6214,1990-91,"Of this, Rs 17,344 crores will be provided as budgetary support and the balance of Rs 21,985 crores will be mobilised by the public sector enterprises through their internal resources as well as borrowings."
6215,1990-91,"For the year 199091, an outlay of Rs 905 crores is proposed for the Department of Agriculture and Cooperation which represents an increase of 17.5 per cent over the budget estimates for the current year."
6216,1990-91,"In addition, I am also proposing an outlay of Rs 155 crores for agricultural Research and Education compared to the provision of Rs 110 crores in 198990  an increase of 41 per cent."
6217,1990-91,I have already referred to the intention of the Government to make a beginning in respect of an Employment Guarantee Scheme.
6218,1990-91,"The Annual Plan outlay proposed for the Department of Rural Development is Rs 3,115 crores."
6219,1990-91,"It is my intention to provide some additional funds, within the constraint of resources, to enable an Employment Guarantee Scheme to be introduced in selected areas."
6220,1990-91,"The Government is pledged to securing a fair deal for the most oppressed, exploited and deprived sectors of the society, namely, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."
6221,1990-91,It is proposed to make a provision of Rs 320 crores for the schemes for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in the Annual Plan 199091 as against Rs 269 crores in 198990 BE.
6222,1990-91,The Special Central Assistance to Special Component Plans and Tribal SubPlans of States has also been increased.
6223,1990-91,The Government would intensify the efforts for eradication of illiteracy.
6224,1990-91,The very fact that millions of voters in the country have to identify the names of candidates on the ballot papers only from the election symbols is itself a symbol of the extent of illiteracy.
6225,1990-91,We have made 25 per cent increase in allocation for National Literacy Mission.
6226,1990-91,Special attention to vocational programmes at all levels will be given.
6227,1990-91,"The process of modernisation of technical education, and support to thrust and frontier areas in science and technology will be maintained."
6228,1990-91,I am proposing an outlay of Rs 865 crores for the Department of Education during 199091.
6229,1990-91,"In all the programmes of health and family welfare services, special attention will be paid to the needs of the rural people."
6230,1990-91,I am proposing an outlay of Rs 950 crores for the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare for 199091 67.
6231,1990-91,"The Government attaches great significance to the welfare of the weak, the poor and the deprived living in the urban areas."
6232,1990-91,"Major initiatives for employment, low cost sanitation for liberation of scavengers and provision for night shelters are proposed to be launched."
6233,1990-91,The plan outlay of the Urban Development Sector is being increased to Rs 272 crores in 199091 from Rs 89 crores in 198990BE for this purpose.
6234,1990-91,The Annual Plan outlays for 199091 for the infrastructure sectors are proposed to be stepped up.
6235,1990-91,"The outlays for Petroleum and Natural Gas is proposed to be increased by 18.6 per cent, Railways by 12.4 per tent and Power by about 10 percent."
6236,1990-91,The details regarding Central Plan outlays for these and other sectors are in the Budget documents.
6237,1990-91,"I do not wish to take the time of the House in making my speech a substitute for thevoluminous budget documents, and thus deprive the Members of the excitement of reading these documents’."
6238,1990-91,"Honourable Members will be happy to know that the Central assistance for State and UT Plans next year will be Rs 12,848 crores, including the Plan revenue grants recommended by the Finance Commission as against Rs 10,450 crores excluding drought assistance provided in Budget Estimates for the current year."
6239,1990-91,Ibis represents a substantial step up of 22.9 per cent.
6240,1990-91,"Budget Estimates for the next year provide Rs 64,515 crores for nonPlan expenditure as against Rs 59,220 crores in Revised Estimates for the current year."
6241,1990-91,"The main increase next year is under interest payments provision for which goes up from Rs 17,710 crores this year to Rs 20,850 crores next year."
6242,1990-91,The Government have appointed a Committee to consider the issue of One Rank One Pension in all its aspects.
6243,1990-91,"The Report of the Committee is expected by end of March, 1990 and government will take further action thereafter."
6244,1990-91,"For Defence Services, a provision of Rs 15,750 crores has been made in the Budget Estimates."
6245,1990-91,This increase in the defence expenditure is not of our choice.
6246,1990-91,It is the direct result of the situation on our borders.
6247,1990-91,Freedom struggle is indivisible and therefore it has been decided that those who fought for Goa’s liberation from the Portugese rule will be eligible for Union Government’s pension and all other benefits available to other freedom fighters.
6248,1990-91,"The Ninth Finance Commission has submitted its second report covering the period 199095, a copy of which was laid on the Table of the House last week along with a statement of decisions of Government on the recommendations."
6249,1990-91,These have been taken into account while framing the Budget for next year.
6250,1990-91,The recommendations of the Finance Commission accepted by Government will cast an additional burden of the order of Rs 773 crores on the Central Budget in 199091.
6251,1990-91,Government are alive to the important issue of checking proliferation of Government expenditure especially in nonpriority and nondevelopmental areas.
6252,1990-91,I am requesting all the Ministries and Departments to absorb the liabilites on account of additional instalments of D.A. which will be payable next year from within the budget provisions made for them by effecting economics and eliminating nonessential expenditure.
6253,1990-91,"I am, therefore, including only a nominal provision of Rs 100 crores in the next year’s budget as lump sum provision for D.A."
6254,1990-91,This is mainly to meet the possible requirements of small Departments with limited budgets who may not find it possible to absorb D.A. increases to the full extent.
6255,1990-91,"On the Receipts side, Gross Tax Revenue at the 198990 rate of taxation is estimated at Rs 57988 crores and the net tax revenue after payment to States of their share of taxes is placed at Rs 43507 compared to Rs 37798 crores in the Revised Estimates for die current year."
6256,1990-91,"I have taken a credit of Rs 8000 crores on account of market borrowings as against Rs 7,400 crores in the current year."
6257,1990-91,External assistance net of repayment is expected to be of the order of Rs 4327 crores in the next year as against Rs 3901 crores in the current year.
6258,1990-91,Taking into account the other variations in receipts and expenditure the overall deficit for next year at the 198990 rate of taxation is estimated at Rs 9165 crores.
6259,1990-91,"Having taxed your patience so far, now let me turn to other areas of taxation and reliefs for which you must have been waiting impatiently."
6260,1990-91,Let me begin with my proposals in respect of direct taxes.
6261,1990-91,"I am introducing certain major changes in the rate structure for personal incometax with a view to providing relief to low and middle income groups, and to make the savings linked incentives more equitable for taxpayers in different income slabs."
6262,1990-91,My first proposal to raise the exemption limit is in fulfilment of a promise made in the National Front manifesto.
6263,1990-91,"I am raising the exemption limit for personal income taxation from Rs 18,000 to Rs 22,000."
6264,1990-91,"Roughly, one million persons will go out of the tax net as a result of this change."
6265,1990-91,"In deciding the new limit, I have had to balance two conflicting considerations."
6266,1990-91,"On the one hand, it is a fact that the lower income groups have been affected the most by price rise, and there is a case to raise the exemption limit."
6267,1990-91,"On the other hand, an increase in the limit narrows the tax base and involves substantial loss of revenue as the benefit of the increase is spread over all taxpayers, and is not confined to the lower end of the income levels."
6268,1990-91,"Experts have often argued that keeping in view our per capita income, raising of the exemption limit is not justified."
6269,1990-91,"However, as I temperamentally prefer to avoid taking extreme positions, I have chosen the middle course which I believe is fair and reasonable."
6270,1990-91,"As further measure of relief to the lower and middle income groups, I am extending the lowest rate of 20% from the present limit of Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000. 81."
6271,1990-91,"Last year, a surcharge at the rate of 8 per cent was introduced for financing employment programmes."
6272,1990-91,Dropping this employment surcharge would have brought into question my irrevocable commitment to employment oriented planning.
6273,1990-91,"I, therefore, have no choice but to continue this surcharge."
6274,1990-91,"This will now be applicable beyond taxable income of Rs 75,000 as against the present limit of Rs 50,000."
6275,1990-91,"As the Honourable Members are aware, the existing schemes of tax incentive to promote savings are based on deductions from income."
6276,1990-91,A person gets tax relief at the highest marginal rate of tax applicable to him.
6277,1990-91,"Accordingly, it confers higher amount of tax benefit to a person with higher income visavis a person with a lower income."
6278,1990-91,"With a view to removing this inequity, I propose to introduce a system of tax rebate on the gross amount of savings under section 80C."
6279,1990-91,"Under the new system, a person contributing to provident fund, life insurance, National Savings Certificates, etc. as earlier, will now be entitled to a tax rebate calculated at the rate of 20%, on such savings."
6280,1990-91,"The maximum tax rebate allowable will be Rs 10,000 generally and Rs 14,000 in the case of authors, playwrights, artists, musicians, actors, sportsmen and athletes."
6281,1990-91,This is broadly equivalent to she maximum relief available now.
6282,1990-91,"All persons will get the same amount of tax benefit on a given amount of savings, irrespective of their levels of income."
6283,1990-91,The low income taxpayer will benefit.
6284,1990-91,Let me illustrate the impact of the above proposals.
6285,1990-91,"A person with a salary income of Rs 3,500 per month, i.e. Rs 42,000 per year, who saves Rs 8,000 per year in provident fund and insurance presently pays Rs 1,000 per year as tax."
6286,1990-91,"Under the new dispensation, he will not have to pay any tax at all."
6287,1990-91,"The upper income group will have to save Rs 50,000 to get the full relief of Rs 10,000."
6288,1990-91,"Under the old system they would have got the same relief by saving only Rs 39,500."
6289,1990-91,"I may mention in passing, that the new system of a uniform tax rebate will also lead to a substantial simplification in tax deduction at source by employers."
6290,1990-91,"As a further incentive to save, I propose to increase the limit available for the savings incentives under section 80CCA from Rs 30,000 to Rs 40,000."
6291,1990-91,"Since the savings under this are on a ‘netting’ principle and are added back to income when withdrawn, the present system of deduction from taxable income will continue."
6292,1990-91,"In addition to this, the Equity Linked Savings Scheme ELSS announced last year has how been finalised on a ‘netting’ principle."
6293,1990-91,"Investment in units under the Scheme, will be eligible for deduction upto"
6294,1990-91,The annual return on the investment in the units will be eligible for tax concession under section 80L.
6295,1990-91,"On repurchase of the units by the Mutual Funds, the capital amount representing the cost of the units win be taxed as income in the year of repurchase and the excess will be liable to tax as capital gains."
6296,1990-91,The Equity Linked Savings Scheme will eventually replace the present deduction under section 80CC.
6297,1990-91,"Meanwhile, this provision is being extended for investments made upto 31st March, 1991."
6298,1990-91,"In an effort to mitigate in some small measure, the hardship of parents or guardians of physically handicapped or mentally retarded persons with incomes upto Rupees sixty thousand per annum, I propose allowing a deduction of Rs 6,000 from the parent’s or guardian’s total income to cover expenses on medical treatment, training and rehabilitation of such persons."
6299,1990-91,"I propose to increase the deduction in respect of professional income from foreign sources, available to authors, playwrights, artists, musicians, actors and sportsmen including athletes, from the existing rate of 25% to 50% of the income, or 75% of the foreign exchange brought into India, whichever is higher."
6300,1990-91,"In the case of professors, teachers and research workers also, the present provision has been liberalised to allow deduction of 75% of the foreign exchange brought into India."
6301,1990-91,I will now make my proposals in regard to corporate taxation.
6302,1990-91,The corporate sector has often claimed that the rate of Corporate Tax is high and that this inhibits growth as well as tax compliance.
6303,1990-91,"On closer scrutiny, I find that the rate is only seemingly high, because the system provides too many exemptions."
6304,1990-91,"After all the admissible exemptions and deductions, the effective rate falls drastically."
6305,1990-91,Many large and high profit making companies had been able to escape the tax net and were paying zero tax for a long time.
6306,1990-91,That is why the contribution of the corporate sector to tax 15 revenue was not commensurate with the profits they earned; nor with the needs of national development.
6307,1990-91,The tax system also tilted the balance in favour of capital intensive production.
6308,1990-91,"To ensure better tax compliance, I propose a twin strategy."
6309,1990-91,"I am abolishing major incentives like Investment Allowance and Investment Deposit Account with a view to closing the escape route for the corporate sector to go out of the tax net; and having closed that route, I propose to fix the tax rate for widely held domestic companies at 40% with corresponding changes in rates for other domestic companies."
6310,1990-91,This twin strategy will raise the effective tax rate and will also give substantial additional revenue of Rs 800 crores.
6311,1990-91,The only major deductions that will now be permitted are those relating to foreign exchange earnings and for setting up new industrial undertakings.
6312,1990-91,The deduction for setting up new industries is being raised from 25 per cent to 30 per cent in the case of companies and from 20 per cent to 25 per cent for others.
6313,1990-91,The period during which the benefit can be availed of is being extended from 8 to 10 yew.
6314,1990-91,"With the abolition of the major exemptions, there is a case for also removing the special provision regarding tax on minimum profits contained in section 115 of the Incometax Act."
6315,1990-91,"Accordingly, I propose to discontinue that provision with effect from the assessment year 199192."
6316,1990-91,I am also introducing an important change in the taxation of intercorporate dividends.
6317,1990-91,At present 60% of the dividend income received by a domestic company from another is exempt from tax.
6318,1990-91,There is a tendency towards holding of personal wealth in the form of companies which are in effect closelyheld.
6319,1990-91,"In order to encourage genuine investment activity while at the same time discouraging the use of corporate framework for holding personal wealth, I propose to exempt dividends received by domestic companies from other domestic companies to the full extent to which they themselves declare dividends during the relevant period."
6320,1990-91,"However, scheduled banks and public financial institutions would, in substance, continue to be governed by the provisions of section 80M as they presently stand."
6321,1990-91,"The result of the reform of the corporate tax system proposed by me will be to increase the buoyancy, simplify the tax structure and make it neutral as between small and large companies."
6322,1990-91,"At the same time, it will provide strong incentive for export and for investment in new industrial undertakings."
6323,1990-91,Many small scale industries are organised as partnerships.
6324,1990-91,"I propose to raise their exemption limit from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 and to lower the tax rates suitably."
6325,1990-91,"Restoration of ecologically degraded areas fulfils the objectives of employment generation, enhances the supply of fuel wood and fodder and also contributes to the overall social, economic and environmental stability of the rural 16 areas."
6326,1990-91,"In order to promote afforestation, I propose to extend the provisions of section 35CCB and section 80GGA to taxpayers who contribute to a fund or programme for afforestation approved by the prescribed authority."
6327,1990-91,As in the case of personal income tax.
6328,1990-91,"I propose to continue the existing surcharge of 8% on corporate taxpayers also on all incomes above Rs 75,000. 97."
6329,1990-91,I also propose to make a major change in the taxation of gifts.
6330,1990-91,"At present, gifts are taxed in the hands of the donor, but there is no limit on the amount which a donee can show as having been received by way of gifts."
6331,1990-91,"Because of this, the mechanism of gifts is used to split up capital and launder black money."
6332,1990-91,Some instances have also come to notice recently where attempts have been made to explain away wasteful and ostentatious expenditure on marriage receptions and other functions as having been financed out of gifts.
6333,1990-91,"With a view to curbing such practices, I have decided to substitute the present gifttax on donors with a donee based gifttax."
6334,1990-91,"Any person, who claims his assets or his expenditures as having been financed from gifts, will now be liable to a gifttax on a graduated scale."
6335,1990-91,Thus he will have the pleasure of transferring a part of his bounty as a gift to the exchequer.
6336,1990-91,The primary purpose of the doneebased gifttax is not to raise revenue but to check tax evasion and conspicuous consumption.
6337,1990-91,"In order to take care of legitimate gifts, there will be a basic exemption limit of Rs 20,000 per year."
6338,1990-91,"In the case of total gifts exceeding Rs 20,000 but not exceeding Rs 50,000, gifttax will be levied at 20 per cent; for total gifts exceeding Rs 50,000 but not exceeding Rs 2,00,000 at 30 per cent; and for total gifts exceeding Rs 2,00,000 at 40 per cent."
6339,1990-91,"In addition, I also propose to allow for a substantially higher limit of rupees one lakh for gifts received from all sources by an individual at the time of marriage."
6340,1990-91,"Further, gifts received in foreign exchange through official channels will also be exempt."
6341,1990-91,"I propose to make the new system applicable in respect of gifts made on or after 20th March, 1990."
6342,1990-91,"Consequently, the existing GiftTax Act taxing the gifts in the hands of donors will cease to be operative in respect of gifts made on or after that date."
6343,1990-91,Legislation to give effect to this new scheme is proposed to be introduced during the current session of Parliament.
6344,1990-91,I do not propose to take up the time of the House with other minor changes in the Direct Tax Laws.
6345,1990-91,"As I mentioned earlier, there will be a gain in revenue from corporate tax to the extent of Rs 800 crores."
6346,1990-91,The loss in revenue from incometax other than corporate tax after providing for better compliance is expected to be Rs 250 crores.
6347,1990-91,"There will, therefore, be an additional accrual of Rs 550 crores in respect of direct taxes."
6348,1990-91,"Sir, I shall now deal with my proposals relating to indirect taxes."
6349,1990-91,The main thrust of the proposals is on simplification and rationalisation.
6350,1990-91,"Simultaneously, I have also attempted to mobilise some resources in a manner dud does not hurt the common man and at the same time helps to curb elitist consumption."
6351,1990-91,A major emphasis has been on strengthening impulses for growth and exports.
6352,1990-91,Significant changes in duty structure are also proposed to develop a quality culture in our industry.
6353,1990-91,"I have also not failed to give relief to the deserving sectors, particularly small scale industry, agriculture and environmental protection."
6354,1990-91,All these measures have been described in some detail in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Finance Bill and I shall deal briefly with the more important of these proposals.
6355,1990-91,"Presently, the import duty rates are widely dispersed."
6356,1990-91,"With a view to rationalising the rates and bringing down their multiplicity, the total of the basic and auxiliary duty rates of customs are being placed in a limited number of slots in the range of zero to 125% in respect of most items."
6357,1990-91,"Further, as a step towards rationalisation and simplification of the Central Excise Tariff, the duty rates are proposed to be recast for a large number of goods."
6358,1990-91,"Though as a result of the rationalisation, the duty rates on certain commodities may marginally go up or down, the proposals on the whole are intended to be broadly revenue neutral."
6359,1990-91,The reduction in 6e number of rates in each Chapter of the Tariff will simplify assessment.
6360,1990-91,It will be our endeavour to ensure a measure of stability for the ad valorem rates.
6361,1990-91,"First, I shall take up the proposals which are in the nature of concessions in customs and excise duties."
6362,1990-91,Agriculture is a priority area in our framework of development and tax rates are already kept low on most of the inputs used in this sector.
6363,1990-91,Specified pesticides and pesticide intermediates enjoy concessional rates of import duty of 70% and 60% respectively.
6364,1990-91,I propose to reduce the import duty on a few more specified bulk pesticides and pesticide intermediates to these levels.
6365,1990-91,The proposal involves a revenue loss of about Rs 16 crores.
6366,1990-91,"In order to encourage the use of rapeseed oil and mustard oil, of which there is an abundant production in the country, I propose to completely exempt refined rapeseed oil and mustard oil which are currently attracting excise duty of Rs 750 per tonne."
6367,1990-91,The revenue loss on account of this proposal is estimated to be Rs 8 crores.
6368,1990-91,I propose to remove excise duty on pickles altogether in the hope that this will lend some flavour and spice to my budget.
6369,1990-91,Excise duty on coffee is presently levied at the rates of Rs 78 and Rs 105 per quintal depending upon the variety.
6370,1990-91,"As a measure of relief to the coffee growers, I propose to reduce the duty to a uniform level of Rs 50 per quintal."
6371,1990-91,This concession involves a revenue loss of Rs 4 crores.
6372,1990-91,Marine products constitute a major thrust area of the country’s exports.
6373,1990-91,"In order to make imported prawn feed more economical, I propose to reduce the duty on this item to 25%."
6374,1990-91,"In order to help modernisation of food processing and sea food industries, I propose to extend the concessional rate of import duty of 40% now available to certain specified machinery, to a few more items."
6375,1990-91,"With a view to reducing the cost of cattle feed, I propose to completely exempt molasses used in its manufacture from the whole of excise duty."
6376,1990-91,I also propose to prescribe concessional import duty of 40% in respect of certain items of equipment required in cattle breeding and dairying.
6377,1990-91,I propose to exempt fully footvalves of certain specifications from excise duty in order to promote efficiency of agricultural pumps.
6378,1990-91,"Presently, kraft paper and kraft paperboard used for apple packaging in Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir and Uttar Pradesh are exempted from excise duty, as a measure to conserve forest wealth."
6379,1990-91,I propose to extend this concession to packaging of all horticulture produce all over the country.
6380,1990-91,This is expected to result in a revenue loss of Rs 5 crores.
6381,1990-91,I propose to extend M11 exemption from excise duty to hand made paper and paper board manufactured by units of Khadi and Village Industries Commission even when power is used in the process of sheet forming.
6382,1990-91,I also propose to enhance the value limit for the purposes of excise duty exemption on footwear from Rs 75 to Rs 100 per pair in respect of such footwear made by units under KVIC as well as those run with the assistance of IRDP.
6383,1990-91,"In addition to the measures outlined in the earlier part of my speech for the promotion of small scale sector, I also propose to extend some more fiscal concessions to this sector."
6384,1990-91,"Presently, small scale units are allowed complete exemption from excise duty in respect of clearance of goods upto a value of Rs 15 lakhs in case such goods fall under only one Chapter of the Central Excise Tariff."
6385,1990-91,I propose to increase this value limit to Rs 20 lakhs.
6386,1990-91,"The total exemption available to goods cleared upto a value limit of Rs 30 lakhs, when such goods fall under more than one Chapter of the Tariff, will remain unchanged."
6387,1990-91,The increase in exemption limit for small scale units involves a revenue loss of Rs 67 crores.
6388,1990-91,"The scheme of notional credit of 5% in the case of inputs manufactured in the small scale sector is also being continued for one more year from the Ist April, 1990."
6389,1990-91,"Further, the limit of value of clearance of goods in a financial year for the purpose of obtaining a central excise licence is being increased from the existing level of Rs 10 lakhs to Rs 15 lakhs."
6390,1990-91,"It has also been decided that the licensed small scale units having value of clearances upto Rs 20 lakhs in a year will henceforth be required to furnish only quarterly returns of production, clearance and duty payment."
6391,1990-91,"These changes are proposed to take effect from the lst April, 1990."
6392,1990-91,"In order to reduce the prices of life saving drugs, I propose to exempt certain finished formulations containing Rifampicin, which is an antiTB drug, from central excise duty."
6393,1990-91,Specified bulk drugs which are required for the manufacture of certain fife saving medicines are also being exempted from customs duty.
6394,1990-91,I propose to reduce the import duty on certain specified drug intermediates to 90%.
6395,1990-91,These proposals involve a loss of revenue of nearly Rs 17 crores.
6396,1990-91,We are all aware of some recent tragedies involving unhygenically packed intravenous fluids.
6397,1990-91,"In order that the pharmaceutical industry is encouraged to employ latest techniques of aseptic packaging, I propose to reduce the import duty on aseptic form fill seal machines for use by that industry from the present level of 147.25% to 40%."
6398,1990-91,Certain life saving equipments are eligible for complete exemption from import duty.
6399,1990-91,I propose to extend this benefit to certain specified instruments and implants for physically handicapped persons.
6400,1990-91,I also propose to give some concessions in customs duty to components of hearing aids.
6401,1990-91,I propose to reduce the import duty on homeopathic medicines as well as on certain inputs for the manufacture of such medicines.
6402,1990-91,This involves a revenue loss of about Rs 5 crores.
6403,1990-91,"With a view to giving an impetus to industrial production and to boost exports, I propose to grant some concessions to capital goods and machinery."
6404,1990-91,There has been a feelingthat our exports are not able to face international competition due to high cost of imported capital equipment.
6405,1990-91,A scheme is being worked out for making available to registered manufacturerexporters the facility of import of capital goods at concessional rate of duty against suitable export obligation.
6406,1990-91,"Broadly, capital goods upto a specified value limit imported under the scheme would be eligible to a concessional import duty of 25%."
6407,1990-91,This will be subject to the condition that goods of a minimum of three times the value of the imported capital goods are exported within four years from the date of importation.
6408,1990-91,Concessional import duties have been prescribed from time to time on machinery required for various export thrust sectors.
6409,1990-91,I propose to extend the concession to specified items of machinery for rubber belting industry and forged hand tool industry.
6410,1990-91,The concession involves a revenue loss of Rs 8 crores.
6411,1990-91,"In order to promote investment and strengthen indigenous capital goods sector, I propose to reduce the excise duty on such machinery on a selective basis by 5 percentage points."
6412,1990-91,This concession will lead to loss of revenue to the extent of Rs 60 crores.
6413,1990-91,I am one of those who believe that the indigenous capital goods sector is integral to our search for selfreliance.
6414,1990-91,"With a view to encouraging industrial units to invest in quality upgradation and strengthen quality control, I propose to prescribe a concessional import duty of 40% on specified instruments and equipments."
6415,1990-91,The proposal involves a revenue loss of Rs 30 crores.
6416,1990-91,Ibis substantial revenue loss is worthwhile in the interest of improving the quality of indigenous products.
6417,1990-91,In the interest of better environmental protection and pollution control.
6418,1990-91,I propose to extend the present concessional customs duty of 40% to some more specified air and water pollution control equipments.
6419,1990-91,"At the same time, I propose to reduce the excise duty on certain specified pollution control equipments from 15% to 5%."
6420,1990-91,Heavy investments are required for the upgradation of the facilities available at the airports.
6421,1990-91,"I propose, as a measure of relief, to reduce the import duty on navigational, communication, air traffic control and landing equipments imported by the National Airports Authority of India to a level of 25%."
6422,1990-91,The proposal involves a revenue loss of Rs 7.5 crores.
6423,1990-91,"In order, to promote establishment of telecommunication network in rural areas, I propose to reduce the excise duty on specified telecommunication equipment from the existing rate of 20% to 15%."
6424,1990-91,This will lead to a revenue loss of Rs 15 crores.
6425,1990-91,I propose to reduce the excise duty on dry cell batteries from 35% to 30%.
6426,1990-91,The relief will involve a revenue loss of Rs 10 crores.
6427,1990-91,It has been represented that film industry is facing difficulties on account of video piracy.
6428,1990-91,"In order to help combat this menace by simultaneous release of prints in a number of cinema houses, I propose to fully exempt feature films from excise duty."
6429,1990-91,The proposal would involve a revenue loss of Rs 8 crores.
6430,1990-91,"I hope, with this incentive, the films which had gone into slow motion will regain their lost momentum."
6431,1990-91,"In order to give relief to the newspaper industry, I propose to reduce the import duty on standard newsprint by Rs 100 per tonne."
6432,1990-91,"As a matter of administrative simplification, I propose to shift the incidence of excise duty from truck body building activity, which is mostly in the unorganised sector, to motor vehicle chassis."
6433,1990-91,Now I move on to a package of proposals relating to the textile industry.
6434,1990-91,"These aim mainly at simplifying and rationalising the tariff structure, minimising the scope for evasion and ensuring a lower rate of duty for most varieties of cheaper fabrics."
6435,1990-91,There are essentially two sets of proposals.
6436,1990-91,"The first relates to duty rationalisation at the fabric stage and the second, to changes in excise and import duties on manmade fibres and yarns as well as the intermediates used to produce them."
6437,1990-91,There is a growing concern about the plight of the handloom weaver.
6438,1990-91,It is widely believed that one of the main causes of the distress is the neutralisation of the 21 tax concessions given to this sector by widespread tax evasion at the processing stage.
6439,1990-91,"There is thus a near unanimous view in favour of transferring the excise duty from fabrics to yam, which I share."
6440,1990-91,"However, in the case of manmade fabric, the entire duty is by way of additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax."
6441,1990-91,"Therefore, any change in the duty structure can be made only in consultation with the States."
6442,1990-91,I propose to consult the Chief Ministers shortly in this regard.
6443,1990-91,"A part of the duty on cotton fabrics is, however, in the shape of basic excise duty."
6444,1990-91,"As a first step, I propose to transfer the whole of the basic duty on cotton fabrics to yarn."
6445,1990-91,"As the hank yarn used by handlooms will continue to be exempted, the price differential between hank yarn and cone yarn would be widened and this should greatly improve the competitiveness of the handloom sector."
6446,1990-91,"Since at present the additional excise duty at the processing stage cannot be shifted to yarn without consultation with the States, I have attempted to rationalise the duty structure on fabrics."
6447,1990-91,The number of slabs in the case of manmade fabrics is being reduced in a manner that the duty on fabrics becomes more equitable and the administration of tax laws more efficient.
6448,1990-91,"The rationalisation will also, I believe, greatly reduce evasion and consequently improve realisation."
6449,1990-91,"Let me turn to manmade fibres, yams and the intermediates used to produce them."
6450,1990-91,Honourable members will recall that duties were reduced substantially on man made textiles in 1985 and 1988.
6451,1990-91,"While the incidence of taxes was lowered, there have been complaints that the consumer did not get the corresponding benefit I have thus tried to revise die duty structure keeping in mind the ability of different sectors to bear the additional burden."
6452,1990-91,This will also help the competitiveness of the handloom sector where the dominant fibre is cotton.
6453,1990-91,The major changes I am proposing are:  imposition of a basic excise duty of Rs 4.40 per kg.
6454,1990-91,"In order to ensure a measure of price discipline in this industry, I propose to reduce import duties,  on DMT and PTA from 195% to 150%, 22  on NFY from 130% to 100%,  on PFY from 205% to 180% and  on VSF from 55% to 40%."
6455,1990-91,The revenue loss from these duty reductions will be marginal since actual imports am not expected to be significant.
6456,1990-91,"Keeping in view the sharp decline in the international price of MEG, I propose to raise the import duty on this item from 90% to 150%."
6457,1990-91,This will result in an additional revenue of nearly Rs 48 crores.
6458,1990-91,"Honourable Members may recall that for providing cheap cloth to the weaker sections of the society and to encourage the development of the handloom sector, additional excise duty under Textiles and Textile Articles Act was levied in 1978."
6459,1990-91,The present rate of this duty is generally 13.64% of the basic excise duty.
6460,1990-91,"In addition to this duty, a cess at the rate of 2.5 paise per square metre is levied on fabrics for the purpose of developing khadi and other handloom industries."
6461,1990-91,I propose to merge both these levies by raising the additional duty from 13.64% to 15% of the basic excise duty.
6462,1990-91,"There are certain other rationalisation measures relating to textiles including marginal adjustment of duty rates on acrylic fibre, polypropylene staple fibre and filament yarn etc., without significant revenue implications."
6463,1990-91,The jute industry needs encouragement for diversification of its products.
6464,1990-91,"I propose to fully exempt jute blankets, floor coverings, mattings and bleached, printed and dyed jute fabrics from excise duty."
6465,1990-91,Full exemption available to jute yam supplied to KVIC units is also being extended to the handicraft sector.
6466,1990-91,"I hope, having relished so far the liberal reliefs, the Honourable Members will not now grudge some revenue earning measures."
6467,1990-91,"The family members of my smoker friends would, I am sure, be expecting an increase in the rates of excise duty on cigarettes in the interest of the health of the smokers."
6468,1990-91,I will not disappoint them.
6469,1990-91,The increase in duty will be 15 paise for the cheaper cigarettes and 75 paise in the case of costlier cigarettes per packet of ten.
6470,1990-91,There will be no change in the duty rate on nonfilter cigarettes of length upto
6471,1990-91,This measure is estimated to yield additional excise revenue of Rs 131 crores.
6472,1990-91,I shall be more than happy if my actual collections are much less due to fall in cigarette consumption.
6473,1990-91,Some sympathetic increase in the excise duty rates on pan masala is also being made to yield additional revenue of Rs 6 crores.
6474,1990-91,"I propose to increase the excise duty on cocoa and cocoa preparations from 10% to 15%, on jams, marmalades etc."
6475,1990-91,The revenue gain from these measures will be of the order of Rs 26 crores.
6476,1990-91,The House will agree that items used by the affluent sections of the society must bear a higher burden of levies.
6477,1990-91,"I propose to increase the excise duty on certain items like microwave oven, washing machine, certain sophisticated varieties of audio systems, video cassette recorder and player, electronic games and relatively high priced cooking ranges."
6478,1990-91,I propose to increase the excise duty on motor cars from 35% to 40%.
6479,1990-91,This measure will yield additional revenue to the tune of Rs 79 crores.
6480,1990-91,I do not propose to make any change in the excise duty on two wheelers and tractors.
6481,1990-91,"The specific duty rates of excise on refrigerators, airconditioners of capacity upto 1.5 tonnes and automotive gas compressors are being increased."
6482,1990-91,I propose to enhance the excise duty on car airconditioning parts including those forming the kit from 40% to 65%.
6483,1990-91,These proposals involve a revenue gain of Rs 14 crores.
6484,1990-91,"Tyres and tubes, except for a few varieties, are currently subject to central excise levy at specific rates."
6485,1990-91,"On these items, owing to recurring increase in prices, the duty incidence in ad valorem terms has come down."
6486,1990-91,"As a corrective measure, I propose to raise the existing specific rates on tyres and tubes."
6487,1990-91,"However, I do not propose any increase of duty on tractor, trailer and two wheeler tyres and tubes."
6488,1990-91,"This, along with certain other rationalisation measures, is likely to yield a revenue gain of about Rs 40 crores."
6489,1990-91,I propose to raise the specific rates of basic duties of excise on iron and steel.
6490,1990-91,The increase will generally be Rs 500 per tonne in the case of stainless steel items and Rs 100 per tonne in the case of other items.
6491,1990-91,"In the case of downstream dutiable products, MODVAT credit would continue to be available."
6492,1990-91,The revenue gain from this proposal is of the order of Rs 104 crores.
6493,1990-91,"Presently, the total rate of import duty on most of the stainless steel and articles thereof is 345%."
6494,1990-91,I propose to bring down the rate to the level of 200%.
6495,1990-91,The proposals in regard to customs duties on these and other steel items are expected to result in the loss of revenue to the tune of Rs 10 crores.
6496,1990-91,"At present, the country has a surplus production of aluminium."
6497,1990-91,"In order to discourage imports, I propose to increase the basic customs duty on aluminium ingots by Rs 3500 per tonne."
6498,1990-91,Major plastic raw materials attract excise duty ranging from 30% to 65%.
6499,1990-91,"However, the rate of duty on polystyrene is only 20%."
6500,1990-91,"As a measure of rationalisation, I propose to increase this rate to 30%."
6501,1990-91,The proposal is expected to yield additional revenue of Rs 5 crores.
6502,1990-91,I propose to increase the basic excise duty on paste grade PVC used in the manufacture of leather cloth from Rs 15000 to Rs 20000 per tonne as an antievasion measure.
6503,1990-91,The excise duty rates on PVC coated textiles are also proposed to be revised upwards.
6504,1990-91,These measures are expected to yield Rs 17.5 crores.
6505,1990-91,"At present, various categories of paints and varnishes are liable to excise duty at different rates ranging between 15% and 35%."
6506,1990-91,I propose to rationalise the rates by keeping only two levels of duty at 15% and 30% as against the present five rates.
6507,1990-91,The proposal involves prescribing a uniform excise duty of 15% on insulating varnishes and water based paints and 30% on oil based and plastic based decorative paints.
6508,1990-91,The proposal would yield a revenue of Rs 9 crores.
6509,1990-91,Currently special excise duty at the rate of 1/20th of the basic duty of excise is being levied on indigenously produced goods.
6510,1990-91,"However, for the computation of countervailing duty of customs on imported goods, special excise duty is not taken into account."
6511,1990-91,I do not think such a distinction is warranted.
6512,1990-91,I propose to subject the imported goods to countervailing duty on the basis of the excise duty inclusive of special excise duty.
6513,1990-91,This proposal is expected to yield customs revenue of Rs 60 crores.
6514,1990-91,The Baggage Rules relating to free allowance admissible to passengers arriving from foreign countries are being modified.
6515,1990-91,The general free allowance is being increased from the existing level of Rs 1250 to Rs 2000 per passenger.
6516,1990-91,There will be a uniform duty rate of 250% for baggage in excess of this limit as against the existing 175% and 245%.
6517,1990-91,"The revised measures will take effect from the 1st April, 1990."
6518,1990-91,Provision is being made for continuance of auxiliary duty of customs and special excise duty at the existing rates.
6519,1990-91,"As the Honourable Members are aware, Inland Air Travel Tax was introduced in the Budget of last year."
6520,1990-91,"The tax is leviable at 10% of one component of the total air fare, namely, basic fare."
6521,1990-91,I propose to levy the tax at the existing rate on the full air fare.
6522,1990-91,The estimated revenue gain from the proposal will be Rs 15 crores.
6523,1990-91,"As I mentioned in the earlier part of my speech, in recent years our consumption of petroleum products has risen sharply."
6524,1990-91,Honourable Members are also aware that petroleum prices abroad have been hardening.
6525,1990-91,The greater dependence on import has led to a large outflow of foreign exchange and higher overall foreign borrowing.
6526,1990-91,It has now become necessary to review the domestic prices of petroleum products.
6527,1990-91,"Keeping in view the interests of the common man, there will be no increase, I repeat, no increase in prices of kerosene and LPG cylinders."
6528,1990-91,There will also be no increase in prices of naphtha for fertilizers and other uses.
6529,1990-91,"Among the selected items whose prices are being revised with effect from this midnight are motor spirit, high speed diesel oil and aviation turbine fuel for domestic users."
6530,1990-91,"While the price of motor spirit is being raised by Rs 1.25 per litre exstorage, the price of high speed diesel oil will go up by 54 paise per litre."
6531,1990-91,The price of aviation turbine fuel will increase by Rs 1320.45 per kilolitre.
6532,1990-91,The increase in retail prices will vary from State to State depending on transportation charges and the incidence of local taxes and levies.
6533,1990-91,I propose to mop up a part of the gain accruing to the oil companies as a result of price revision.
6534,1990-91,The import duty on crude oil is being increased from Rs 1060 to Rs 1500 per tonne.
6535,1990-91,This will yield a revenue of Rs 836 crores.
6536,1990-91,The government is compelled to perform this painful duty of increasing the prices of some petroleum products.
6537,1990-91,"But these are the hard options forced on us by the grave fiscal situation, rising external debts, and the difficult balance of payments position."
6538,1990-91,We could have postponed these options only at the peril of our economic independence and selfreliance.
6539,1990-91,I have also proposed certain amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect changes in the excise and customs tariffs.
6540,1990-91,These amendments are generally enabling provisions and have no revenue significance.
6541,1990-91,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
6542,1990-91,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
6543,1990-91,The proposals in regard to changes in die excise duties outlined above are likely to yield additional revenue of Rs 778.63.crores.
6544,1990-91,The concessions and reliefs announced aggregate to Rs 388.44 crores.
6545,1990-91,"Out of the net additional shareable revenue from excise duties of Rs 390.19 crores, the centre’s share would be Rs 217.12 crores and the States share is Rs 173.07 crores."
6546,1990-91,My tax effort in respect of customs duties will bring in Rs 979.79 crores.
6547,1990-91,"Net of reliefs amounting to Rs 144.76 crores, the additional revenue from customs duties accruing to the Centre will be Rs 835.03 crores."
6548,1990-91,"Besides, the changes in the Inland Air Travel Tax would yield Rs 15 crores."
6549,1990-91,"Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties effective from the 20th March, 1990 will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
6550,1990-91,"I now have something to say on behalf of my Honourable colleague, the Minister of Communications."
6551,1990-91,Postal Service is highly employment intensive and salary and allowances constitute a major part of the operating expenses of the Postal Department.
6552,1990-91,The grant of additional instalments of Dearness Allowance and increases in other operational expenses add significantly to these costs.
6553,1990-91,The postal rates do not meet even the direct cost of most of the services.
6554,1990-91,"A revision of tariff for some postal services has, therefore, become unavoidable."
6555,1990-91,"However, in the interest of the common 26 man and cheap and wider dissemination of information, there will be no change in the tariff for ordinary postcards and registered newspapers."
6556,1990-91,"The rate of printed postcard, which is used mainly for business purposes, is being raised from 40 paise to 60 paise, of inland letter card from 50 paise, inclusive of the stationery charge, to a consolidated amount of 75 paise, and of envelopes to a uniform rate of Re. one for every 20 grains without any stationery charge."
6557,1990-91,There are also certain other changes which are explained in the memorandum circulated alongwith the Budget documents.
6558,1990-91,The changes would take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed.
6559,1990-91,The revisions proposed are estimated to yield an additional revenue of about Rs 207 crores in a full year and about Rs 172 crores in 199091.
6560,1990-91,"Honourable Members will recall that the 46th Constitution Amendment Act, 1982 gave enabling powers to the Parliament to levy a tax on consignment of goods where such consignment takes place in the course of interstate trade or commerce."
6561,1990-91,"However, there have been differences of opinion on the modalities of implementation of this law and the matter has been discussed in various meetings of the Chief Ministers."
6562,1990-91,"The broad parameters have now been settled and a Committee of Chief Ministers was appointed to work out the guidelines for granting exemptions from this tax, both by the Centre and the States."
6563,1990-91,I propose to consult the Chief Ministers shortly to take a final view in the matter.
6564,1990-91,I had earlier mentioned that the budget deficit at the existing rates of taxes would be Rs 9165 crows.
6565,1990-91,"Taking into account the net additional yield from the modifications proposed in direct and indirect taxes and the revised postal tariff, the deficit for the next year is estimated at Rs 7206 crores."
6566,1990-91,Honourable Members will note that this deficit is substantially lower than the deficit of Rs 11750 crores in the revised estimates of 198990.
6567,1990-91,"In order to give the right signal and contain inflationary pressure, I have also tried to keep next year’s deficit even lower than the budget estimate of Rs 7337 crores for the current year."
6568,1990-91,It is my firm determination that the deficit provided for in the budget should not be exceeded.
6569,1990-91,"A halfyearly review of the actual developments in the budgetary situation will be made, and the people and the Parliament kept informed about the performance in relation to the deficit."
6570,1990-91,We need to make our fiscal and tax system more stable and predictable.
6571,1990-91,"The system of making a large number of changes in the tax rates and tax laws every year, apart from introducing uncertainty, casts a severe burden on the administrative system."
6572,1990-91,It also affects compliance and increases litigation.
6573,1990-91,"While some changes in tax rates and laws are inevitable, it is desirable to keep the basic structure stable at least for some time."
6574,1990-91,"With this end in view, the Government will present a document on the Long Term Fiscal Policy to Parliament."
6575,1990-91,"With this, I have come to the end of my labours."
6576,1990-91,We faced a fiscal situation which constituted a threat to the economic strength and stability of our country.
6577,1990-91,"The 27 choice before us was to let things drift, borrow more and consume more or to take the corrective action now, however difficult."
6578,1990-91,We have made our choice.
6579,1990-91,We have taken some resources from the rich and used them to give some relief to the poor and the common man..
6580,1990-91,We have begun a process to restrain the budgetary deficit and contain the inflationary pressure.
6581,1990-91,We have tilted the balance of planning and investment towards the rural areas and in favour of employment.
6582,1990-91,"As a man of science, wedded to nondoctrinaire socialism, I consider experimentation and its results the touchstone on which can be tested the relevance of all social and economic perceptions and policies."
6583,1990-91,"This is the essence of pragmatism and the quintessence of the unending quest of socioeconomic experimenters like Gandhiji, Jaya Prakash and Acharya Narendra Dev."
6584,1990-91,"Mr. Speaker, with my irrevocable commitment to such a pragmatic approach, I present this Budget to this august House as a short term device to move steadily, and yet resolutely, towards the long term objective of ensuring growth with equity and selfreliance."
6585,1990-91,"In this endeavour, I seek the wholehearted support of the people through their chosen democratic instrument  this honourable Parliament."
6586,1990-91,"Sir, I commend the Budget to the House."
6587,1991-92,I rise to present the budget for 199192.
6588,1991-92,"As I rise, I am overpowered by a strange feeling of loneliness."
6589,1991-92,"I miss a handsome, smiling, face listening intently to the Budget Speech."
6590,1991-92,Shri Rajiv Gandhi is no more.
6591,1991-92,"But his dream lives on; his dream of ushering India into the twentyfirst century; his dream of a strong, united, technologically sophisticated but humane India."
6592,1991-92,I dedicate this budget to his inspiring memory.
6593,1991-92,"The new Government, which assumed office barely a month ago, inherited an economy in deep crisis."
6594,1991-92,The balance of payments situation is precarious.
6595,1991-92,International confidence in our economy was strong until November 1989 when our Party was in office.
6596,1991-92,"However, due to the combined impact of political instability witnessed thereafter, the accentuation of fiscal imbalances and the Gulf crisis, there was a great weakening of international confidence."
6597,1991-92,There has been a sharp decline in capital inflows through commercial borrowing and nonresident deposits.
6598,1991-92,"As a result, despite large borrowings from the International Monetary Fund in July 1990 and January 1991, there was a sharp reduction in our foreign exchange reserves."
6599,1991-92,We have been at the edge of a precipice since December 1990 and more so since April 1991.
6600,1991-92,The foreign exchange crisis constitutes a serious threat to the sustainability of growth processes and orderly implementation of our development programmes.
6601,1991-92,"Due to the combination of unfavourable internal and external factors, the inflationary pressures on the price level have increased very substantially since mid1990."
6602,1991-92,The people of India have to face double digit inflation which hurts most the poorer sections of our society.
6603,1991-92,"In sum, the crisis in the economy is both acute and deep."
6604,1991-92,We have not experienced anything similar in the history of independent India.
6605,1991-92,"The origins of the problem are directly traceable to large and persistent macroeconomic imbalances and the low productivity of investment, in particular the poor rates of return on past investments."
6606,1991-92,There has been an unsustainable increase in Government expenditure.
6607,1991-92,"Budgetary subsidies, with questionable social 1 199192 2 and economic impact, have been allowed to grow to an alarming extent."
6608,1991-92,The tax system still has many loopholes.
6609,1991-92,It lacks transparency so that it is not easy to assess the social and economic impact of various concessions built into its structure.
6610,1991-92,The public sector has not been managed in a manner so as to generate large investible surpluses.
6611,1991-92,The excessive and often indiscriminate protection provided to industry has weakened the incentive to develop a vibrant export sector.
6612,1991-92,It has also accentuated disparities in income and wealth.
6613,1991-92,It has worked to the disadvantage of the rural economy.
6614,1991-92,The increasing difference between the income and expenditure of the Government has led to a widening of the gap between the income and expenditure of the economy as a whole.
6615,1991-92,This is reflected in growing current account deficits in the balance of payments.
6616,1991-92,The crisis of the fiscal system is a cause for serious concern.
6617,1991-92,"The fiscal deficit of the Central Government, which measures the difference between revenue receipts and total expenditure, is estimated at more than 8 per cent of GDP in 199091, as compared with 6 per cent at the beginning of the 1980s and 4 per cent in the mid1970s."
6618,1991-92,This fiscal deficit had to be met by borrowing.
6619,1991-92,"As a result, internal public debt of the Central Government has accumulated to about 55 per cent of Gross Domestic Product GDP."
6620,1991-92,The burden of servicing this debt has now become onerous.
6621,1991-92,Interest payments alone are about 4 per cent of GDP and constitute almost 20 per cent of the total expenditure of the Central Government.
6622,1991-92,"Without decisive action now, the situation will move beyond the possibility of corrective action."
6623,1991-92,The balance of payments situation is most difficult.
6624,1991-92,"The current account deficit, which was about 2 per cent of GDP for several years, is estimated to be more than 2.5 per cent of GDP in 199091."
6625,1991-92,"These persistent deficits, which were inevitably financed by borrowings from abroad, have led to a continuous increase in external debt which, including nonresident Indian NRI deposits, is estimated at 23 per cent of GDP at the end of 199091."
6626,1991-92,"Consequently, the debt service burden is estimated at about 21 per cent of current account receipts in 199091."
6627,1991-92,These strains were stretched to a breaking point on account of the Gulf crisis last year.
6628,1991-92,The balance of payments has lurched from one liquidity crisis to another since December 1990.
6629,1991-92,"The current level of foreign exchange reserves, in the range of Rs 2500 crores, would suffice to finance imports for a mere fortnight."
6630,1991-92,"The price situation, which is of immediate concern to the vast mass of our people, poses a serious problem as inflation has reached a double digit level."
6631,1991-92,"During the fiscal year ending 31st March 1991 the wholesale price index registered an increase of 12.1 per cent, while the consumer price index registered an increase of 13.6 per cent."
6632,1991-92,The major worrisome feature of the inflation in 199091 was that it was concentrated in essential commodities.
6633,1991-92,The prices of these commodities rose inspite of the three good monsoons in a row and hence the three successive bumper harvests.
6634,1991-92,"Inflation hurts everybody, more so the poorer segments of our population whose incomes are not indexed."
6635,1991-92,There is no time to lose.
6636,1991-92,Neither the Government nor the economy can live beyond its means year after year.
6637,1991-92,"The room for maneuver, to live on borrowed money or time, does not exist any more."
6638,1991-92,"Any further postponement of macro economic adjustment, long overdue, would mean that the balance of payments situation, now exceedingly difficult, would become unmanageable and inflation, 3 already high, would exceed limits of tolerance."
6639,1991-92,"For improving the management of the economy, the starting point, and indeed the centrepiece of our strategy, should be a credible fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic stabilisation during the current financial year, to be followed by continued fiscal consolidation thereafter."
6640,1991-92,"This process would, inevitably, need at least three years, if not longer, to complete."
6641,1991-92,But there can be no adjustment without pain.
6642,1991-92,The people must be prepared to make necessary sacrifices to preserve our economic independence and restore the health of our economy.
6643,1991-92,"In the macromanagement of the economy, over the mediumterm, it should be our objective to progressively reduce the fiscal deficit of the Central Government, to move towards a significant reduction of the revenue deficit, and to reduce the current account deficit in the balance of payments."
6644,1991-92,"It is only such prudent management that would enable us to curb the exponential growth in internal and external debt and limit the burden on debt servicing, for the Government and the country, to manageable levels."
6645,1991-92,"Indeed, we must make a conscious effort to reduce the internal debt of the Government and the external debt of the nation, so that we rely more and more on our own resources to finance the process of development."
6646,1991-92,"During the period of transition, it shall be our endeavour to minimise the burden of adjustment on the poor."
6647,1991-92,We are committed to adjustment with a human face.
6648,1991-92,It will also be our endeavour that the adjustment process does not adversely affect the underlying growth impulses in our economy.
6649,1991-92,We do not have time to postpone adjustment and stabilisation.
6650,1991-92,We must act fast and act boldly.
6651,1991-92,"If we do not introduce the needed correctives, the existing situation can only retard growth, induce recession and fuel inflation, which would hurt the economy further and impose a far greater burden on the poor."
6652,1991-92,Macroeconomic stabilisation and fiscal adjustment alone cannot suffice.
6653,1991-92,"They must be supported by essential reforms in economic policy and economic management, as an integral part of the adjustment process, reforms which would help to eliminate waste and inefficiency and impart a new element of dynamism to growth processes in our economy."
6654,1991-92,"The thrust of the reform process would be to increase the efficiency and international competitiveness of industrial production, to utilise for this purpose foreign investment and foreign technology to a much greater degree than we have done in the past, to increase the productivity of investment, to ensure that India’s financial sector is rapidly modernised, and to improve the performance of the public sector, so that the key sectors of our economy are enabled to attain an adequate technological and competitive edge in a fast changing global economy."
6655,1991-92,"I am confident that, after a successful implementation of stabilisation measures and the essential structural and policy reforms, our economy would return to a path of a high sustained growth with reasonable price stability and greater social equity."
6656,1991-92,"Thanks to the efforts of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, we have developed a well diversified industrial structure."
6657,1991-92,This constitutes a great asset as we begin to implement various structural reforms.
6658,1991-92,"However, barriers to entry and limits on growth in the size of firms, have often led to a proliferation of licensing and an increase in the degree of monopoly."
6659,1991-92,This has put shackles on segments of Indian industry and made them serve the interests of producers but not pay adequate attention to the interests of consumers.
6660,1991-92,"There has been inadequate emphasis on reduction of costs, upgradation of technology and improvement of 4 quality standards."
6661,1991-92,"It is essential to increase the degree of competition between firms in the domestic market so that there are adequate incentives for raising productivity, improving efficiency and reducing costs."
6662,1991-92,"In the pursuit of this objective, we have announced important changes in industrial policy which will bring about a significant measure of deregulation in the domestic sector, consistent with our social objectives and the binding constraints on the balance of payments."
6663,1991-92,The policies for industrial development are intimately related to policies for trade.
6664,1991-92,"There can be no doubt that protection was essential in the initial phase of our industrial development, so that we could go through the learning period without disruption."
6665,1991-92,The past four decades have witnessed import substitution which has not always been efficient and has some times been indiscriminate.
6666,1991-92,The time has come to expose Indian industry to competition from abroad in a phased manner.
6667,1991-92,"As a first step in this direction, the Government has introduced changes in import export policy, aimed at a reduction of import licensing, vigorous export promotion and optimal import compression."
6668,1991-92,The exchange rate adjustments on 1st and 3rd July 1991 and the enlargement and liberalisation of the replenishment licence system constitute the two major initial steps in the direction of trade policy reform.
6669,1991-92,They represent the beginning of a transition from a regime of quantitative restrictions to a price based mechanism.
6670,1991-92,"After four decades of planning for industrialisation, we have now reached a stage of development where we should welcome, rather than fear, foreign investment."
6671,1991-92,Our entrepreneurs are second to none.
6672,1991-92,Our industry has come of age.
6673,1991-92,"Direct foreign investment would provide access to capital, technology and markets."
6674,1991-92,It would expose our industrial sector to competition from abroad in a phased manner.
6675,1991-92,"Cost, efficiency, and quality would begin to receive the attention they deserve."
6676,1991-92,"We have, therefore, decided to liberalise the policy regime for direct foreign investment in the following manner."
6677,1991-92,"First, direct foreign investment in specified high priority industries, with a raised limit for foreign equity at 51 per cent, would be given prompt approval, if equity inflows are sufficient to finance the import of capital goods at the stage of investment and if dividends are balanced by export earnings over a period of time."
6678,1991-92,"Second, foreign equity upto 51 per cent would be allowed for trading companies primarily engaged in export activities."
6679,1991-92,"Third, a special board would be constituted to negotiate with a number of large international firms and approve direct foreign investment in selected areas; this would be a special regime to attract substantial investment that would provide access to high technology and to world markets."
6680,1991-92,"For the founding fathers of our Republic, a public sector that would be vibrant, modern, competitive and capable of generating large surpluses was a vital element in the strategy of development."
6681,1991-92,The public sector has made an important contribution to the diversification of our industrial economy.
6682,1991-92,But there have been a number of shortcomings.
6683,1991-92,"In particular, the public sector has not been able to generate internal surpluses on a large enough scale."
6684,1991-92,"At this critical juncture, it has therefore become necessary to take effective measures so as to make the public sector an engine of growth rather than an absorber of national savings without adequate return."
6685,1991-92,"This has been widely accepted, but thought and action in this regard are still far apart."
6686,1991-92,"To bridge this gap, the portfolio of public sector investments would be reviewed so as to concentrate the future operations of the public sector in areas that are strategic for the nation, require high technology for the economy, 5 and are essential for the infrastructure."
6687,1991-92,"In order to raise resources, encourage wider public participation and promote greater accountability, upto 20 per cent of government equity in selected public sector undertakings would be offered to mutual funds and investment institutions in the public sector, as also to workers in these firms."
6688,1991-92,"Public enterprises which are chronically sick and which cannot be turned around, will be referred to the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction BIFR, or to a similar highpowered body to be set up, for the formulation of revival or rehabilitation schemes; a social security mechanism will be created to fully protect the interests of the workers likely to be affected by the rehabilitation packages of the BIFR."
6689,1991-92,"Autonomy in management, and corresponding accountability, would be provided through a system of memorandums of understanding between the Government and public sector enterprises."
6690,1991-92,Our banking system and financial institutions are at the very core of the financial infrastructure in the economy.
6691,1991-92,"The widening and deepening of our financial system have helped the spread of institutional finance over a vast area and have contributed significantly to the augmentation of our savings rate, particularly financial savings."
6692,1991-92,"This has been a most commendable achievement, but our financial system has developed certain rigidities and some weaknesses which we must address now ."
6693,1991-92,"The objective of reform in the financial sector would be to preserve its basic role as an essential adjunct to economic growth and competitive efficiency, while improving the health of its institutions."
6694,1991-92,"In this task, it is essential to ensure capital adequacy, introduce prudential norms and improve profitability of our commercial banks and financial institutions."
6695,1991-92,There are no magic solutions.
6696,1991-92,These are complex issues which need careful consideration.
6697,1991-92,"Therefore, I propose to appoint a high level committee to consider all relevant aspects of structure, organisation, functions and procedures of the financial system."
6698,1991-92,This committee would advise the Government on appropriate measures that would be needed to enhance the viability and health of our financial sector so that it can better serve the needs of the economy without any sacrifice of the canons and principles of a sound financial system.
6699,1991-92,Interest rates are a crucial dimension of the financial sector.
6700,1991-92,"In the formative stages of the development of credit markets, administrative intervention in interest rates is both necessary and desirable."
6701,1991-92,"At the present stage of our development, however, we can begin to relax the degree of intervention and impart a greater flexibility to the structure of interest rates."
6702,1991-92,"The Reserve Bank of India has already taken an important step in this direction, by stipulating a floor rate of interest and providing freedom to commercial banks to charge interest rates above the floor level based on their perceptions of risk."
6703,1991-92,"The Government proposes to extend a similar freedom to termlending financial institutions, where the minimum interest rate would be 15 per cent, and these institutions would be free to charge an interest rate in accordance with their perception of the creditworthiness of borrowers."
6704,1991-92,"With the exception of tax free bonds for the public sector, it is also proposed to remove all restrictions on interest rates for debentures, both convertible and non convertible, floated in the capital market."
6705,1991-92,"The interest rate on such debt instruments will hereafter be governed by market forces, and the credit rating of such debt instruments will become an integral part of the capital market process."
6706,1991-92,"In consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, the Government would continue to watch the structure of interest rates."
6707,1991-92,"Recently, interest rates payable on bank deposits have been increased."
6708,1991-92,I now propose to do a similar thing with regard to 6 interest rates payable under the small savings schemes.
6709,1991-92,Our ultimate objective is to achieve a significant reduction both in the nominal and the real interest rates.
6710,1991-92,This would be possible if the rate of inflation is reduced significantly over the next three years.
6711,1991-92,"While presenting the budget for 198788, our former Prime Minister the late Shri Rajiv Gandhi had assured this House that for a healthy growth of capital markets, for protecting the rights of investors and for preventing trading malpractices the Government would set up a separate Board for the regulation and orderly functioning of the Stock Exchanges and the securities industry."
6712,1991-92,"Although the Board was set up, legislation to give the Board adequate powers was unfortunately not enacted."
6713,1991-92,This shall now be done forthwith and full statutory powers will be given to the Securities and Exchange Board of India for administering the relevant provisions of the Securities Contracts Regulation Act and the Companies Act.
6714,1991-92,"Transferring these powers from the Controller of Capital Issues and the Government to an independent body would enable it to effectively regulate, promote and monitor the working of the Stock Exchanges in the country."
6715,1991-92,"A comprehensive package of reforms relating to trading on the Stock Exchanges, including a system of national clearing and settlement and setting up of a central depository, is also under active consideration."
6716,1991-92,"In regard to Mutual Funds, some progress towards evolving a competitive structure has been made in the last few years with encouraging results."
6717,1991-92,"For many investors, mutual funds are a more suitable investment vehicle than direct ownership of shares."
6718,1991-92,The Government is already giving tax incentives for equitylinked savings schemes offered through mutual funds.
6719,1991-92,The Government has now decided to further promote the development of mutual funds by throwing the field open to the private sector and joint sector mutual funds.
6720,1991-92,"In order to safeguard the interests of the investing public, and to encourage a healthy growth of the capital markets, a comprehensive set of guidelines is being evolved for the operation of all mutual funds."
6721,1991-92,Consideration will also be given to enactment of legislation for this purpose.
6722,1991-92,A comprehensive review of policies and procedures bearing on Nonresident Indian investments shall be carried out and further relaxations made in order to remove all procedural difficulties and impediments to the setting up of industrial and other ventures by Nonresident Indians.
6723,1991-92,"New sectors shall be made available to NRIs for investment on a nonrepatriation basis, including housing, infrastructure and real estate development."
6724,1991-92,"For example, at present, NRIs of foreign nationality are required to obtain specific permission under section 31 of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act FERA to acquire residential property."
6725,1991-92,It is now proposed to provide general exemption from this provision to such persons.
6726,1991-92,"However, rental income and proceeds from the sale of such housing will be nonrepatriable."
6727,1991-92,"For facilitating interaction with the Central Government, to serve as a focal point for NRIs, Government proposes to establish a Chief Commissioner for Nonresident Indians."
6728,1991-92,"I would urge State Governments, also, to establish an office of a Commissioner for NonResident Indians."
6729,1991-92,"I believe that the time has come to evolve a more transparent institutional mechanism for fixing tariffs and domestic prices in sectors where there might still be need for protecting Indian industry against foreign competition and for the determination of administered prices, particularly in the area of public utilities."
6730,1991-92,"For 7 this purpose, we propose to restructure the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices and to transform it into a Tariff Commission."
6731,1991-92,"As we enter the last decade of the twentieth century, India stands at the crossroads."
6732,1991-92,"The decisions we take and do not take, at this juncture, will determine the shape of things to come for quite some time."
6733,1991-92,"It should come as no surprise, therefore, that an intense debate rages throughout the country as to the path we should adopt."
6734,1991-92,In a democratic society it could not be otherwise.
6735,1991-92,What can we learn from this debate?
6736,1991-92,"The most important thing that comes out clearly is that we cannot realise our goal of establishing a just society, if we abandon the planning process."
6737,1991-92,But India’s future development depends crucially on how well the planning process is adapted to the needs of a fast changing situation.
6738,1991-92,"I believe that without an intelligent and systematic coordinated resource use in some major sectors of our economy, development will be lopsided."
6739,1991-92,"It will violate deeply cherished values of equity and it will keep India well below its social, intellectual and moral potential."
6740,1991-92,But our planning processes must be sensitive to the needs of a dynamic economy.
6741,1991-92,Over centralisation and excessive bureaucratisation of economic processes have proved to be counter productive.
6742,1991-92,We need to expand the scope and the area for the operation of market forces.
6743,1991-92,A reformed price system can be a superior instrument of resource allocation than quantitative controls.
6744,1991-92,But markets can only serve those who are part of the market system.
6745,1991-92,A vast number of people in our country live on the edges of a subsistence economy.
6746,1991-92,We need credible programmes of direct government intervention focussing on the needs of these people.
6747,1991-92,"We have the responsibility to provide them with quality social services such as education, health, safe drinking water and roads."
6748,1991-92,"In the same way, the development of capital and technology intensive sectors, characterised by long gestation periods, such as transport and communications and energy will need to be planned with much greater care than ever before."
6749,1991-92,"The control of land and water degradation, which threatens the livelihood of millions of poor people in this country, will also require effective Government leadership and action."
6750,1991-92,The challenge that we are facing is without precedent.
6751,1991-92,"In its initial stages, the Industrial Revolution in the western world concentrated on the creation of wealth, unmindful of the social misery and inequity which characterised this process."
6752,1991-92,The democratisation of the polity came much later.
6753,1991-92,"The socialist experiment in charting a new path for accelerated industrial transformation of an underdeveloped economy and polity did achieve considerable success in developing technological and military capabilities, accumulation of capital for rapid industrial growth and human resources development, in countries such as the USSR."
6754,1991-92,"But recent developments have shown that this approach too suffered from major weaknesses, particularly in its allocative efficiency, in the management of technical change, control of environmental degradation and in harnessing the vast latent energy and talents of individuals."
6755,1991-92,"In India, we launched an experiment under the leadership of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, an experiment which sought to unite the strengths and merits of different approaches to accelerated development of our backward economy."
6756,1991-92,"We have achieved considerable success in the field of development, modernisation and greater social equity."
6757,1991-92,"However, we are yet far from realising our full potential in all these areas."
6758,1991-92,"We have to accomplish the unfinished task, while remaining steadfast in our allegiance to the values of a democratic system."
6759,1991-92,"At the same time, we must restore to the creation of wealth its proper 8 place in the development process."
6760,1991-92,"For, without it, we cannot remove the stigma of abject poverty, ignorance and disease."
6761,1991-92,But we cannot accept social misery and inequity as unavoidable in the process of creation of wealth.
6762,1991-92,The basic challenge of our times is to ensure that wealth creation is not only tempered by equity and justice but is harnessed to the goal of removal of poverty and development for all.
6763,1991-92,"For the creation of wealth, we must encourage accumulation of capital."
6764,1991-92,This will inevitably mean a regime of austerity.
6765,1991-92,We have also to remove the stumbling blocks from the path of those who are creating wealth.
6766,1991-92,"At the same time, we have to develop a new attitude towards wealth."
6767,1991-92,"In the ultimate analysis, all wealth is a social product."
6768,1991-92,"Those who create it and own it, have to hold it as a trust and use it in the interest of the society, and particularly of those who are underprivileged and without means."
6769,1991-92,"Years ago, Gandhiji expounded the philosophy of trusteeship."
6770,1991-92,This philosophy should be our guiding star.
6771,1991-92,The austerity that Gandhiji practised and preached is a necessary condition for accelerated economic development in the framework of a democratic polity.
6772,1991-92,The trusteeship that he prescribed for the owners of wealth captured the idea of social responsibility.
6773,1991-92,"In highlighting the significance of reform, my purpose is not to give a fillip to mindless and heartless consumerism we have borrowed from the affluent societies of the West."
6774,1991-92,My objection to the consumerist phenomenon is twofold.
6775,1991-92,"First, we cannot afford it."
6776,1991-92,"In a society where we lack drinking water, education, health, shelter and other basic necessities, it would be tragic if our productive resources were to be devoted largely to the satisfaction of the needs of a small minority."
6777,1991-92,"The country’s needs for water, for drinking and for irrigation, rural roads, good urban infrastructure, and massive investments in primary education and basic health services for the poor are so great as to effectively preclude encouragement to consumerist behaviour imitative of advanced industrial societies."
6778,1991-92,Our approach to development has to combine efficiency with austerity.
6779,1991-92,"Austerity not in the sense of negation of life or a dry, arid creed that casts a baleful eye on joy and laughter."
6780,1991-92,"To my mind, austerity is a way of holding our society together in pursuit of the noble goal of banishing poverty, hunger and disease from this ancient land of ours."
6781,1991-92,Let me now turn to fiscal adjustment during the current financial year.
6782,1991-92,"The beginning of any attempt to correct the fiscal imbalance in the economy must be directed at a reduction in expenditure and an increase in income of the Government, so as to reduce the fiscal deficit."
6783,1991-92,"In the mediumterm, however, our fiscal regime would be sustainable only if revenue receipts not only meet revenue expenditure but also provide a sufficient surplus to finance capital expenditure that does not yield direct economic returns as such, as in defence or in social sectors."
6784,1991-92,Even this would not suffice if investment expenditures in the budget do not earn an adequate return.
6785,1991-92,The elimination of structural imbalances in our fiscal system would require a reduction both in the fiscal deficit and in the revenue deficit as a proportion of GDP.
6786,1991-92,The Union Budget for 199192 is an essential first step in this direction.
6787,1991-92,"It must be recognised that the necessary reduction in the fiscal deficit, during 199192, is a stupendous task."
6788,1991-92,The interim budget presented to Parliament in March 1991 estimated the fiscal deficit at Rs 38475 crores.
6789,1991-92,But this estimate was based on assumptions about certain decisions that have not been implemented.
6790,1991-92,The postponement of the regular budget has made a formidable task even more difficult because almost four months of the financial year have now elapsed without 9 any effort at fiscal correction.
6791,1991-92,"Indeed, past trends in revenue and expenditure suggest that, without any corrective action on our part, the fiscal deficit during 199192 could well reach a level of more than Rs 52000 crores."
6792,1991-92,The difference between the two sets of figures provides the real measure of the fiscal correction needed during the current financial year.
6793,1991-92,"According to provisional data available, the more narrowly defined budget deficit, as measured by borrowing through short term Treasury bills, for 199091 at Rs 11430 crores was significantly higher than the revised estimate of Rs 10722 crores, largely due to a substantial revenue shortfall, particularly in corporation tax revenues."
6794,1991-92,This highlights the handicap with which we begin.
6795,1991-92,Let me now present the scenario for 199192.
6796,1991-92,"The increasing levels of nonplan expenditure, financed through borrowing, have led to an exponential increase in interest payments by the Government."
6797,1991-92,"The revised estimates for interest payments during 199091, at Rs 21850 crores, accounted for as much as 38 per cent of the net revenue receipts of the Central Government."
6798,1991-92,"Interest payments during 199192, estimated at Rs 27450 crores, constitute 42 per cent of the net revenue receipts of the Central Government at existing rates of taxation."
6799,1991-92,"If the present trends continue without any correction, then interest payments could well account for more than 50 per cent of the net revenue receipts of the Central Government by 199495."
6800,1991-92,These magnitudes and proportions only serve to highlight the gravity of the situation and the acute need for a substantial adjustment in nonplan expenditure over the next three years.
6801,1991-92,The revised estimate for total nonplan expenditure in 199091 was Rs 76761 crores.
6802,1991-92,"In the normal course, even with the strictest scrutiny but in the absence of specific measures for reducing expenditure, this nonplan expenditure would have increased to a level of Rs 89000 crores in 199192."
6803,1991-92,Any attempt at fiscal correction during the current financial year can be meaningful only if non plan expenditure is reduced by at least 10 per cent from the level it would otherwise reach.
6804,1991-92,The single largest component of nonplan expenditure is interest payments.
6805,1991-92,"Even if there is a drastic reduction in Government borrowing during this year, interest payments would still be in the range of Rs 35000 crores in the next financial year."
6806,1991-92,"The exponential increase in interest payments can be brought under some measure of control, by 199495, only through a strict discipline on government borrowing for a period of three years."
6807,1991-92,"The second largest component of nonplan expenditure is the allocation for the defence sector, where the provision in the revised estimates for 199091 was Rs 15750 crores."
6808,1991-92,No attempt at containing nonplan expenditure can succeed if defence is to be excluded.
6809,1991-92,"At the same time, it is absolutely essential to ensure that a quest for economy in expenditure does not in any way compromise national security."
6810,1991-92,"We must, therefore, seek to limit expenditure without diluting the efficiency and effectiveness of our defence services."
6811,1991-92,"Keeping in view all these considerations, it has been decided to provide an outlay of Rs 16350 crores for defence in the current year."
6812,1991-92,Honourable Members are aware that export subsidies have been abolished with effect from 3 July 1991.
6813,1991-92,The export sector is being adequately compensated through the adjustments in the exchange rate and the expansion of the Replenishment Licensing System which were implemented at the beginning of July.
6814,1991-92,"Consequently, it is now necessary to provide only Rs 1224 crores for export subsidies in the budget estimates for 199192, as compared with the earlier estimated requirement of Rs 4200 crores, yielding a saving of as much as Rs 3000 crores during the remainder of this year."
6815,1991-92,"In so far as fertiliser subsidies are concerned, with effect from this evening, low analysis fertilisers such as calcium ammonium nitrate, ammonium chloride, ammonium sulphate and sulphate of potash will be free from price and movement controls."
6816,1991-92,"There will be an increase of 40 per cent, on an average, in the price of all other fertilisers."
6817,1991-92,"In addition, in respect of single super phosphate, there shall also be a ceiling on the subsidy per tonne payable to producers so as to move towards total deregulation in the next few years; this should act as an incentive for all high cost units to reduce costs and improve efficiency."
6818,1991-92,"The necessary notifications in this regard are being issued separately, today, by the Ministry of Agriculture."
6819,1991-92,The economic rationale for an increase in the price of fertilisers is so obvious that it does not need to be stated.
6820,1991-92,"Nevertheless, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that there has been no increase in fertiliser prices since July 1981."
6821,1991-92,"In these ten years, there has been a continuous increase in the procurement prices of paddy and wheat, as also in the market prices of other crops, received by the agricultural sector."
6822,1991-92,Farmers will be compensated for the proposed increase in the price of fertilisers through suitable increases in procurement prices.
6823,1991-92,We would continue to ensure that 50 per cent of the plan resources are invested in the agricultural and rural sector.
6824,1991-92,The provision for the continuing schemes for assistance to small and marginal farmers for dug wells and shallow tubewells would be doubled.
6825,1991-92,"The ceilings on assistance in difficult areas, where the water table is very low, would be removed."
6826,1991-92,"Similarly, the provision for assistance for fresh water and brackish water aquaculture and for oilseeds and pulses production would be substantially stepped up."
6827,1991-92,"New schemes are being drawn up to popularise small tractors and matching implements, drip and sprinkler irrigation in areas where water is scarce, and quality seeds in low yield areas."
6828,1991-92,"Another new scheme that would be implemented from this kharif season is for providing assistance to State Governments, cooperative societies, and farmers’ groups to provide blanket plant protection cover on payment of a small fee in large identified areas under cotton or pulses."
6829,1991-92,It would also be possible to demonstrate the advantages of integrated pest management in these areas.
6830,1991-92,"In order to safeguard any possible loss in production because of increase in fertiliser prices, and any decline in consumption, the credit structure would be strengthened to ensure adequate availability of credit particularly to the small and marginal farmers."
6831,1991-92,"Simultaneously, soil testing laboratories and farm advisory services all over the country would be strengthened to ensure efficient use of fertilisers and popularise the use of biofertilisers."
6832,1991-92,We would also identify a few irrigation projects that can be completed in this very year and ensure that these are provided the necessary funds.
6833,1991-92,"The other new initiatives, also, would not be starved of funds."
6834,1991-92,As far as possible our emphasis will be on provision of quality services to our farmers and not on hand outs and subsidies.
6835,1991-92,"The sugar subsidy which is costing the exchequer about Rs 350 crores per annum is indeed an aberration, which crept into the system from January 1990, when the increase in the levy price paid to producers was not matched by a simultaneous increase in the issue price for consumers in the public distribution system."
6836,1991-92,"Small quantities of sugar are made available, mostly in metropolitan and 11 urban areas, under the public distribution system at Rs 5.25 per kg."
6837,1991-92,Government has decided that this subsidy should be abolished forthwith.
6838,1991-92,"Consequently, the issue price of sugar under the public distribution system will be increased by 85 paise per kg."
6839,1991-92,"At the same time, the public distribution system is being strengthened to serve more effectively the weaker sections of our population, particularly the rural poor, having special regard to their basic needs for foodgrains such as rice and wheat."
6840,1991-92,"The provision for food subsidies in the current year is being stepped up to Rs 2600 crores, as compared with only Rs 1800 crores provided in the interim budget and Rs 2450 crores provided in the revised estimates for 199091."
6841,1991-92,"As a result of the exchange rate adjustments, at the beginning of July 1991, there would be an increase in the rupee value of the import bill for crude oil and petroleum products."
6842,1991-92,"It is, therefore, necessary to raise the prices of petroleum products for domestic consumers."
6843,1991-92,This would also help to restrain the growth in consumption of petroleum products.
6844,1991-92,"The price of motor spirit, domestic LPG and aviation turbine fuel for domestic use would be raised by 20 per cent."
6845,1991-92,"The prices of other petroleum products, excluding diesel and kerosene for nonindustrial use,would be raised by 10 per cent."
6846,1991-92,"The price of kerosene, for nonindustrial use, would be reduced by 10 per cent which means a 50 per cent rollback in relation to the increase in the price that came into effect on 15 October 1990."
6847,1991-92,"Even in a most difficult financial situation, this is being done to protect the poor for whom kerosene is an essential source of light and fuel."
6848,1991-92,"While there will be no increase in the price of diesel, I would endeavour to protect the interests of the farmers who use diesel."
6849,1991-92,"For this purpose, I shall hold discussions with State Governments."
6850,1991-92,"The proposed increases in the prices of petroleum products will come into effect from this evening, and the necessary notification in this regard is being separately issued by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas."
6851,1991-92,"For nonplan expenditure, excluding interest payments, defence, and major subsidies, the total provision in the budget estimates for 199192 is Rs  28,073 crores, reflecting a reduction of Rs  1538 crores compared with the provision in the revised estimates for 199091."
6852,1991-92,"If we take into account the fact that no separate provision has been made for the payment of additional installments of dearness allowance by Ministries and Departments in the current year, the total reduction in such other nonplan expenditure will exceed Rs  2000 crores."
6853,1991-92,"In recent years, it has been the usual practice to issue instructions to Ministries that such additional requirements should be accommodated within the approved budget estimates."
6854,1991-92,This has invariably resulted in some programmes on the plan side being deprived of adequate resources.
6855,1991-92,It is my intention to effect maximum possible economies in the nonplan administrative expenditure.
6856,1991-92,"Therefore, all Ministries have been requested to prioritise their activities so that those which figure at the bottom of the list can be abridged, while those which have outlived their utility can be abandoned altogether."
6857,1991-92,This exercise has already been initiated by all Ministries and is expected to be completed by the end of August 1991.
6858,1991-92,"With this approach, the proposed reduction in other nonplan expenditure, which I am promising to the House, would be brought about in a more meaningful manner without leading to a reduction in the provision for plan programmes."
6859,1991-92,There is one large component of nonplan expenditure that is a burden on 12 the exchequer.
6860,1991-92,I refer to the Government’s obligation under the Rural Debt Relief Scheme.
6861,1991-92,"Unfortunately, there was a gross underestimation of the total fiscal liability under this scheme which was introduced last year."
6862,1991-92,"In addition to the sum of Rs  1500 crores provided in the revised estimates for last year, we have to provide Rs  1500 crores in the current year."
6863,1991-92,But this is not all.
6864,1991-92,We may need a similar provision in the next year.
6865,1991-92,"As a result of the major adjustments in the sphere of expenditure, which I have outlined in my speech, the budget estimate for total nonplan expenditure in 199192 stands at Rs  79,697 crores."
6866,1991-92,It is simply not possible to reduce interest payments in the short term.
6867,1991-92,"The provision for nonplan expenditure, excluding interest payments, in the current year represents a reduction of 4.9 per cent compared with the provisions in the revised estimates for 199091, and a reduction of almost 15 per cent in relation to what we would have had to provide this year, but for the specific correctives that are being introduced."
6868,1991-92,"We have, thus, more than fulfilled our commitment to reduce nonplan expenditure by 10 per cent, which was stated in our Party’s election manifesto."
6869,1991-92,The election manifesto of the Congress Party identifies areas for special emphasis in our strategy of development.
6870,1991-92,"These include a substantial augmentation of employment programmes, the construction of dwelling units for the weaker sections of our society, an expansion of the programme for irrigation wells and so on."
6871,1991-92,"This would need a change in, and some reorientation of, plan priorities, with a shift towards investment in rural areas and expenditure on programmes designed for the benefit of the poor."
6872,1991-92,"Our strategy would, of course, be reflected in the Eighth Five Year Plan, which would now commence on 1 April 1992."
6873,1991-92,"It shall be our endeavour to finalise the Eighth Plan document by the end of this calendar year, so that the annual plans for 199293, as well as the budgets of the Centre and the States for that year, reflect the changed priorities."
6874,1991-92,"As the Vote on Account had earlier been taken only to cover the expenditure in the first four months, this budget has had to be presented before the end of July, 1991."
6875,1991-92,"We have, thus, not had the time to reorient the Annual Plan for 1991 92 to reflect fully our various concerns."
6876,1991-92,"Moreover, this year’s annual plan has had to be situated in the context of the massive fiscal correction that we have to put through."
6877,1991-92,"In fact, it was first felt that it would be necessary to effect a substantial reduction in budget support for the Central Plan and Central Plan assistance for the States."
6878,1991-92,"I am, however, happy to inform the House that with the substantial cuts proposed in nonplan expenditure, it is now possible to protect the flow of Central Plan assistance to States and Union Territories at the level of Rs  14710 crores, as reflected in the interim budget for 199192."
6879,1991-92,"The Central plan outlay would, however, show a modest increase at Rs  42969 crores with a budget support of Rs  19015 crores."
6880,1991-92,"I am aware that in basic infrastructure areas such as power, coal, communications and petroleum, we will have to set our sights much higher."
6881,1991-92,"In the present situation, characterised by an acute shortage of foreign exchange, it is, in particular, imperative to augment substantially the domestic production of coal, crude oil, natural gas and electrical energy."
6882,1991-92,"Efforts will also have to be made on a crash basis for promoting utmost economy in use of energy through more efficient technologies in industry, agriculture, transport and domestic sectors."
6883,1991-92,The 13 transmission and distribution line losses would also have to be brought down drastically from the present high level of 22 per cent.
6884,1991-92,We shall address ourselves to all these tasks once we are through with taking stock of the situation.
6885,1991-92,"It is my earnest hope that, by then, thanks to the fiscal corrections now being put through, the resources position would improve, giving us the necessary flexibility."
6886,1991-92,"For the present, it has been my endeavour to maintain essential investment through appropriate support for the Central Plan despite binding constraints on the exchequer."
6887,1991-92,"In preparing this budget, I have sought to ensure that the burden of fiscal adjustment does not fall on State Governments."
6888,1991-92,"It is my belief that the Central Government must set an example by introducing fiscal correctives, and it is my hope that the State Governments would move in this direction as soon as possible."
6889,1991-92,"In particular, I would urge them to ensure prompt payment of dues owed by the State Electricity Boards to the National Thermal Power Corporation, Coal India and the Indian Railways."
6890,1991-92,We cannot allow State level enterprises to become an instrument of unplanned and unauthorised transfer of resources from the Centre to the States.
6891,1991-92,That is neither fair nor equitable.
6892,1991-92,"This practice must, therefore, stop forthwith."
6893,1991-92,"Simultaneously, State Governments must take effective steps to improve their fiscal performance and streamline the working of their public enterprises."
6894,1991-92,They should not expect me to reward fiscal laxity by permitting them to have recourse to unauthorised overdrafts from the Reserve Bank of India.
6895,1991-92,I want them to be an active partner in the accomplishment of the difficult task of restoring the fiscal health of the country.
6896,1991-92,"The process of macroeconomic adjustment, which is being initiated with this budget, would take at least three years to complete."
6897,1991-92,This adjustment must have a human face.
6898,1991-92,"Therefore, during the period of transition, we shall do everything that is possible to minimise the burden of adjustment on the poor."
6899,1991-92,"To some extent, the poor would be protected as the rate of inflation comes down."
6900,1991-92,We shall make determined efforts to control inflation and the price rise.
6901,1991-92,The fiscal strategy of this budget will make a major contribution in this regard.
6902,1991-92,"In addition, it will be our endeavour to provide protection to the poor in the form of enhanced outlays in the social sectors."
6903,1991-92,Employment creation and poverty eradication in rural India will continue to receive the highest priority.
6904,1991-92,"At the same time, Government is committed to the uplift of the weakest and the most vulnerable sections of our society."
6905,1991-92,The plan outlay for the Ministry of Rural Development is being stepped up from Rs 3115 crores last year to Rs  3508 crores this year.
6906,1991-92,"Within this, the outlay for employment programmes alone is Rs 2100 crores."
6907,1991-92,The various employment oriented programmes should make it possible to provide nearly 900 million man days of employment.
6908,1991-92,"If, this year, we are not aiming at the target of 1000 million mandays mentioned in our manifesto it is because the season when there is maximum need for such employment is already over."
6909,1991-92,"The Eighth Plan now under formulation will spell out a comprehensive strategy and programmes to achieve the long term employment objectives, and targets such as those relating to the construction of irrigation wells, urban night shelters and Sulabh Shauchalayas, dwelling units for poor backward classes, scheduled castes and scheduled tribes in the villages, mentioned in our Party’s election manifesto."
6910,1991-92,"The provision for the rural water supply scheme is being stepped up to Rs 758 crores, so as to make it possible to set aside Rs  250 crores for ensuring 14 complete coverage of ‘nosource problem villages’ by the end of 199293."
6911,1991-92,The earlier expectation was that these villages would be covered only by the end of the Eighth Plan period.
6912,1991-92,The late Shri Rajiv Gandhi had attached great priority to this programme and had set up a Technology Mission for this purpose.
6913,1991-92,"The programme, which is now being named after Shri Rajiv Gandhi, will be accelerated."
6914,1991-92,We will ensure that resource constraints do not stand in the way of achieving the target.
6915,1991-92,It is a matter of deep concern that we have still not been able to put an end to the dehumanising practice of manual removal of nightsoil.
6916,1991-92,The allocation for this programme has in the past been less than adequate.
6917,1991-92,It has now been decided not only to accelerate the programme for the conversion of drylatrines but also to step up the allocation for the rehabilitation and retraining of scavengers.
6918,1991-92,"Towards this end, the allocation for the programme has been increased by Rs  25 crores and more funds, to the extent necessary, would be provided during the course of the year."
6919,1991-92,"Inclusive of the increased provision for this programme, the total outlay for the programmes of the Ministry of Welfare, which is concerned with the welfare of scheduled castes, scheduled tribes and other weaker sections of our society, is being stepped up from Rs  364 crores in 199091 to Rs  479 crores in 199192."
6920,1991-92,"The outlay for the Department of Women and Child Development, dealing with perhaps the two most disadvantaged segments of our population among the poor, is being enhanced from Rs  330 crores last year to Rs  400 crores this year."
6921,1991-92,"For Health and Family Welfare, I am providing a plan outlay of Rs  1051 crores in 199192 as compared with Rs  950 crores in 1990 91."
6922,1991-92,The allocation of resources for investment in social sectors is of utmost importance for the development of human resources.
6923,1991-92,"In this context, there is no need for me to emphasise the importance of education, in particular, elementary education."
6924,1991-92,Our efforts to restructure and revitalise the economy can succeed only if we invest in our people.
6925,1991-92,"Particular attention has to be paid to the provision of quality education to children belonging to the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes and other economically and socially backward classes."
6926,1991-92,Children who belong to the category of first generation learners need special care and attention.
6927,1991-92,"If the equality of opportunity is to acquire its true significance, quality education must not remain the exclusive privilege of the children of the rich."
6928,1991-92,"The Government is committed to ensure that, whatever be our constraints, the programmes of education will not be allowed to suffer for want of financial support."
6929,1991-92,Every effort will be made to ensure that the constitutional directive of providing free and compulsory education upto the age of 14 years becomes a reality before we enter the twenty first century.
6930,1991-92,"In the sphere of higher education and technical education, more resources are needed for modernisation and diversification, but, at the same time, an effort must be made to secure optimum results from the existing investments in these institutions."
6931,1991-92,The requirements of education are vast and we shall have to seek innovative ways of finding resources.
6932,1991-92,"Budget support provided by the Central Government and the State Governments are an important source, but cannot continue to remain the only source."
6933,1991-92,I am raising the allocation for education from Rs 865 crores in 199091 to Rs 977 crores in 199192.
6934,1991-92,This allocation is not commensurate with my deep commitment to education and the priority that is attached by the Government to the education sector.
6935,1991-92,I would have liked to do more but we must learn to live with the constraints on the exchequer.
6936,1991-92,We have the third largest number of scientists and technologists in the world.
6937,1991-92,"Yet, technology development in our country has not been commensurate either with this number or the investments that we have been making in the science and technology sectors in our successive Five Year Plans."
6938,1991-92,"This gap would have to be bridged through a suitable reorientation of the Science and Technology Policy and the way paved for relating science and technology more intimately to the requirements of our development, as well as for better upgradation, absorption, adaptation and assimilation of new technologies."
6939,1991-92,This task has become imperative as we prepare ourselves to be an internationally competitive economy.
6940,1991-92,Government has also decided on five new initiatives.
6941,1991-92,"The first of these is the establishment of a Corporation for the welfare of the backward classes, a task that the Congress manifesto has included for completion within the first 100 days."
6942,1991-92,The details of the structure and duties of this Corporation are being finalised by the Ministry of Welfare and will be announced before the end of this session.
6943,1991-92,"Government will establish a National Renewal Fund, with a substantial corpus."
6944,1991-92,The main objective of this fund will be to ensure that the cost of technical change and modernisation of the productive apparatus does not devolve on the workers.
6945,1991-92,This fund will provide a social safety net which will protect the workers from the adverse consequences of the technological transformation.
6946,1991-92,I visualise that this fund will grow in size and State governments will also contribute to its corpus in due course.
6947,1991-92,"The fund will not merely provide ameliorative measures for the workers affected in the course of technical change but, more importantly, provide retraining to them, so that they are in a position to remain active productive partners in the process of modernisation."
6948,1991-92,The third programme relates to the care of children of families affected by communal riots.
6949,1991-92,These riots are a blot on the fair name of our Republic.
6950,1991-92,Our Government is deeply committed to the protection and advancement of all religious and cultural minorities.
6951,1991-92,Effective steps will be taken to prevent recurrence of communal violence.
6952,1991-92,At present there are arrangements to provide compensation of varying amounts to the riot affected families.
6953,1991-92,But experience shows that such compensation does not always protect the interests of children of the riot affected families.
6954,1991-92,These children then grow up into disgruntled and disorganised adulthood.
6955,1991-92,"They become an easy prey to the propaganda of antisocial elements and the obscurantist, fundamentalist forces of reaction."
6956,1991-92,"To protect the interests of such children, look after their welfare and in particular their education, the Government proposes to set up a National Foundation for Communal Harmony as an autonomous non government organisation."
6957,1991-92,The Central Government will make a significant contribution to this Foundation in 199192.
6958,1991-92,I invite State Governments as well as industry and trade to make liberal contributions for this noble cause.
6959,1991-92,"The fourth programme is to promote national integration through a scheme for enabling the youth of each part of the country to go in large numbers and work for short periods in other parts of the country, giving them an opportunity to mingle with people of different regions and languages."
6960,1991-92,A similar step in this direction has already been taken in the Navodaya Vidyalaya Programme.
6961,1991-92,This will now be strengthened and extended on a national basis.
6962,1991-92,The fifth programme relates to promotion of SouthSouth cooperation.
6963,1991-92,"We 16 as a nation are committed to close cooperation and sharing our development experience, knowledge and expertise with nonaligned and other developing countries."
6964,1991-92,"There is immense scope for Indian scientists, technicians, engineers, teachers, social workers and farmers to contribute to the development process in the third world."
6965,1991-92,Our experience in various fields can be of great relevance and assistance to many developing countries particularly in Asia and Africa.
6966,1991-92,"It is our hope to arrange for participation of at least 500 volunteers in different nation building tasks, in selected developing countries, in the coming year."
6967,1991-92,The details of the programmes will be worked out and announced before the end of the session.
6968,1991-92,"The House will also be pleased to learn that in acceptance of a recommendation of the South Commission presided over by Dr. Julius K. Nyerere, the former President of Tanzania, we propose to set up a National Committee under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister for mobilising public opinion in support of SouthSouth cooperation and for advising our Government for devising concrete action programmes in this regard."
6969,1991-92,"This committee will consist of representatives of Government, trade and industry, trade unions and members of learned professions."
6970,1991-92,The Rajiv Gandhi Foundation has been established to perpetuate the memory of the great leader and to promote the ideals and objectives for which he lived and laid down his life.
6971,1991-92,"This Foundation, among other things, will lay particular emphasis on research and action programmes relating to the application of science and technology for development, propagation of literacy, the protection of the environment, the promotion of communal harmony and national integration, the uplift of the underprivileged, women and handicapped persons, administrative reforms and India’s role in the global economy."
6972,1991-92,"As a homage to the late Shri Rajiv Gandhi and in support of the laudable objectives of the Foundation, Government has decided to contribute Rs 100 crores to the Foundation at the rate of Rs 20 crores per annum for a period of five years beginning from the current year."
6973,1991-92,"Pending determination of the exact amounts that will be necessary for each of these new initiatives, a lump sum provision of Rs 250 crores has been included in the plan outlay of the Ministry of Finance."
6974,1991-92,"The budget provision for total expenditure in 199192 is Rs 113422 crores, of which Rs 79697 crores is nonplan expenditure and Rs 33725 crores is plan expenditure."
6975,1991-92,"In the sphere of revenue receipts, at the existing rates of taxation, gross tax revenues are estimated at Rs 66218 crores during the current financial year, compared to Rs 58916 crores in the revised estimates of last year."
6976,1991-92,The payment to States of their share of taxes is placed at Rs 15643 crores in 199192 as against Rs 14535 crores in the revised estimates for 199091.
6977,1991-92,"Thus, the net revenue receipts of the Centre, including nontax revenue, are estimated to increase from Rs 57381 crores in 199091 to Rs 65524 crores in 199192."
6978,1991-92,"In the sphere of capital receipts, market borrowings are placed at Rs 7500 crores this year, which is lower than Rs 8000 crores last year; this is part of a conscious effort to reduce the borrowing of the Central Government which would, in keeping with the past trends, have gone up by about 10 per cent."
6979,1991-92,"The net collections on account of small savings are estimated at Rs 8000 crores, which are at the same level as the revised estimates for last year."
6980,1991-92,"In addition, the Government 17 has decided to disinvest upto 20 per cent of its equity in selected public sector undertakings in favour of mutual funds and investment institutions in the public sector, which is expected to yield Rs 2500 crores to the exchequer during the current financial year."
6981,1991-92,"This disinvestment would broadbase the equity, improve the management and enhance the availability of resources in these enterprises."
6982,1991-92,"The net receipts on account of external assistance, excluding grants, are placed at Rs 3510 crores compared to Rs 3984 crores in the revised estimates of 199091."
6983,1991-92,"While the increase in the loan repayment and interest payment liabilities, as a consequence of the recent exchange rate adjustments, is fully reflected in the budget estimates, the likely increase in the rupee value of external assistance following the exchange rate adjustments is still under assessment."
6984,1991-92,"To the extent that these receipts increase, there will also be a corresponding increase in expenditure when the assistance is passed on to the concerned projects or schemes for which such assistance is received."
6985,1991-92,"These changes, which will thus be budget deficit neutral, will be incorporated at the stage of revised estimates."
6986,1991-92,"Taking into account other changes in receipts and expenditure, total receipts at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 103698 crores, while total expenditure is estimated at Rs 113422 crores."
6987,1991-92,"Therefore, without additional resource mobilisation, the budget deficit is estimated at Rs 9724 crores, the revenue deficit at Rs 15859 crores, and the fiscal deficit at Rs 39732 crores."
6988,1991-92,Honourable Members would have observed that expenditure adjustment constitutes the core of the proposed fiscal correction during the current financial year.
6989,1991-92,But the process of fiscal adjustment cannot be complete without revenue measures to increase the income of the Government.
6990,1991-92,"I now seek the indulgence of the House to present the reliefs, the incentives and the levies in the sphere of direct taxes."
6991,1991-92,"The revenue from direct taxes, both as a proportion of GDP and as a percentage of total tax revenues, has registered a steady decline over time."
6992,1991-92,"This trend has to be reversed, so as to restore equity in, and balance to our fiscal system."
6993,1991-92,Resources for development must be raised from those who have the capacity to pay.
6994,1991-92,"For this purpose, we must place greater emphasis on direct taxes."
6995,1991-92,This calls for increased rates wherever necessary and a better tax compliance.
6996,1991-92,"At the same time, rationalisation of the system, which reduces the maximum marginal rate of tax, simplifies the procedures, reduces the plethora of concessions, and brings the average rates of income tax at various levels of income to more appropriate levels, is necessary."
6997,1991-92,The time available before presenting the budget was simply not enough to formulate basic structural changes.
6998,1991-92,"Yet, I have made a conscious effort to move one step forward in this direction."
6999,1991-92,"Nobody can deny the existence of large scale tax evasion, both in terms of income and in terms of wealth."
7000,1991-92,"Unless I find substantial improvement in tax compliance in the next few months, Government will have no choice but to take strong measures to make the tax evader pay a sufficiently high price for such delinquency."
7001,1991-92,"Before coming down heavily on tax evaders, I would like to give them 18 a last opportunity to come clean."
7002,1991-92,The black money so mobilised will be utilised for the achievement of social objectives such as slum clearance and low cost housing for the rural poor.
7003,1991-92,"I propose to institute a scheme, under which any person would be allowed to make a deposit with the National Housing Bank on or before close of business on 30th November, 1991."
7004,1991-92,"Thereupon, forty per cent of such deposit would be deducted and set apart as a special levy, which would form the corpus of a fund in the National Housing Bank."
7005,1991-92,"This fund will be utilised for financing slum clearance and low cost housing for the poor, in accordance with guidelines and priorities laid down by the Government."
7006,1991-92,The depositor would be allowed to draw the balance amount in one or more installments through account payee cheques for any stated purpose of his choice.
7007,1991-92,There will be no lockin period for this deposit.
7008,1991-92,Persons making such deposits will not be required to disclose the source of funds from which the deposits are made.
7009,1991-92,"In other words, the monies deposited would be provided complete immunity from enquiry and investigation."
7010,1991-92,"The provisions of Direct Tax Laws would, however, apply to the net deposits after deduction of the special levy, from the date of the deposit."
7011,1991-92,The levy itself would not be an allowable deduction in the computation of income of the person concerned.
7012,1991-92,"Necessary legislation in this regard will be introduced shortly, in this session of Parliament."
7013,1991-92,The details of the scheme and its date of commencement will also be announced soon.
7014,1991-92,The Incometax Act contains a provision under which tax payers can avail of the facility of waiver of penalty and interest on the amount disclosed once in a lifetime.
7015,1991-92,"To those who have already availed of this facility, I propose to give just one more opportunity to disclose their unaccounted incomes."
7016,1991-92,The Finance Bill contains a proposal for making suitable amendments to section 273A of the Income tax Act for this purpose.
7017,1991-92,The Settlement Commission was set up to provide an opportunity to assessees to declare their undisclosed income and wealth.
7018,1991-92,"Under the existing procedures, the Commissioner of Income Tax can, on certain grounds, object to admission of an application by the Settlement Commission."
7019,1991-92,This results in unnecessary delay.
7020,1991-92,"This provision is, therefore, being deleted."
7021,1991-92,"The Settlement Commission will, however, continue to call for and take into account the Commissioner’s report, provided it is furnished within a period of six months."
7022,1991-92,"Our election manifesto has promised that we will promote reinvestment of profits, by suitable tax exemptions, in areas where there is crying need for massive investment such as low and middle income group housing, highways, roads and bridges, nonconventional energy, school buildings and supply of drinking water."
7023,1991-92,"I, therefore, propose to make a provision in the Incometax Act to provide deduction, in computing taxable profits of a taxpayer carrying on a business or profession, of the entire amount paid for financing projects or schemes promoting social and economic welfare."
7024,1991-92,"To ensure optimum use of scarce resources, I propose to set up a National Committee of eminent persons to identify areas requiring support and for recommending specific projects and schemes."
7025,1991-92,A similar deduction will be allowed also in the case of taxpayers not carrying on any business or profession.
7026,1991-92,"As a token of my commitment to education and research and in recognition of the significant role they have to play in our development process, I propose to 19 extend certain tax concessions that will help in the funding of social science research and provide some incentive to authors and publishers."
7027,1991-92,"At present, only taxpayers carrying on a business or profession get deduction for sums paid to any approved university, college or other institutions for research in social sciences related to the class of business carried on by them."
7028,1991-92,I consider that there is a case for providing more tax incentives for social science research.
7029,1991-92,"I, therefore, propose to allow the same100 per cent deduction in respect of sums paid for research in these areas whether related to business or not."
7030,1991-92,I also propose to allow this deduction to taxpayers not carrying on any business or profession.
7031,1991-92,"The role of books, particularly in the context of our National Literacy Mission as well as the National Education Policy cannot be overemphasized."
7032,1991-92,"To encourage publication of better and less expensive books and to give a fillip to the publishing industry, I propose to revive, with effect from the current accounting period, the deduction of twenty per cent of profits from publication of books for a period of 5 years."
7033,1991-92,To encourage the publication of quality text books in various Indian languages I also propose to revive the 25 per cent deduction from professional income of authors of text books in Indian languages.
7034,1991-92,"This will also be available for a period of five years, beginning with the current incomeearning period."
7035,1991-92,Offshore country funds are emerging as important channels for attracting foreign institutional investment particularly from non resident Indians.
7036,1991-92,India made a beginning in this direction in 1989.
7037,1991-92,"Of late, however, there are signs of diminishing interest of foreign institutional investors in offshore India country funds."
7038,1991-92,The comparative national tax structure is one of the key factors affecting the direction of international financial flow.
7039,1991-92,"I, therefore, propose to substantially reduce the rate of tax on dividend income received by the offshore funds from the units of UTI or other mutual funds and on longterm capital gains from such units."
7040,1991-92,On dividend income the proposed rate of tax will be 10 percent as against the existing rate of 25 percent.
7041,1991-92,"On longterm capital gains, I propose to have the same rate of 10 percent as against the effective rate of about 45 percent at present."
7042,1991-92,"In the light of our deep emotional involvement with the struggle of the Black majority in South Africa and as a further affirmation of our commitment to SouthSouth cooperation, I propose that donations to the AFRICA FUND be entitled to 100 per cent deduction under section 80G of the Incometax Act."
7043,1991-92,The Government is committed to the welfare of our unfortunate handicapped citizens.
7044,1991-92,"In an effort to mitigate in some small measure their hardship, I propose to increase the deduction available under Section 80 U of the Incometax Act in respect of totally blind or physically handicapped persons, from fifteen thousand rupees to twenty thousand rupees."
7045,1991-92,The benefit of this tax concession is also proposed to be extended to partially blind persons.
7046,1991-92,Promotion of housing activity ranks high in Government’s socioeconomic priorities.
7047,1991-92,"Towards this objective, I propose to extend the benefit of tax rebate under section 88 of the Incometax Act also to contractual schemes floated by public housing corporations like HUDCO and State Housing Boards along the lines of the Home Loan Account Scheme of the National Housing Bank."
7048,1991-92,"Further, the tax rebate under section 88 will also be available in relation to installment/repayment 20 of loans towards cost of land and also in cases where the house was purchased or constructed before 1st April, 1987."
7049,1991-92,Our software industry has made considerable progress in recent years.
7050,1991-92,"However, there is still a vast unexploited potential for growth."
7051,1991-92,It is time we make allout efforts to capture the overseas software market.
7052,1991-92,"With this objective, I propose to extend the tax concession under section 80HHC of the Incometax Act to export of software."
7053,1991-92,"With this concession, the exports of this industry should register rapid growth."
7054,1991-92,I also propose to extend the concession under section 80HHC to the export of processed minerals.
7055,1991-92,"I consider that scientific, technical and professional skills, knowledge and experience possessed by our professionals in various fields like architecture, accounting etc. have an increasing capacity to earn foreign exchange for the country."
7056,1991-92,Many of them carry on their professions as individuals or partnership firms.
7057,1991-92,"To enable them to benefit from the tax concession available under section 80O, I propose to extend, to the noncorporate assessees, the concession presently available only to the corporate sector."
7058,1991-92,"In order to encourage development of tourist infrastructure in regions where such facilities are almost nonexistent today, I propose to exempt from Expenditure Tax for a period of ten years expenditure incurred in new approved hotels set up in hilly and other remote areas."
7059,1991-92,"I also propose to allow to such hotels a deduction of 50 per cent from their profits instead of the normal 30 per cent under section 80I, subject to certain conditions."
7060,1991-92,"As a token of my appreciation of the role of a healthy capital market in the development of our economy, I propose to raise the basic deduction of Rs 10,000 now available under section 48 of the Incometax Act in respect of longterm capital gains to Rs 15,000. 83."
7061,1991-92,"As indicated earlier, I wish to take some positive steps to reverse the trend of decline in the proportion of direct tax revenues to total revenues."
7062,1991-92,I therefore propose to raise additional resources this year through a greater reliance on direct taxes.
7063,1991-92,I now turn to my proposals for ensuring better tax compliance and moblising revenues through the imposition of additional taxes.
7064,1991-92,"To enable the Government to identify income earners, most of whom would not otherwise declare their income or would not declare their full income, I propose to extend the scheme of tax deduction at source to cover new areas of payments in the nature of commissions, interest paid by banks on time deposits and withdrawals from the National Savings Scheme."
7065,1991-92,"To minimise the inconvenience for small depositors, tax will be deducted at source only in respect of payments in excess of Rs 2500 per year."
7066,1991-92,Those receiving payments in excess of the limit but not having taxable income will have the facility of collecting payment with no tax deduction by filing a declaration in the prescribed manner.
7067,1991-92,The present provision for offsetting shortterm capital losses against income leads to tax avoidance.
7068,1991-92,"I, therefore, propose that any loss on transfer of a capital asset will be set off only against gain from transfer of another capital asset."
7069,1991-92,This is 21 only logical.
7070,1991-92,It should also stop the practice of buying shortterm capital losses being resorted to by some unscrupulous tax payers.
7071,1991-92,"Over the years, those with an instinct for gambling have increasingly patronised the races."
7072,1991-92,"I propose to withdraw the incometax exemption of Rs 5000 in respect of earnings from races, including horse races."
7073,1991-92,I am sure that persons who place bets will now also have the added pleasure of sharing their earnings from races with the Government.
7074,1991-92,Professor Kaldor once observed that no civilised society should have a maximum marginal rate of income tax higher than 45 per cent.
7075,1991-92,"We are firmly committed to a tax system which is simple, credible, yet progressive, in which people realise that honesty is the best policy."
7076,1991-92,I expect to make a beginning in this direction as soon as we can overcome the present fiscal difficulties.
7077,1991-92,I am confident that this process can be completed before the end of the five year term of our Government.
7078,1991-92,Tax payers can help to accelerate the process of tax reform if all of them resolve to pay their incometax dues fully and promptly.
7079,1991-92,"In the midst of a fiscal crisis however, such a change is not feasible."
7080,1991-92,We must wait for better times.
7081,1991-92,"The best I can do under the circumstances, is what I propose to do this year : keep the personal incometax rate structure including the surcharge unchanged."
7082,1991-92,"That I have not added to the burden of the taxpayer is, in itself, a relief."
7083,1991-92,I have received several representations that wealthtax rates need to be rationalised.
7084,1991-92,I see considerable merit in these representations.
7085,1991-92,"However, taking into account the needs of revenue and also for want of time, I propose to make no change in the rates of wealthtax."
7086,1991-92,"For the purposes of levy of wealthtax, the rules of valuation of assets aim at capturing their market value, or near about, as on the valuation date."
7087,1991-92,I find that a distortion has crept into these rules.
7088,1991-92,When an individual holds any asset in his name its valuation is at the market value.
7089,1991-92,"However, if a group of persons holds its assets through an investment company the taxable value of these assets gets reduced considerably because it is based on the book value and not on the market value."
7090,1991-92,"I, therefore, propose to remove this anomaly by providing that in valuing unquoted shares of an investment company, the breakup value of the share will be determined after revaluing the assets of the company at their market value."
7091,1991-92,"I feel disappointed that the phenomenal growth in the output, value added and profits of the corporate sector, in recent years, has not been appropriately reflected in corporate tax collections."
7092,1991-92,"The experience of the preceding financial year, in particular, is a matter of serious concern."
7093,1991-92,"I am, therefore, raising the corporate tax rate for widely held companies, from 40 to 45 per cent."
7094,1991-92,A corresponding increase of 5 percentage points from 45 to 50 per cent is being made in the corporate tax rate for closely held companies.
7095,1991-92,I also propose to continue the existing surcharge of 15 per cent.
7096,1991-92,The traditional distinction in corporate tax rates between trading companies and industrial companies has outlived its utility.
7097,1991-92,I therefore propose to remove this distinction.
7098,1991-92,I recognise that in the medium term the rates and structure of corporate taxation have to be consistent with the needs of an economy aiming to become internationally competitive.
7099,1991-92,I shall attend to this task as soon as we have overcome the present fiscal crisis.
7100,1991-92,"In our economy, labour is abundant and capital is scarce."
7101,1991-92,These economic realities have to be reflected in our fiscal policy.
7102,1991-92,"Yet, over the years, the Indian economy has witnessed a disturbing shift towards greater capital intensity in production."
7103,1991-92,"This has led to distortion and avoidable hardship in cases where labour is replaced, or employment potential reduced, by resort to capital intensive methods of production, even in cases where such a shift is not justified on other economic and technical considerations."
7104,1991-92,Fiscal incentives have been conducive to such a shift.
7105,1991-92,"While there can be no compromise with the imperatives of technological upgradation and continuous modernisation, the tendency towards excessive capital intensity in our industry must be checked."
7106,1991-92,"The rates for depreciation prescribed in 1987, in relation to plant and machinery, are far too generous and provide much more than is needed to compensate for wear and tear."
7107,1991-92,These rates of depreciation do not reflect the true economic life of business assets.
7108,1991-92,An asset would be almost fully written off in six years at the present rate of 33.33 per cent applicable to the bulk of plant and machinery.
7109,1991-92,"I think an eight year period would be more reasonable taking into account the pace of technological change in India, the true economic life of the business assets, and the need to discourage tax induced replacement of assets."
7110,1991-92,"Therefore, I propose to reduce the general rate of depreciation for machinery and plant from 33.33 per cent to 25 per cent."
7111,1991-92,"I also propose to reduce the rate of depreciation for aeroplanes, motor buses, motor taxis and some other equipments from 50 per cent to 40 per cent, which would mean almost complete recoupment of cost in six, instead of five years."
7112,1991-92,"However, to encourage use of energy saving devices and renewable energy devices, I propose to continue to provide 100 per cent depreciation on such items of plant and machinery as also some others."
7113,1991-92,"Further, I also propose to restrict the rates of depreciation to 50 per cent of the normal rates of depreciation in cases where the asset is used for less than 6 months in a year."
7114,1991-92,Tax support to special institutions may be necessary in their nascent stage.
7115,1991-92,"However, it should not be extended in perpetuity."
7116,1991-92,Such institutions must strive to become selfreliant.
7117,1991-92,"The Industrial Development Bank of India IDBI has been enjoying complete tax exemption in respect of its income since its inception, unlike other public financial institutions."
7118,1991-92,"I propose to withdraw this tax exemption, which is no longer necessary."
7119,1991-92,"In 1987, the Government had introduced a tax on ostentatious expenditure."
7120,1991-92,It is in the form of a tax of 20 per cent of expenditure incurred in hotels where the room rent exceeds Rs 400 per day.
7121,1991-92,I propose to extend the coverage of this tax to the expenditure incurred in restaurants providing superior facilities like air conditioning.
7122,1991-92,This tax will be levied at the rate of 15 per cent of such expenditure.
7123,1991-92,"In view of the binding fiscal constraints and the need to mobilise resources, I propose to revive the interesttax which was first introduced in 1974 and withdrawn in 1978, reintroduced in a modified form in 1980 and finally withdrawn in 1985."
7124,1991-92,"I am enlarging, slightly, the coverage of this tax."
7125,1991-92,"The new tax will be levied on the gross amount of interest received by all banks, financial institutions and non banking financial companies in the corporate sector on loans and advances made in India."
7126,1991-92,These institutions would reimburse themselves by making necessary adjustments in the interest rates charged from borrowers.
7127,1991-92,The proposed tax is 23 expected to raise the cost of borrowing and yield revenue to the Government.
7128,1991-92,"It should, therefore, have both monetary and fiscal impact."
7129,1991-92,"The proposed tax will be levied at the rate of 3 per cent of the gross amount of interest earned by banks, financial institutions and financial companies on loans and advances made in India."
7130,1991-92,Interest received on transactions between the various credit institutions will be exempted from the proposed tax.
7131,1991-92,"The proposed tax will operate prospectively and interest accruing before 1st October, 1991 will not be taxed."
7132,1991-92,The proposed tax will be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income under the Incometax Act.
7133,1991-92,I do not propose to take up the time of the House with other minor changes in the Direct Tax Laws.
7134,1991-92,"Of this amount, Rs 97 crores will accrue to the States."
7135,1991-92,"In order to attract larger inflows of foreign exchange, I propose to introduce two schemes."
7136,1991-92,"Even if the remittance is received as a gift by the donee in India, it would not be subjected to gift tax."
7137,1991-92,The source of funds out of which the remittances are made would not be subject to scrutiny under the Direct Tax Laws and Exchange Control Regulations.
7138,1991-92,"In other words, I propose to provide immunity for such remittances under these laws."
7139,1991-92,The provisions of Direct Tax Laws will apply in the normal manner to the rupee proceeds of these remittances.
7140,1991-92,The scheme will come into immediate effect and will be open until close of business on 30th November 1991.
7141,1991-92,The details of the scheme will be announced by the Reserve Bank of India.
7142,1991-92,I also propose to introduce the necessary legislation in this regard as early as possible before this House.
7143,1991-92,These bonds will be available for purchase by nonresident Indians and their overseas corporate bodies.
7144,1991-92,There will be no ceiling for investment in these bonds which will have a maturity period of five years.
7145,1991-92,The bonds will be fully transferable among nonresident Indians.
7146,1991-92,Interest from the bonds will be exempt from income tax.
7147,1991-92,The bond itself would also be exempt from wealth tax until maturity.
7148,1991-92,"For the nonresident holder, the face value of the bond and the interest thereon would be repatriable with exchange rate protection."
7149,1991-92,"The bonds can also be gifted to residents, who would be provided with amnesty and immunity, as in the first scheme for inward remittances."
7150,1991-92,Such amnesty and immunity will be available only to the first resident donee.
7151,1991-92,The gift would be exempt from gift tax.
7152,1991-92,"The resident donee bond holder would also be entitled to exchange rate protection, and the same exemption from income tax and wealth tax, until maturity, but the proceeds will be paid only in rupees in India and would not be remittable abroad."
7153,1991-92,The bonds will be available for sale at all important branches of the State Bank of India abroad until close of business on 30th November 1991.
7154,1991-92,I would also bring before this House the necessary legislation at the earliest.
7155,1991-92,"In keeping with the promises made in the election manifesto of our 24 party, we have also to ensure that prices of essential commodities and goods used by the common man are kept well under check."
7156,1991-92,Conspicuous consumption must be curbed and the burden of taxation should be borne by the more affluent sections of the society.
7157,1991-92,"In the light of these imperatives, I have attempted to structure the proposals for customs and excise levies in a manner that indigenous industries are encouraged, and, at the same time, imports of items required for export production are not thwarted."
7158,1991-92,"In the long term, if revenues are buoyant and tax compliance improves, I expect to bring down the rates of customs and excise levies."
7159,1991-92,"Even now, some moderation in import duties is being attempted and a more broadbased effort may be attempted to streamline the structure and reduce the rates in the next budget."
7160,1991-92,"I have also tried to ensure that the proposed changes improve competitiveness of the industrial sector, particularly the export oriented industries."
7161,1991-92,"Given the paucity of time, it has not been possible to undertake such an exercise in this budget, but we should be able to formulate concrete measures soon as a part of structural reforms in the tax system."
7162,1991-92,"This escalates costs, fuels inflation and is regressive in its impact."
7163,1991-92,"Therefore, I have not relied on indirect taxes as the major source of resource mobilisation."
7164,1991-92,"Indeed, the overall impact of my proposals for customs and excise levies is revenue negative in so far as the Central Government is concerned."
7165,1991-92,"As a measure of reform, I propose to reduce the ad valorem rate of basic plus auxiliary duties of customs to a maximum of 150 per cent where it is more than that at present, thereby eliminating the tariff peaks above 150 per cent."
7166,1991-92,The only exceptions that would remain hereafter are imported alcoholic beverages and passenger baggage.
7167,1991-92,The revenue loss on this account would be Rs 132 crores in a full year.
7168,1991-92,The increase was not quite rational and was asymmetric in its incidence.
7169,1991-92,"In some cases, the auxiliary duty went up by 20 percentage points  from 5 per cent to 25 per cent and from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, while in some others, by just 5 percentage points i. e., from 45 per cent to 50 per cent."
7170,1991-92,"This steep and uneven increase imposed a very high burden of duties on certain items, and also led to distortions in the overall rate structure."
7171,1991-92,"In order to remove the anomalies which had been created and rationalise rates of duties, I propose to give a duty relief of 10 percentage points to almost every item which suffered an increase of 20 percentage points."
7172,1991-92,"Moreover, on certain items, which are important from the point of view of environmental protection, export promotion, saving of foreign exchange and so on, I propose to roll back the rates to levels prevailing before 15th December, 1990."
7173,1991-92,"These items include waste paper, wood in the rough, jigat used in the manufacture of Agarbattis, ethylene, machinery for fuel injection equipment and certain items of machinery for printing and the newspaper 25 industry."
7174,1991-92,These proposals will result in a revenue loss of Rs 472 crores in a full year.
7175,1991-92,"While I cannot make a substantial reduction at this stage because of the revenue implications, which are considerable, I propose to reduce the level of duties from 85 per cent to 80 per cent."
7176,1991-92,"In tandem, the rate of duty on their components is also being reduced by 5 percentage points, from the existing levels of 65 or 70 percent."
7177,1991-92,This proposal would mean a revenue loss of Rs  167 crores in a full year.
7178,1991-92,"Under this scheme, fiscal relief was provided on import of capital equipment for the manufacture of power generation equipment, paper machinery, textile machinery and many others to promote domestic production of such machinery."
7179,1991-92,The scheme has been instrumental in bringing about considerable improvement in the quality of machines produced in India.
7180,1991-92,"In order to give a further thrust to the scheme, I propose to expand the list of machinery items which will now attract a concessional duty of 50 per cent."
7181,1991-92,The revenue loss on this account is estimated at Rs  5 crores in a full year.
7182,1991-92,I would now like to outline some fiscal measures which will give a further boost to the export effort.
7183,1991-92,"However, the present stipulation, that excise duty payable must be equal to the import duty, has proved to be a deterrent."
7184,1991-92,These units have to be fostered if they are to compete effectively in the international market; for this purpose they should not be prevented from creating a niche in the domestic market.
7185,1991-92,"Accordingly, I propose to reduce the excise duty on the goods, permitted to be sold in the domestic market under the scheme, to a level which would be equivalent to half the import duty leviable on such goods subject, inter alia, to the condition that the duty would not be less than the excise duty levied on similar items produced in the domestic tariff area."
7186,1991-92,I propose to extend the duty concession to a few more items of such machinery.
7187,1991-92,"Out of my concern for the welfare of our fishermen, I also propose to fully exempt from excise duty specified yarns which are generally used for making fishnets."
7188,1991-92,The duty on isocyanates is being reduced from 120 per cent to 40 per cent.
7189,1991-92,"The import duty on two important leather preservatives, namely TCMTB and PCMC, is being reduced from over 150 per cent to 50 per cent."
7190,1991-92,These preservatives will replace certain other chemicals which are suspected to have carcinogenic effects.
7191,1991-92,"I also propose to extend the concessional duty, available at 26 present to specified capital goods required by the leather industry to a few more items of such machinery."
7192,1991-92,The jewelry made therefrom also has a significant export potential.
7193,1991-92,"In order to encourage indigenous manufacture of cubic zirconium, I propose to reduce the import duty on the raw materials viz."
7194,1991-92,Government attaches the highest priority to agriculture.
7195,1991-92,"One of the promises made in our election manifesto is to provide a massive thrust to food processing and other agrobased industries, in an endeavour to increase the income of farmers, create employment opportunities, diversify the rural economy and foster rural industrialisation."
7196,1991-92,"As an important step in this direction, I propose to exempt agrobased products such as sauces, ketchup, butter, cheese, skimmed milk powder, vegetable oils, jams, jellies and juices, canned fruits and dried vegetables, certain soya products, starches and preparations of meat and fish from excise duties altogether."
7197,1991-92,"I am doing so to promote the diversification of our agricultural economy, to increase the farmers’ share of the consumer’s income spent on processed agricultural products, to promote rural industrialisation based on agricultural produce and to encourage the adoption of modern postharvest technologies."
7198,1991-92,"The measures I have proposed, I expect, will also lead to some reduction in consumer prices of such products, providing relief to the harassed consumers in a period of rising prices."
7199,1991-92,The revenue loss will be Rs 84 crores but I am convinced that the overall gain to the economy will more than offset the loss to the exchequer.
7200,1991-92,I propose to extend the duty concession to a few more bulk pesticides and pesticide intermediates.
7201,1991-92,The proposals involve a revenue loss of about Rs 11 crores in a full year.
7202,1991-92,I propose to increase the money credit of Rs 640 per metric ton that is currently available in respect of rice bran oil used in the manufacture of soap to Rs  1000 per metric ton.
7203,1991-92,"In addition, I propose to include some more nonconventional oils and solvent extracted oils in the scheme."
7204,1991-92,This would also help in generating more employment for our tribal women.
7205,1991-92,These proposals involve a revenue sacrifice of about Rs 10 crores in a full year.
7206,1991-92,"The scheme has been well received by the industry, and there have been persistent demands for its extension to other areas."
7207,1991-92,"I propose to reintroduce the scheme in respect of aerated waters, and also to extend it to cover manmade fibres and filament yarns in respect of their inputs."
7208,1991-92,"While extending the scheme to fibres and yarns, I do not propose to raise the duty on those fibres and yarns on which the duty was increased as recently as December, 1990."
7209,1991-92,"On other fibres and yarns, the duty rates have been adjusted with a view to retaining the collection of excise duties at the earlier level."
7210,1991-92,But duties on polypropylene 27 monofilament and multifilament yarns are being increased to raise additional revenue.
7211,1991-92,"In respect of aerated waters also, I do not propose any increase in duty."
7212,1991-92,The proposals involve a revenue loss of about Rs 230 crores in a full year.
7213,1991-92,I expect that the benefit would be passed on to the consumers in the form of reduced prices.
7214,1991-92,"As an antievasion measure, I also propose to charge additional excise duty on cotton fabrics containing 40 per cent or less of polyester at the same rates as applicable to cotton fabrics containing more than 40 per cent of polyester."
7215,1991-92,The proposals involve a revenue gain of about Rs  23 crores in a full year.
7216,1991-92,"At present, some drug intermediates and bulk drugs carry a concessional rate of import duty."
7217,1991-92,"I wish to extend the concession to a few more drug intermediates and bulk drugs, and grant concessions in excise duties to a few more drug intermediates."
7218,1991-92,"At present, footwear of value not exceeding Rs 100 per pair manufactured in rural areas by registered cooperative societies, women’s societies or by institutions recognised by KVIC, are fully exempted."
7219,1991-92,I propose to raise the value limit of exemption to Rs  150 per pair.
7220,1991-92,"Further, I propose to extend to synthetic detergents the benefit of full exemption from excise duty that is presently available to specified products when manufactured in rural areas by registered cooperative societies, women’s societies, institutions recognised by KVIC etc."
7221,1991-92,"In view of our dwindling forest cover, we must conserve our scarce resources."
7222,1991-92,"Therefore, as I have stated earlier, the import duty on waste paper and wood in the rough is proposed to be rolled back to the rates that were prevailing before 15th December, 1990."
7223,1991-92,"I also propose to fully exempt from excise duty aluminium doors, windows and their frames so as to encourage the use of aluminium in the place of wood in construction activities."
7224,1991-92,Fly ash is a pollutant.
7225,1991-92,"It can, however, be put to productive use in the manufacture of bricks and other construction materials."
7226,1991-92,"In order to encourage such use, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty various building components containing more than 25 per cent of fly ash or phosphogypsum."
7227,1991-92,I also propose to exempt phosphogypsum which is one of the byeproducts of the fertilizer industry from excise duty to encourage its use by farmers.
7228,1991-92,"To perform the onerous task before me, I need support from the Press."
7229,1991-92,"As a gesture of goodwill, I propose to exempt standard newsprint from import duty which is, at present, Rs  450 per metric ton."
7230,1991-92,I have already proposed to bring down the rates of import duty on certain specified machinery and equipment required by the printing and newspaper industry to the levels that were obtaining before 15th December 1990.
7231,1991-92,"The monetary limit of duty free import of photographic goods by accredited cameramen of the Press is being raised from the present level of Rs  30,000 to Rs  60,000."
7232,1991-92,These proposals involve a revenue loss of over Rs  9 crores in a full year.
7233,1991-92,This has quite naturally made my wife very unhappy.
7234,1991-92,The House will agree that it is not good for the health of our economy if the Finance Minister of the country has strained relations with his own finance minister at home.
7235,1991-92,"I propose that the total exemption from payment of excise duty currently available to utensils made of aluminium, copper and stainless steel be extended to certain other household items particularly tiffin boxes."
7236,1991-92,"Mindful of the need for peace at home and also taking into account the labour intensive nature of the manufacture of glassware by the mouth blown process, I propose to reduce the excise duty on such glassware to 15 per cent uniformly."
7237,1991-92,Some people may not applaud my action.
7238,1991-92,But I am sure most housewives harassed by the ever rising price level will appreciate my action.
7239,1991-92,"Of the items listed in the manifesto, at present, there is no excise duty on salt, cycles, newsprint, post cards, inland letters and envelopes, and certain varieties of stoves."
7240,1991-92,Cotton sarees and dhoties attract only additional excise duty in lieu of sales tax which accrues wholly to the State Governments.
7241,1991-92,I have earlier proposed to fully exempt edible oils from excise duty.
7242,1991-92,"Electric bulbs of upto 60 watts, are already exempt from excise duty."
7243,1991-92,"I now propose to fully exempt electric bulbs, of higher wattage, which presently attract a duty of Re. 1 per bulb, from the payment of excise duty."
7244,1991-92,"Energy efficient chulhas, too, would be exempted from excise duty."
7245,1991-92,I also propose to reduce the excise duty on two wheelers of engine capacity exceeding 50 cc but not exceeding 75 cc from 20 per cent to 15 per cent.
7246,1991-92,"In pursuit of this objective, I propose to invite the representatives of industry and trade to sit together with our Government to work out modalities as to how best we can contribute to the realisation of the price objectives listed in our election manifesto, for the benefit of the common man."
7247,1991-92,I propose to raise it to 10 per cent.
7248,1991-92,"Since the increase is only a percentage of the basic excise duty, the impact of the additional levy would be minimal on prices."
7249,1991-92,"For instance, in respect of any article on which the basic excise 29 duty is say, 20 percent, the increase would be only 1 percent of the value."
7250,1991-92,"Tea, coffee, sugar, kerosene, matches, and vanaspati, being items of mass consumption, would remain exempt from special excise duty."
7251,1991-92,"In addition, I am ensuring that the increase in special excise duty will not apply to diesel and two wheelers."
7252,1991-92,"The proposal involves a revenue gain of Rs  1010 crores in a full year, a substantial portion of which will accrue to the States."
7253,1991-92,"In pursuance of this, I propose to increase the excise duty rates on refrigerators, airconditioners including compressors, motor cars, audio and video cassette tapes, video cassettes, picture tubes, colour television sets, VCRs and VCPs."
7254,1991-92,I also propose to raise the excise duty on compressors for air conditioners of a capacity not exceeding 7.5 metric ton by Rs  1800.
7255,1991-92,The expected additional revenue from these proposals is about Rs 91 crores in a full year.
7256,1991-92,I propose to increase the excise duty to 60 per cent.
7257,1991-92,"The duty on taxis at 30 per cent will, however, remain unchanged."
7258,1991-92,The proposal will yield an additional revenue of Rs 150 crores per year.
7259,1991-92,The estimated revenue gain from the proposal will be Rs 29 crores in a full year.
7260,1991-92,I propose to raise the excise duty on colour picture tubes as well.
7261,1991-92,I am exempting all black and white television sets from excise duty and shifting the burden to picture tubes.
7262,1991-92,"I also propose to increase excise duty on VHS type VCRs and VCPs by Rs 400 per set and Rs  250 per set, respectively, and on other types of VCRs and VCPs, from 25 per cent to 30 per cent."
7263,1991-92,The revenue gain on this account is Rs  66 crores in a full year.
7264,1991-92,"Finance Minister has to do his bit to curb smoking, which is injurious to health."
7265,1991-92,I must also fall in line and add to the tax on cigarettes.
7266,1991-92,"In respect of non filter cigarettes, I propose to raise the duties by Rs 10 to Rs 25 per thousand cigarettes depending upon the length."
7267,1991-92,"In respect of filter cigarettes, the increase will be between Rs 35 and Rs 125 per thousand cigarettes."
7268,1991-92,"However, filter cigarettes exceeding 85 mm will attract the ceiling rate prescribed in the excise tariff."
7269,1991-92,This will give us additional revenue to the extent of Rs  300 crores in a full year.
7270,1991-92,"Although the duties on cigarettes have been increased almost every year, excise duties on biris have remained unchanged since 1986."
7271,1991-92,I feel that biri smokers should not be denied the opportunity of increasing their share of contribution to the national exchequer.
7272,1991-92,"I accordingly propose to increase the duty on handmade branded biris, other than paper rolled biris to Rs 4.50 per thousand."
7273,1991-92,Paper rolled biris will attract a duty of Rs 10 per thousand.
7274,1991-92,"The present exemption on other 30 hand made biris would, however, continue."
7275,1991-92,The expected additional revenue is Rs 33 crores in a full year.
7276,1991-92,I propose to raise the excise duty on the same by Rs 5 and Rs 10 per kg.
7277,1991-92,This involves a revenue gain of Rs 4 crores in a full year.
7278,1991-92,"In ad valorem terms, the present incidence of excise duty on levy sugar is more than the incidence on free sale sugar."
7279,1991-92,"In order to correct the situation, I propose to increase the excise duty on free sale sugar from the present level of Rs 50 to Rs 71 per quintal."
7280,1991-92,This would mean an additional tax burden of 21 paise per kilogram of free sale sugar which costs about Rs 10 per kg in the market place.
7281,1991-92,This proposal is expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 122 crores in a full year.
7282,1991-92,I would like to make it clear that I am not proposing any increase in excise duty on levy sugar which is sold through the public distribution system.
7283,1991-92,"The State Governments will be free to levy sales tax on khandsari sugar, if they so desire."
7284,1991-92,A substantial portion of molasses is used in the manufacture of liquor.
7285,1991-92,"In the circumstances, it can bear a higher rate of duty."
7286,1991-92,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the excise duty on molasses to Rs 150 per metric ton."
7287,1991-92,The estimated revenue gain from the proposal is Rs 13 crores in a year.
7288,1991-92,These include certain consequential amendments to the customs tariff based on the amendments to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System which has been adopted by our country in terms of the International Convention on the Harmonised System.
7289,1991-92,The amendments are merely enabling provisions and do not have significant revenue implications.
7290,1991-92,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
7291,1991-92,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
7292,1991-92,"The net revenue gain from excise duties is thus Rs 1440.94 crores in a full year, of which the States will get Rs 750.04 crores leaving the balance of Rs 690.90 crores for the Centre."
7293,1991-92,The proposals in regard to changes in the customs duties imply a revenue loss of Rs 822.52 crores and a revenue gain of Rs 78.00 crores in a full year.
7294,1991-92,The net impact of the proposals relating to customs duties is a loss of Rs 744.52 crores in a full year.
7295,1991-92,"Thus, as compared with the additional net revenue of Rs 696.42 crores from customs and excise duties, the States would gain Rs 750.04 crores, while the Centre would lose Rs  53.62 crores in a full year."
7296,1991-92,Rs 2042 crores to the Centre.
7297,1991-92,My proposals in regard to customs duties will involve a net revenue loss of Rs 510 crores in the current year while those relating to Union excise duties are estimated to yield a net additional revenue of Rs  988 crores in the remaining part of the current year of which Rs  515 crores will be the share of States and Rs  473 crores will be retained by the Centre.
7298,1991-92,"Taking both direct and indirect taxes into account, the net gain to the Centre in the current year is estimated at Rs  2005 crores and with this, the budgetary deficit of the Centre for the current year is estimated at Rs  7719 crores, the revenue deficit at Rs  13854 crores and the fiscal deficit at Rs  37727 crores."
7299,1991-92,"Before I conclude, let me end on a personal note."
7300,1991-92,"Years ago, in a letter which Jawaharlal Nehru wrote to the young Indira Gandhi, he advised her that in dealing with the affairs of the State one should be full of sentiment but never be sentimental."
7301,1991-92,But the House will forgive me if on an occasion like this I cannot avoid being somewhat sentimental.
7302,1991-92,University scholarships and grants made it possible for me to go to college in India as well as in England.
7303,1991-92,This country has honoured me by appointing me to some of the most important public offices of our sovereign Republic.
7304,1991-92,This is a debt which I can never be able to fully repay.
7305,1991-92,The best I can do is to pledge myself to serve our country with utmost sincerity and dedication.
7306,1991-92,This I promise to the House.
7307,1991-92,A Finance Minister has to be hard headed.
7308,1991-92,This I shall endeavour to be.
7309,1991-92,I shall be firm when it comes to defending the interests of this nation.
7310,1991-92,But I promise that in dealing with the people of India I shall be soft hearted.
7311,1991-92,I shall not in any way renege on our nation’s firm and irrevocable commitment to the pursuit of equity and social justice.
7312,1991-92,I shall never forget that ultimately all economic processes are meant to serve the interests of our people.
7313,1991-92,"It is only through a commitment to social justice and the pursuit of excellence that we can mobilise the collective will of our people for development, to give it a high moral purpose and to keep alive the spirit of national solidarity."
7314,1991-92,"The massive social and economic reforms needed to remove the scourge of poverty, ignorance and disease can succeed only if backed by a spirit of high idealism, self sacrifice and dedication."
7315,1991-92,We are fully prepared for that role.
7316,1991-92,Our party will provide an effective Government to our country.
7317,1991-92,Our people are our masters.
7318,1991-92,We see the role of our Government as one of empowering our people to realize their full potential.
7319,1991-92,"This budget constitutes a vital component of a comprehensive vision, a well thought out strategy and an effective action programme designed to get India moving once again."
7320,1991-92,"But as Victor Hugo once said, “no power on earth can stop an idea whose time has come.”"
7321,1991-92,I suggest to this august House that the emergence of India as a major economic power in the world happens to be one such idea.
7322,1991-92,Let the whole world hear it loud and clear.
7323,1991-92,India is now wide awake.
7324,1992-93,The fiscal year now drawing to a close has been a difficult one by any standards.
7325,1992-93,It has been a year of crisis and of crisis management.
7326,1992-93,It has also been a year of great economic challenges and bold new initiatives.
7327,1992-93,"Honourable Members would recall that when the new Government assumed office eight months ago, we inherited an economy on the verge of collapse."
7328,1992-93,The balance of payments was in serious trouble.
7329,1992-93,The foreign exchange reserves were barely enough for two weeks of imports.
7330,1992-93,Foreign commercial banks had stopped lending to India.
7331,1992-93,NonResident Indians were withdrawing their deposits.
7332,1992-93,"Shortages of foreign exchange had forced a massive import squeeze, which had halted the rapid industrial growth of earlier years and had produced negative growth rates from May 1991 onwards."
7333,1992-93,This is the grim legacy we inherited.
7334,1992-93,Our first and immediate challenge was to arrest the slide and restore India’s credibility both domestically and in the eyes of the world.
7335,1992-93,"To achieve this objective we had to take immediate measures to avert a default in international payments and also take steps to restore macroeconomic balance in the economy in the short run, with a view to controlling inflation and reducing the balance of payments deficit to a manageable level."
7336,1992-93,Our medium term objective was to place the economy back on the path of high and sustainable growth.
7337,1992-93,The new Government took several initiatives in pursuit of these objectives.
7338,1992-93,"We took emergency measures to prevent a default in external payments, which would have been highly disruptive."
7339,1992-93,The previous Government had already decided to use a part of the gold held by the Reserve Bank of India to mobilise temporary liquidity abroad.
7340,1992-93,We did not consider it prudent to reverse this decision.
7341,1992-93,But we promised to redeem the gold at the earliest opportunity and we have kept our word.
7342,1992-93,We began the process of restoring macroeconomic balance by seeking to reduce the fiscal deficit which had grown very large in the previous year.
7343,1992-93,"We also embarked on a medium term programme of structural reform, including new initiatives in trade policy and industrial policy aimed at improving the efficiency, productivity and international competitiveness of Indian industry."
7344,1992-93,"Our longer term objective is to evolve a pattern of production which is labour intensive and generates larger employment opportunities in productive higher income jobs, and reduces the disparities in income and wealth between rural and urban areas."
7345,1992-93,"Agricultural production was below target in the kharif season, but prospects for the rabi crop look good."
7346,1992-93,Industrial production suffered because of severe import compression and tight credit conditions.
7347,1992-93,"However, the infrastructure sectors, which are the foundation on which future industrial growth depends, have done well."
7348,1992-93,"Overall, I expect GDP growth in 199192 to be around 2.5%."
7349,1992-93,"I expect a distinct improvement in 199293, and a return to high growth in 199394."
7350,1992-93,"However, this revival can be achieved only if we persevere unflinchingly with the process of stabilisation and economic reform begun in the current year."
7351,1992-93,"Stabilisation and structural adjustment are never painless or quick, especially when we are dealing with imbalances and structural rigidities which have built up over several years."
7352,1992-93,"It will take sustained effort, over at least three years, to bring the economy back to a path of rapid and sustainable growth."
7353,1992-93,"A firm commitment to austerity, the pursuit of excellence and the promotion of efficiency and productivity for the benefit of the common people has to be an integral part of this effort."
7354,1992-93,"Given our limited resources, our people cannot afford to copy the soulless consumerism and the wasteful life styles of the affluent countries of the West."
7355,1992-93,Conspicuous consumption has to be actively discouraged.
7356,1992-93,The virtues of thrift have to be emphasised.
7357,1992-93,"The owners of wealth, as Gandhiji used to say, must learn to regard themselves as trustees of society."
7358,1992-93,"We cannot postpone structural reform and adjustment, but we must ensure that the burden of adjustment on the poorer and weaker sections of our society is ameliorated to the maximum possible extent."
7359,1992-93,"We are travelling through difficult and uncharted terrain, where no action is without attendant risks, and success will not always be immediate."
7360,1992-93,"We need patience, perseverance and national cohesion if we are to succeed."
7361,1992-93,It has been alleged by some people that the reform programme has been dictated by the IMF and the World Bank.
7362,1992-93,We are founder members of these two institutions and it is our right to borrow from them when we need assistance in support of our programmes.
7363,1992-93,"As lenders, they are required to satisfy themselves about our capacity to repay loans and this is where conditionality comes into the picture."
7364,1992-93,All borrowing countries hold discussions with these institutions on the viability of the programmes for which assistance is sought.
7365,1992-93,We have also held such discussions.
7366,1992-93,The extent of conditionality depends on the amount and the type of assistance sought.
7367,1992-93,"However, I wish to state categorically that the conditions we have accepted reflect no more than the implementation of the reform programme as outlined in my letters of intent sent to the IMF and the World Bank, and are wholly consistent with our national interests."
7368,1992-93,The bulk of the reform programme is based on the election manifesto of our Party.
7369,1992-93,"There is no question of the Government ever compromising our national interests, not to speak of our sovereignty."
7370,1992-93,"Although the full fruit of our policies will take time to materialise, I am happy to report to the House that we have made substantial progress even in this short space of eight months."
7371,1992-93,We have achieved our most immediate objective of restoring India’s credibility and pulling the economy back from the slide into financial chaos.
7372,1992-93,"Our foreign exchange reserves have been rebuilt to about Rs 11,000 crores."
7373,1992-93,NonResident Indians are no longer withdrawing their deposits.
7374,1992-93,"We have successfully concluded arrangements with multilateral financing institutions such as the IMF, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank to obtain quick disbursing funds to support the balance of payments in the current year."
7375,1992-93,"Inflation remains a difficult problem, and one to which we attach the highest priority, because inflation hurts the poor and the fixed income earner most of all."
7376,1992-93,"Inflation was accelerating in June 1991, when our Government came to power, and the annual rate of inflation reached a peak of 16.7% in August 1991."
7377,1992-93,"Since then, the rate of inflation has come down to about 12%, but I am painfully conscious that this is still far too high."
7378,1992-93,We are determined to bring inflation under control.
7379,1992-93,This is why the Budget for 199192 focussed on the need for fiscal discipline.
7380,1992-93,"I am confident that as we persevere with fiscal discipline in 199293, and this we must do if we want to bring prices under control, the rate of inflation will come down substantially in the coming fiscal year."
7381,1992-93,Our ability to fight inflation has been considerably enhanced by the improvement in our foreign exchange reserves.
7382,1992-93,"This has enabled us to relax the restrictions imposed last year on imports, thus ensuring near normal availability of essential imports in the months ahead."
7383,1992-93,This will help production and ease inflationary pressure.
7384,1992-93,The comfortable reserves position has also given the Government greater flexibility to finance additional imports of essential items to deal with shortages and break inflationary expectations.
7385,1992-93,The Government will remain fully vigilant on the prices front and will use the Public Distribution System to counter inflation and in particular to protect the poorer sections of the population from high prices and shortages.
7386,1992-93,The Prime Minister announced on 1st January this year the launching of the revamped Public Distribution System in about 1700 of the most backward blocks of the country.
7387,1992-93,We are determined to ensure that foodgrains and essential commodities reach the poor and the underprivileged in adequate quantities and at affordable prices.
7388,1992-93,"Next to inflation, our major problem in the short term is the management of the balance of payments."
7389,1992-93,"We have averted collapse and gained some flexibility, but a sustained improvement in our external payments position requires much more."
7390,1992-93,"Our export earnings have suffered badly this year, mainly because of the disruption of trade with the former Soviet Union, and also because of recessionary conditions in world markets."
7391,1992-93,"As a result, we have not been able to finance our normal import requirements."
7392,1992-93,There are some who argue that all we need to do to solve our balance of payments problem is to compress our imports.
7393,1992-93,I would like to point out that import compression has already been carried to the extreme and any further compression can only be at the cost of both growth and employment.
7394,1992-93,Imports of nonessential consumer goods should certainly continue to be discouraged.
7395,1992-93,"However, we must recognise that the only lasting solution to our balance of payments problem lies not in compressing imports but in a rapid expansion of exports."
7396,1992-93,"A growing economy 4 needs a growing volume of imports of fuel, and other industrial inputs and also of capital goods embodying modern technology."
7397,1992-93,"This is not to deny the importance of selfreliance, but selfreliance in today’s world of integrated global markets cannot be achieved merely by reducing import dependence and insulating the economy from the world."
7398,1992-93,Following that path will only lead to more import controls and promote inefficiency and corruption.
7399,1992-93,It will perpetuate an environment in which Indian entrepreneurs will not have the flexibility they need to compete with other developing countries in world markets.
7400,1992-93,"The resulting inability to export will actually make us more, rather than less, dependent on the outside world."
7401,1992-93,"Our vision of a selfreliant economy should be of an economy which can meet all its import requirements through exports, without undue dependence on artificial external props such as foreign aid."
7402,1992-93,"I suggest to this august House that this is precisely the vision of selfreliance as bequeathed to us by Jawaharlal Nehru as elaborated in the Third Five Year Plan, and translated to the realities of today’s world."
7403,1992-93,"While introducing the new trade policy last year, Government had indicated that it would be our objective to move towards convertibility of the rupee on the current account."
7404,1992-93,The achievement of convertibility is a sign of economic strength and true self reliance.
7405,1992-93,We are now ready to take the next important step in this direction by introducing a new system of partial convertibility.
7406,1992-93,The new system is designed to provide a powerful boost to our exports as well as to efficient import substitution.
7407,1992-93,It will further reduce the scope for bureaucratic controls which contribute to both inefficiency and corruption.
7408,1992-93,It will also greatly reduce the incentive for illegal transactions in foreign exchange.
7409,1992-93,"Under the new system all foreign exchange remittances, whether earned through exports of goods or services, or remittances, will be converted into rupees in the following manner: 40% of the foreign exchange remitted will be converted at the official exchange rate while the remaining 60% will be converted at a market determined rate."
7410,1992-93,"The foreign exchange surrendered at official exchange rates will be available to meet the foreign exchange requirements of essential imports such as petroleum and oil products, fertilisers, defence and life saving drugs."
7411,1992-93,"All other imports of raw materials, components and also capital goods will be made freely importable on open General Licence but the foreign exchange for these imports will have to be obtained from the market."
7412,1992-93,"There will be a specified ‘negative list’ of raw materials, components and capital goods which will continue to be importable only against licences."
7413,1992-93,There will be no change in the import policy for consumer goods which will remain restricted as at present.
7414,1992-93,"Foreign exchange required for other payments on private account including travel, debt service payments, dividends, royalties and other remittances will also have to be obtained at the market rate."
7415,1992-93,The new system will replace the system of Eximscrips.
7416,1992-93,There will be no need to issue Eximscrips for each export transaction as the new system will operate through the banks.
7417,1992-93,"Instead of a premium on Eximscrips, exporters will have the benefit of the premium on 60% of their earnings in the foreign exchange market."
7418,1992-93,"What is more, the incentive for earning foreign exchange will now be available to remittances from our workers abroad."
7419,1992-93,"There is no reason why our workers, who earn foreign exchange by the sweat of their hard labour abroad, should be denied incentives presently given to exporters of goods and professional services."
7420,1992-93,I salute our workers from Kerala and other states working abroad.
7421,1992-93,What I have announced today is a small token of our appreciation of their magnificent contribution to India’s foreign exchange earnings.
7422,1992-93,"With these changes we will have achieved a major simplification of trade policy, eliminating licensing and the associated bureaucratic delays and inefficiencies over a wide range of items."
7423,1992-93,We will also have introduced a selfbalancing system to manage a large part of the balance of payments.
7424,1992-93,The total volume of imports will be automatically regulated by the available volume of foreign exchange.
7425,1992-93,Scarcity of foreign exchange will be reflected in a premium which will accrue to exporters and to those making remittances thus providing a built in incentive to increase this flow.
7426,1992-93,The details of the new exchange system are being notified by the Reserve Bank of India.
7427,1992-93,The changes in trade policy are being notified separately by the Commerce Ministry.
7428,1992-93,One of the reasons why foreign exchange is diverted to illegal channels is the illegal import of gold.
7429,1992-93,It is time we took a bold step to recognise the realities of the situation and legalise the import of gold.
7430,1992-93,Government proposes to allow returning Indians and NRIs to import 5kg of gold per passenger with a modest import duty provided the gold as well as the import duty is financed from foreign exchange earned abroad.
7431,1992-93,"Many Honourable Members of this House have suggested that the Government should introduce a Gold Bond, which would help to mobilise the idle gold resources of ordinary citizens to supplement official reserves."
7432,1992-93,"I had indicated in Parliament that this should be considered only when the balance of payments situation improves, and adequate confidence has been built in the capacity of the Government to manage the economy."
7433,1992-93,This has now been achieved.
7434,1992-93,"Our reserves are large and do not need supplementing, but I see no reason why patriotic citizens should be denied the opportunity to contribute their mite to the development of India’s economy."
7435,1992-93,I propose to introduce a scheme under which citizens can obtain a Gold Bond in return for gold.
7436,1992-93,"The bond would be for a period of five to seven years and would be liquidated by return of gold, or equivalent value, at the option of the holder."
7437,1992-93,"It would enjoy a small interest, which will not attract incometax."
7438,1992-93,The bonds will also be free of wealth tax and gift tax.
7439,1992-93,"As an added incentive, holders of such bonds will not be asked any questions about the source of the gold holding."
7440,1992-93,The Reserve Bank of India is preparing a detailed proposal along these lines.
7441,1992-93,"One of the initiatives of the new Industrial Policy is a new approach towards foreign investment, which can play a vital role in upgrading our technology levels, integrating our industry into the global economy, and bringing in nondebt resources."
7442,1992-93,The Government proposes to actively encourage foreign investment in critical infrastructure sectors where capacities are inadequate and needs for investment are large.
7443,1992-93,"A policy to encourage private investment, including foreign investment, in the Power sector has already been announced."
7444,1992-93,"Another area which is critical for our future development, and for management of the balance of payments, is the hydrocarbon sector."
7445,1992-93,"Government has already announced that joint ventures will be permitted in both exploration and development, including development of existing fields."
7446,1992-93,"The Government will welcome proposals for private investment, including foreign investment, in production, refining and marketing of oil and gas, with a view to maximising the growth potential of this crucial area."
7447,1992-93,Concern is sometimes expressed that the policy of welcoming foreign investment will hurt Indian industry and may jeopardise our sovereignty.
7448,1992-93,"We must not remain permanent captives of a fear of the East 6 India Company, as if nothing has changed in the past 300 years!"
7449,1992-93,India as a nation is capable of dealing with foreign investors on its own terms.
7450,1992-93,"Indian industry has also come of age, and is now ready to enter a phase where it can both compete with foreign investment, and also cooperate with it."
7451,1992-93,This is the trend all over the world and we cannot afford to be left out.
7452,1992-93,The House can rest assured that we have enough policy instruments at our disposal to ensure that enterprises with foreign equity function in accordance with our national priorities.
7453,1992-93,"The new approach to industrial policy calls for a review of regulations such as the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, which introduced a great deal of detailed administrative control over companies where the foreign equity exceeded 40% and also on nonresident Indians."
7454,1992-93,The Reserve Bank of India has recently liberalised the procedure by granting general exemption from several of these controls applicable to Indian companies with foreign equity and to nonresident Indians returning to India.
7455,1992-93,There are other restrictions which prevent Indian companies and Indian residents from entering into various types of commercial relations with companies abroad without prior approval.
7456,1992-93,"These provisions are out of line with the needs of today’s economy, where Indian businesses will have to deal extensively with their counterparts abroad, requiring expeditious decision making."
7457,1992-93,The Government proposes to introduce comprehensive amendments to the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to bring it in line with the requirements of the new policy.
7458,1992-93,In my Budget speech last year I had referred to the importance of financial sector reform and had announced the establishment of a Committee on the Financial System.
7459,1992-93,The Narasimham Committee has submitted its report which has been tabled in Parliament.
7460,1992-93,"While commending the progress made by the banking system in several directions, the Committee has drawn attention to serious problems posed by the deterioration in the financial health of the system because of low profitability, poor portfolio quality and inadequate provisioning for bad debts."
7461,1992-93,"The Committee has made comprehensive recommendations for reform covering all aspects of banking, including the introduction of better capital adequacy norms, better provisioning for bad debts, rationalisation of the provisions for directed lending and the associated interest rate structure."
7462,1992-93,The thrust of the Committee’s recommendations is to move to a more efficient and competitive banking system including a larger role for the private sector.
7463,1992-93,Many of the recommendations can be implemented very quickly.
7464,1992-93,The Government proposes to implement the recommendations of the Committee in a phased manner.
7465,1992-93,"As a first step in implementing the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee, the Government has decided to begin a phased reduction in the Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR which at present locks up large quantities of bank funds in relatively low yielding Government securities."
7466,1992-93,"Accordingly, the SLR on incremental domestic liabilities of the commercial banks is being reduced from 38.5% to 30% with effect from 199293."
7467,1992-93,"This reduction is in line with the proposed reduction in the fiscal deficit, which will reduce the Central Government’s need to borrow from commercial banks."
7468,1992-93,It will release funds for banks to expand credit to agriculture and industry.
7469,1992-93,The market borrowing of the States will not be affected.
7470,1992-93,Steps are also being taken to develop an active market for Government securities which will make Government less dependent on statutory borrowing from the banks in future.
7471,1992-93,"In view of the decline that has already taken place in the rate of inflation, 7 it is possible to provide some relief in the interest rates charged by the Banks on commercial advances."
7472,1992-93,Honourable Members will be pleased to know that the Reserve Bank of India is separately notifying a reduction in the floor level of interest rates on commercial advances by one percentage point.
7473,1992-93,"Financial sector reform also includes reform of the capital markets, which will increasingly play a vital role in mobilising and allocating resources from the public."
7474,1992-93,Several initiatives announced in my Budget speech last year have since been implemented.
7475,1992-93,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI, has now been established on a statutory basis."
7476,1992-93,"As we gain experience, additional powers will be given to SEBI to strengthen its capability."
7477,1992-93,The Government has also issued guidelines which will govern the operation of new private sector mutual funds.
7478,1992-93,Government has also decided to give permission to companies with a good track record to issue convertible debentures or equity to investors abroad and to extend to these issues the same tax benefits as are available for Offshore Mutual Funds.
7479,1992-93,This will enable domestic companies to tap the large pool of equity funds available in world capital markets.
7480,1992-93,"We will also consider ways of allowing reputable foreign investors, such as pension funds, to invest in our capital markets, with suitable mechanisms to ensure that this does not threaten loss of management control."
7481,1992-93,"The role of the Controller of Capital Issues in the Finance Ministry needs to be reviewed, especially in the context of the emerging industrial and financial scenario."
7482,1992-93,"The practice of Government control over capital issues, as well as over pricing of issues, has lost its relevance in the changed circumstances of today."
7483,1992-93,It is therefore proposed to do away with Government control over capital issues including premium fixation.
7484,1992-93,Companies will be allowed to approach the market directly provided the issues are in conformity with published guidelines relating to disclosure and other matters related to investor protection.
7485,1992-93,Government proposes to bring necessary legislation to implement this decision.
7486,1992-93,In presenting the Budget for 199192 I had announced the Government’s intention to establish a National Renewal Fund with the objective of ensuring that the cost of technological change and modernisation does not fall too heavily on the workers.
7487,1992-93,This Fund was intended to provide a social safety net which would protect the workers from the adverse consequences of technological transformation.
7488,1992-93,The Government has now established the Fund.
7489,1992-93,"The Fund will provide assistance to cover the cost of retraining and redeployment of labour arising as a result of modernisation and restructuring, and also provide compensation to labour affected by restructuring of an industrial unit."
7490,1992-93,Government also proposes to approach multilateral financial institutions to meet part of the requirement for the National Renewal Fund.
7491,1992-93,It is estimated that about Rs 1000 crores would be available from the International Development Association to be used for social safety net schemes under the Fund including special schemes for unorganised sector workers.
7492,1992-93,In this context we would work out a scheme to upgrade the technology of handicrafts which employ a very large number of people in the decentralised sector.
7493,1992-93,Honourable Members may rest assured that the Government is firmly resolved to protect the interests of labour while dealing with the problems of industrial sickness and structural reforms.
7494,1992-93,Agriculture is the foundation of our national prosperity and no strategy of economic development can succeed in our country if it does not ensure rapid growth of production and employment in agriculture.
7495,1992-93,Nor can we hope to provide 8 sufficient jobs for our growing rural labour force unless we can transform the economy of our rural areas.
7496,1992-93,"This calls for a multipronged strategy involving effective implementation of land reforms, large investments in irrigation and drainage, improvement in water management systems, control of land degradation, strengthening of the credit system and improvements in agricultural extension and research."
7497,1992-93,"Much of this effort has to be made by the State Governments since Agriculture is a State subject, and it is our hope that State Governments will give these issues the highest priority."
7498,1992-93,"The Centre on its part is firmly committed to continued funding and revamping of the various poverty alleviation schemes, which are a major element in our development strategy."
7499,1992-93,Special attention needs to be paid to supporting innovative ideas for generating income and employment in rural areas through support to various types of agribusiness.
7500,1992-93,"As an experimental measure, Government proposes to set up a Small Farmers’ AgriBusiness Consortium as an autonomous corporate entity funded by the Reserve Bank of India, NABARD and IDBI."
7501,1992-93,"The Consortium will include representation from various Development Boards dealing with individual crops and Public Sector Corporations dealing with agriculture and agroindustries, private sector companies, banks, scientific organisations and farmers’ associations."
7502,1992-93,"The Consortium will function on the principles of economic efficiency, environmental soundness and social equity and will organise 12 major projects in 199293 in different parts of the country, based on a mix of enterprises with active participation by State Governments and farm families."
7503,1992-93,The programme will be expanded as we gain experience.
7504,1992-93,"We must begin a new chapter in our agricultural history where farm enterprises yield not only more food, but more productive jobs and higher income in rural areas."
7505,1992-93,I now turn to the Revised Estimates for 199192.
7506,1992-93,Our major macro economic objective in 199192 was to reduce the fiscal deficit in order to restore macroeconomic balance in the economy.
7507,1992-93,I am happy to inform the House that we have succeeded in this objective.
7508,1992-93,"The Budget Estimates for 199192 provided for a total expenditure of Rs 113,422 crores."
7509,1992-93,"Unlike in the past, when Revised Estimates of expenditure showed substantial increases over Budget Estimates, this year they are marginally lower by Rs 320 crores."
7510,1992-93,"On the revenue side there has been a large shortfall of Rs  3760 crores in customs revenue owing to the severe import compression during most of the year, but this has been partially offset by higher realisation from excise duties and income tax so that the shortfall in gross tax revenues is Rs 1869 crores."
7511,1992-93,"The, nontax revenues and capital receipts are also significantly higher."
7512,1992-93,"As a result total receipts are estimated at Rs 106,070 crores which is higher than the Budget Estimates of Rs 105,703 crores."
7513,1992-93,"The Budget deficit in the Revised Estimates for 199192 is Rs 7032 crores which is lower than the Budget Estimate of Rs 7719 crores, and much lower than in 199091, when the budget deficit reached Rs 11,347 crores."
7514,1992-93,"The fiscal deficit, which takes into account all borrowing, is Rs 37,792 crores in the Revised Estimates."
7515,1992-93,"This is almost identical to the figure of Rs 37,727 crores in the Budget Estimates, and is much lower than Rs  44,650 crores in 199091."
7516,1992-93,"With this, we have successfully reduced fiscal deficit from about 8.4% of GDP in 19909 to around 6.5% in 199192."
7517,1992-93,The reduction in the deficit was made possible by enforcement of strict discipline on the expenditure side.
7518,1992-93,Certain additional expenditure provisions became necessary after the Budget was presented.
7519,1992-93,"The most notable of these was the additional requirement for fertiliser subsidy, consequent on the decision to restrict the price increase from 40% proposed initially to only 30%, and also the fact that the rupee cost of imported fertilisers was higher than assumed in the Budget Estimates."
7520,1992-93,"As a result, the provision for fertiliser subsidy has been increased from Rs 4000 crores in the Budget Estimates to Rs 4800 crores in the Revised Estimates."
7521,1992-93,Even this amount does not fully cover the subsidy claims for 199192 and some amount will spill over into the next year as is normal commercial practice.
7522,1992-93,A separate provision of Rs 405 crores has been included in the Revised Estimates for the scheme for supplying fertilisers to small farmers at the prerevised prices.
7523,1992-93,I have also had to increase the Budget provision for food subsidy by Rs 250 crores on account of the delay in increasing issue prices.
7524,1992-93,An extra amount of Rs 550 crores has also been provided for the export subsidy.
7525,1992-93,"This subsidy was abolished on 3rd July 1991, but the claims in the pipeline appear to be much more than was originally anticipated."
7526,1992-93,These demands for additional expenditure have however been offset by savings located within the sanctioned Budgets of various Ministries.
7527,1992-93,The difficult resource position in 199192 had its impact on Plan expenditure.
7528,1992-93,Overall resource constraints forced the Government to restrict Budget support for the Central Plan and the Revised Estimates for this item are 7% less than Budget Estimates.
7529,1992-93,"Despite the marginal reduction, efforts were made to ensure that projects of high priority are not affected, and the reduction has been achieved mainly by regulating the release of funds to match the actual progress of schemes on the ground."
7530,1992-93,"However, Central Assistance for State and UT Plans was stepped up by Rs  651 crores, mainly on account of larger rupee requirements of externally aided projects."
7531,1992-93,"The House will be happy to note that even though the Central Government’s own expenditure in the Revised Estimates is below the Budget Estimates, the total transfer to the States by way of share of taxes, and Central Plan assistance is higher than the Budget Estimates by Rs  1683 crores."
7532,1992-93,This more than offsets the shortfall in small savings loans of Rs 1365 crores.
7533,1992-93,We have not allowed our fiscal difficulties to come in the way of meeting our obligations to the States in any way.
7534,1992-93,I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 199293.
7535,1992-93,The Eighth Five Year Plan commences from 1st April 1992 and aims at the objective of achieving near full employment in a period of ten years.
7536,1992-93,"The investment requirements of every sector are large, and it is important that Plan allocations should enable implementing agencies to make a good start, especially in the infrastructure sectors."
7537,1992-93,"However we have had to work within the limits imposed by the continuing need to restore macroeconomic balance, which is essential if we are to contain inflation and manage the balance of payments."
7538,1992-93,This calls for a further reduction in the fiscal deficit in 199293.
7539,1992-93,"Larger Plan expenditure can be accommodated within a smaller fiscal deficit if, apart from increasing tax and non tax revenues, Government’s nonPlan expenditure can be contained."
7540,1992-93,I must admit that this has been a daunting task.
7541,1992-93,"Interest charges are the largest single item of nonPlan expenditure and account for Rs  32,000 crores in the Budget Estimates for 199293."
7542,1992-93,"This represents 10 an increase of Rs  4750 crores over the Revised Estimates for 199192, which is larger than the increase in total nonPlan expenditure of Rs  4405 crores."
7543,1992-93,This means that in 199293 all other items of nonPlan expenditure taken together are actually lower than in the current year.
7544,1992-93,"Honourable Members will appreciate that interest charges are a committed expenditure, reflecting the cumulative effect of past deficits."
7545,1992-93,"This item can be controlled only by reducing the reliance on borrowed funds, and I intend to do this by reducing the fiscal deficit for 199293."
7546,1992-93,"However, the benefit of this action will be felt only by Finance Ministers presenting the Budget in future."
7547,1992-93,I venture to think that my successors as Finance Minister will be able to sleep far more peacefully than has been my lot thus far.
7548,1992-93,"For the Defence Services I am providing Rs  17,500 crores, an increase of 7% over the provision of Rs  16,350 crores in the current year."
7549,1992-93,"Combined with some economies and tight expenditure control, I am confident that this allocation will enable our armed forces to fulfil their responsibilities in ensuring the security and defence of the nation."
7550,1992-93,"In the election Manifesto of our Party, we had committed ourselves to find an innovative solution to the long standing demand of Defence pensioners for ‘One Rank One Pension’."
7551,1992-93,"An Empowered Committee, under the chairmanship of Raksha Mantri and comprising exservicemen and Members of Parliament representing the major political parties has looked into the issue and its recommendations have been accepted by the Government."
7552,1992-93,"Accordingly, Government has sanctioned ad hoc increase in the pension rates applicable to Defence personnel."
7553,1992-93,"This decision effective from 1.1.92 will benefit over six lakh Armed Forces pensioners of all ranks, of whom over two lakhs are Jawans, some of whom retired after 1.1.86."
7554,1992-93,Government has also ordered grant of exgratia Family Pension to the families of deceased Reservists not in receipt of Family Pension.
7555,1992-93,These benefits will entail an expenditure of over Rs  120 crores per annum at current rates of dearness relief.
7556,1992-93,Subsidies are another important component in nonPlan expenditure.
7557,1992-93,"Last year, Food, Fertiliser and Export subsidies were the three major subsidies and their rapid growth has been one of the main factors behind the unchecked growth of nonPlan expenditure."
7558,1992-93,We made an important change this year by abolishing export subsidies.
7559,1992-93,"However, some subsidy payments still remain in the pipeline, and I am providing Rs  480 crores on this account."
7560,1992-93,Food subsidy is a part of our system of food security for the poorer and weaker sections of our population and is a basic element in our social policy.
7561,1992-93,I am providing an allocation of Rs  2500 crores on this account which should be sufficient for the normal requirements of the system.
7562,1992-93,The revamped Public Distribution System being implemented in 1700 backward blocks will require an additional allocation of Rs  250 crores on account of the additional subsidy and also the cost of constructing a large number of godowns with a capacity of 3 lakh tonnes.
7563,1992-93,The allocation for these items will be augmented in the course of the year to meet the requirements fully.
7564,1992-93,This brings me to fertiliser subsidy which has grown into the largest single subsidy in our system.
7565,1992-93,"There is no doubt that fertiliser is an essential ingredient for agricultural production, and agricultural development is vital not only for economic growth in general, but also to ensure rising levels of income and employment in rural areas."
7566,1992-93,"In 198081, the fertiliser subsidy was 12% of the total allocation in the Central and State Plans taken together for Agriculture, Rural 11 Development, Special Area Programmes and Irrigation and Flood Control."
7567,1992-93,It increased to 33% in 199192.
7568,1992-93,A Parliamentary Committee is currently looking into the whole issue of fertiliser pricing and subsidy including alternatives for restructuring the subsidy.
7569,1992-93,"I propose to wait for the report of this Committee and take a view, on this matter later in the year."
7570,1992-93,"Taking all factors into account, I am making a provision of Rs  5000 crores for fertiliser subsidy in 199293."
7571,1992-93,Other items of nonPlan expenditure have been tightly constrained in the allocations provided to keep the fiscal deficit within manageable levels.
7572,1992-93,I have requested my colleagues in all Ministries to review the expenditure control system in their Ministries to ensure that every possible step is taken to enforce economy so that the provisions being made in the Budget Estimates are not exceeded.
7573,1992-93,"As in the last two years, in the Budget Estimates for 199293 also no separate provision is being made for the additional dearness allowance installments that may become payable in that year."
7574,1992-93,All Ministries will be expected to absorb the additional expenditure on this account within the approved Budget provisions.
7575,1992-93,"With these provisions, the total allocation for nonPlan expenditure stands at Rs 84,475 crores, higher by Rs  4,405 crores compared to the Revised Estimates for 199192."
7576,1992-93,"But then, as I mentioned earlier, the increase in interest expenditure alone is Rs 4,750 crores."
7577,1992-93,Honourable Members would appreciate that the large requirements for interest and subsidies make it difficult to reduce nonPlan expenditure further and this limits the extent to which the budget can support Plan expenditure.
7578,1992-93,"Nevertheless, I have tried to provide adequately for all the critical areas of Plan expenditure."
7579,1992-93,"Central assistance for the Plans of States and Union Territories is being stepped up from Rs  14,710 crores in Budget Estimates 199192 to Rs  16,111 crores in 199293."
7580,1992-93,"This increase of Rs  1401 crores, coupled with an increase of Rs  2237 crores in the share of taxes, even at the existing levels of taxation, should enable the States to substantially increase the allocations for the various Plan programmes."
7581,1992-93,"The total Central Sector Plan outlay for 199293 has been fixed at Rs 48,407 crores."
7582,1992-93,"This is based on budgetary support for the Plan of Rs  18,501 crores, and a contribution of Rs  29,906 crores from internal and extrabudgetary resources of the various undertakings/enterprises."
7583,1992-93,The internal and extrabudgetary resources show a sharp increase of 25% over the current year’s level and this is critical to achieve the substantial increase in the Plan outlays of the various infrastructure sectors.
7584,1992-93,Thus the outlay for the Railways stands increased from Rs  5325 crores in the current year’s
7585,1992-93,Budget Estimates to Rs  5700 crores in the next year’s Plan;
7586,1992-93,Shipping from Rs  617 crores to Rs  1222 crores; Civil Aviation from Rs  433 crores to Rs  1036 crores; Telecommunications from Rs  3203 crores to Rs  4500 crores and Fertiliser industry from Rs  411 crores to Rs  1234 crores.
7587,1992-93,"The outlay for Power has been fixed at Rs 6411 crores, and for Petroleum at Rs  6054 crores."
7588,1992-93,"The allocation for Rural Development Programmes in the Budget is Rs 2610 crores, which is somewhat lower than the Budget Estimates of 199192 though it is higher than the Revised Estimates."
7589,1992-93,This however presents only part of the total effort we are making in support of the weaker sections in our rural areas.
7590,1992-93,"The Government is deeply conscious of its special responsibility to protect the poorer sections of our society, especially in rural areas from the burdens that would otherwise be forced upon them as the economy goes through the process of macro 12 economic stabilisation and economic restructuring."
7591,1992-93,"It is therefore proposed to earmark an additional allocation of Rs  500 crores from the corpus of the National Renewal Fund for employment generation schemes to supplement the normal employment generation through the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana, particularly in those areas where the pressure for such employment is seen to be more than in earlier years."
7592,1992-93,"The additional allocation of foodgrains, through the Public Distribution System in the 1700 most backward blocks at a subsidised rate is another important step for protecting these vulnerable sections of society from the pressure on prices."
7593,1992-93,"Taking the proposed additional allocations on these accounts together with the Plan provision in the Budget, the total allocation to rural development would show a substantial increase over the current year."
7594,1992-93,The Plan outlay for the Family Welfare programme has been stepped up from Rs  749 crores in the current year to Rs  1000 crores next year reflecting the Government’s firm commitment to tackle the population problem.
7595,1992-93,The outlay for the programmes of the Ministry of Welfare has also been increased from Rs  479 crores to Rs  530 crores reflecting fully Government’s commitment to protection of the weaker sections of society.
7596,1992-93,"Despite severe resource constraints, most of the other sectors which are largely dependent on budgetary support for their Plan outlays have been provided at least the same order of budget support as in the current year."
7597,1992-93,I would have liked to provide more but we also have to live within the constraint of available resources.
7598,1992-93,I would particularly like to point out that we must give up the practice of judging the quality of our Plan effort by the increase in the outlays provided for in the Budget.
7599,1992-93,Our resources are scarce and there is a vast unexploited potential for improving the productivity of available resource use.
7600,1992-93,There has to be much tighter scrutiny of various claims on resources and much greater emphasis on how to get more out of available resources.
7601,1992-93,We cannot simply spend our way into prosperity.
7602,1992-93,"Gross tax receipts at existing rates of taxation are estimated next year at Rs 75,541 crores compared to Rs  67,300 crores in the current year’s Revised Estimates."
7603,1992-93,"The States’ share of taxes is placed at Rs  18,492 crores showing an increase of Rs 1293 crores over the current year’s Revised Estimates."
7604,1992-93,Nontax revenues next year show an increase of Rs  2689 crores over the current year’s Revised Estimates.
7605,1992-93,This includes Rs  416 crores of deferred dividends from the Railways.
7606,1992-93,Next year’s estimates assume an increase of Rs  423 crores from dividends and profits of public sector enterprises.
7607,1992-93,"Unlike in the past, it is proposed to ensure that these enterprises transfer as dividend or surplus profits, a reasonable part of their post tax profits instead of determining the dividend payable merely on the basis of capital investment."
7608,1992-93,The Reserve Bank of India will also be transferring a larger share of its profits.
7609,1992-93,"Under Capital Receipts, I have taken credit for market borrowing of Rs  5000 crores."
7610,1992-93,This is significantly lower than the amount of Rs  7500 crores in the Budget Estimates for the current year and reflects our objective of reducing the fiscal deficit and consequently the recourse to borrowed funds.
7611,1992-93,"External assistance including grants, but net of repayments, is estimated at Rs  5374 crores."
7612,1992-93,The disinvestment in public sector equity undertaken in the current year has been successfully completed.
7613,1992-93,There is scope for continuing this process in 199293 with a view to raising noninflationary resources for development.
7614,1992-93,I am 13 accordingly taking credit for a receipt of Rs  2500 crores from further disinvestment of equity holding in public sector enterprises.
7615,1992-93,"In addition to this amount, Government will consider a further sale of equity of Rs  1000 crores to provide resources to the National Renewal Fund in 199293, which can be used for various schemes of assistance to workers in the unorganised sector, including women workers, who may be adversely affected by the process of economic restructuring."
7616,1992-93,These resources will also be used to fund the special employment creating schemes in backward areas which I have mentioned earlier.
7617,1992-93,"Thus, at existing rates of taxation, total receipts are placed at Rs  114, 215 crores and total expenditure at Rs  119,087 crores."
7618,1992-93,This leaves a gap of Rs  4872 crores.
7619,1992-93,"While presenting the budget last year, I drew attention to the need for a comprehensive reform of both the direct and indirect tax system and had explained that lack of time had made it difficult to do as much as I would have liked in this regard."
7620,1992-93,"Subsequently, the Government set up a Tax Reforms Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. Raja J. Chelliah."
7621,1992-93,The Committee has since submitted its Interim Report.
7622,1992-93,The Report distills the wisdom of some of our most distinguished experts on the complex subject of reform of both direct and indirect taxes and I have drawn heavily upon it in framing my Budget proposals.
7623,1992-93,The summary of recommendations contained in the Report is separately being placed in Parliament to enable fuller appreciation of the analysis of the Committee and the rationale for its recommendations.
7624,1992-93,"There is a consensus among fiscal experts, based on experience gained all over the world, that a moderately progressive tax structure combined with strong enforcement is the best way of encouraging honesty and voluntary tax compliance."
7625,1992-93,"The Chelliah Committee has endorsed this view and has recommended that our direct tax system would be more effective if the income tax regime had lower rates of taxation, with a narrower spread between the entry rate and the maximum marginal rate, and a minimum of tax incentives."
7626,1992-93,I agree with this assessment and I propose to restructure the personal income tax in the following manner.
7627,1992-93,"I propose to enhance the exemption limit for income tax levy from Rs 22,000 at present to Rs 28,000."
7628,1992-93,"This will provide substantial relief to the taxpayers in the lower income group and I am sure it will be welcomed by the Honourable Members, many of whom had urged such an adjustment even last year."
7629,1992-93,I hope this will convince them that I am an attentive and sensitive listener to what goes on in this august House.
7630,1992-93,"I further propose that there will only be three tax rate slabs, with the entry rate of 20 per cent."
7631,1992-93,A corresponding revision is also being made in the case of specified Hindu undivided families.
7632,1992-93,"Because of the severe resource constraints, I am compelled to retain the surcharge at 12 per cent."
7633,1992-93,"With the reduction in tax rates, a number of tax exemptions, which conferred large benefits on higher income tax payers are no longer justified."
7634,1992-93,"I, therefore, propose to abolish the deductions under sections 80L, 80CCA and 80CCB 14 of the Incometax Act."
7635,1992-93,The computation of income from house property is also being rationalised in respect of certain deductions presently being allowed.
7636,1992-93,"The provision under section 88, which provides for tax rebate in respect of specified savings such as Life Insurance, Provident funds etc. will however continue, as these are normally availed of by fixed salary earners."
7637,1992-93,"In fact, I propose to widen its scope by including within its purview contributions to Pension Funds set up by the National Housing Bank and by Mutual Funds."
7638,1992-93,"I am also providing that those who wish to continue contributing to the savings schemes which until now qualified for deduction under section 80CCA and 80CCB, can get tax rebate under Section 88 of the Incometax Act."
7639,1992-93,"It is said that the child is the father of man, but some of our taxpayers have converted children into tax shelters for their fathers."
7640,1992-93,"The tax law provides for clubbing of income from gifts given by parents but this does not apply to other income, including income from other gifted assets, and the practice of cross gifting is widely used to evade clubbing."
7641,1992-93,"The Chelliah Committee has recommended that in order to plug this loophole, which accounts for a substantial leakage of revenue, the income of a minor child should be clubbed with that of the parent."
7642,1992-93,There is merit in this suggestion and I propose to accept it.
7643,1992-93,"Recognising however the existence of a number of child prodigies, especially child artistes in our country, I propose to exclude their professional income, as also any wage income of minors, from the purview of such clubbing."
7644,1992-93,The practice of clubbing the income of minor children with that of the parent for tax purposes is in vogue in a number of countries.
7645,1992-93,The revenue loss on account of the restructuring of incometax rates as traditionally estimated will be Rs 1500 crores.
7646,1992-93,"However, this will be offset by the proposed abridgement in the concessions and tax exemptions and the change in the tax treatment of minor’s income."
7647,1992-93,"If, as I expect, lower tax rates will lead to better tax compliance, there will be a net revenue gain even though it is not possible to quantify it."
7648,1992-93,"If taxpayers cooperate with me and revenue earnings go up significantly, I propose to reward the taxpayers with a further cut in income tax rates."
7649,1992-93,The ball is now in their court.
7650,1992-93,"In a country with a population of over 800 million, hardly 7 million persons pay income and corporate tax."
7651,1992-93,It is therefore necessary to attract new taxpayers into the tax net.
7652,1992-93,"With this end in view, I propose to introduce a presumptive tax system in respect of shop keepers and other retail traders with an annual turnover below Rs  5 lakhs."
7653,1992-93,"In order to enable them to avoid the difficulty of maintaining detailed account books, filing a complicated tax return and going through the normal assessment procedure, a simplified scheme has been worked out under which the taxpayer will give only brief particulars of his turnover and pay just Rs 1400 as tax for that year."
7654,1992-93,This should enable potential taxpayers in this category to overcome their psychological hesitation of getting into the tax system.
7655,1992-93,The scheme is being introduced on a purely optional basis and is intended only for those who may have taxable income and wish to avail of this simplified procedure.
7656,1992-93,"With the increase in the exemption limit to Rs 28,000, those with a turnover of less than Rs  2.5 lakhs to Rs 3 lakhs may well find that they do not have to pay this presumptive tax."
7657,1992-93,The present tax treatment of long term capital gains has been criticised on the ground that the deduction allowed in computing taxable gain is not related to the period of time for which the asset has been held.
7658,1992-93,It does not take into 15 account the inflation that may have occurred over time.
7659,1992-93,The Chelliah Committee has suggested a system of indexation to take care of the problem and I propose to accept its recommendation.
7660,1992-93,Taxable capital gains will be computed by allowing the cost of the asset to be adjusted for general inflation before deducting from the sale proceeds.
7661,1992-93,The adjustment factor for each year will be notified by the Central Government.
7662,1992-93,The long term capital gains thus computed will be taxed at 20 per cent.
7663,1992-93,"The new system will favour those whose capital gains accrue over a longer period, while those making capital gains over a shorter period will pay a higher tax."
7664,1992-93,This is as it should be.
7665,1992-93,"The cut off date for valuation is also being shifted from 1st April, 1974 to 1st April, 1981."
7666,1992-93,"With these changes, I propose to withdraw the standard deduction in computing taxable capital gains and also the exemptions under section 54E for capital gains invested in specified assets and section 53 in respect of capital gains arising from sale of residential house."
7667,1992-93,"I therefore propose to increase the deduction available to such persons from Rs 6,000 at present to Rs 12,000 per year."
7668,1992-93,"Further, the scope of this tax concession is being made available to all taxpayers irrespective of their income."
7669,1992-93,"I, therefore, propose to increase the standard deduction from Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 in the case of working women having total income upto seventy five thousand rupees."
7670,1992-93,I hope this will convince Honourable lady members of this House about my commitment to the cause of social and economic uplift of Indian women.
7671,1992-93,The only quid pro quo I expect from them is to defend the budget regardless of their party affiliations.
7672,1992-93,"Having regard to the human dimensions of the tragedy, I propose to exempt, in all cases, the compensation received by such recipients from income tax liability."
7673,1992-93,I propose to substantially liberalise the provisions relating to hospitalisation and medical 16 insurance.
7674,1992-93,Tax benefits to salaried persons will no longer be limited to treatment in a few government recognised hospitals only.
7675,1992-93,"Similarly, for selfemployed persons, the deduction available for medical insurance is being enhanced from Rs  3,000 to Rs  6,000."
7676,1992-93,"I propose to extend the benefit of the exemption, subject to certain guidelines, to the employees in the private sector as well."
7677,1992-93,"There has been a long standing criticism that by subjecting the income of both partnership firms as well as the partners to taxation, we are engaging in double taxation."
7678,1992-93,The Chelliah Committee has also stressed that double taxation in this regard should be avoided.
7679,1992-93,"I agree that we should avoid double taxation and I propose, as a measure of relief, to treat the firm as a separate tax entity and do away with the taxation of the same income in the hands of partners."
7680,1992-93,I propose to allow deduction towards interest and salary payments made to partners from the income of the firm and then tax the balance income in the hands of the firm at a flat rate of 40 per cent..
7681,1992-93,The proportion of deduction allowed decreases with the income level of the firm and is so designed that the total tax incidence on small firms and professional firms will be reduced.
7682,1992-93,The partners will not be taxed on their share in the income of the firm though they will be liable to pay tax on salary and interest income.
7683,1992-93,"This method will result in enormous simplification from the point of view of taxpayers as well as tax administration as the proposed scheme will do away with complexities, associated with the procedure relating to registration of firms, rectification of partners’ assessments when firms’ assessments are revised, etc. 66."
7684,1992-93,"Last year, I introduced provisions relating to tax deduction at source in respect of interest on term deposits with banks and commission payments."
7685,1992-93,"There has, however, been considerable criticism from taxpayers about the implementation of these provisions."
7686,1992-93,I have also received representations from a number of Members of Parliament seeking withdrawal of these provisions.
7687,1992-93,The system of tax deduction at source is a useful tool and one of the well recognised methods of enforcing tax compliance in many countries.
7688,1992-93,"However, a harassed Finance Minister has to be sensitive to the opinions of Honourable members of Parliament even when they differ from his own convictions."
7689,1992-93,"Therefore, I propose to withdraw these two provisions."
7690,1992-93,"The Wealthtax Act, 1957 has far too many exemptions making its administration enormously complicated."
7691,1992-93,"The valuation of certain assets such as shares also presents problems, since very high market values reflecting speculative activity can lead to a heavy burden on shareholders who are long term investors."
7692,1992-93,There is also no distinction at present between productive and nonproductive assets.
7693,1992-93,"The Chelliah Committee has suggested that, in order to encourage the taxpayers to invest in productive assets such as shares, securities, bonds, bank deposits, etc. and also to promote investments through Mutual Funds, these financial assets should be exempted from wealth tax."
7694,1992-93,"Wealth tax should be levied on individuals, Hindu undivided families and all companies only in respect of non productive assets such as residential houses including farm houses and urban land, jewelry, bullion, motor cars, planes, boats and yachts which are not used for commercial purposes."
7695,1992-93,"The Committee has further suggested that such tax should be at the rate of one per cent., with a basic exemption of Rs 15 lakhs."
7696,1992-93,I propose to 17 accept this recommendation and I hope this change will encourage investments in productive assets and discourage investment in ostentatious nonproductive wealth.
7697,1992-93,Earlier in my speech I have referred to the importance which the Government attaches to the capital market and the special role of mutual funds including private sector mutual funds.
7698,1992-93,"In order to treat all mutual funds alike in tax matters, I propose to exempt from income tax mutual funds in both public sector and private sector recognised by the Securities and Exchange Board of India."
7699,1992-93,I had also referred to the scheme permitting Indian Companies to issue convertible bonds and equity to investors abroad.
7700,1992-93,"I propose to tax the income and capital gains from these issues at a concessional rate of 10 per cent., as is applicable to Offshore mutual funds."
7701,1992-93,It is hoped that these measures will give a new thrust to the capital market in the country.
7702,1992-93,"Last year, I had extended expenditure tax to cover airconditioned restaurants in order to mop up additional resources."
7703,1992-93,I have received several representations that this provision falls heavily on innumerable restaurants and small establishments which are patronised mainly by the middle class.
7704,1992-93,"It has been suggested that air conditioning in restaurants, unlike in homes, is no longer a luxury item of the rich."
7705,1992-93,The largest number of such complaints have come from Bombay.
7706,1992-93,"Having lived in Bombay for two and a half years, I have special regard for the citizens of this great city."
7707,1992-93,This has been reinforced by their voting behaviour in the recent elections to the Municipal Corporation.
7708,1992-93,"I, therefore, feel a special obligation to respond."
7709,1992-93,I propose to withdraw this levy as far as the restaurants are concerned.
7710,1992-93,"However, I have made certain changes in the scope of the Expendituretax Act relating to hotel receipts."
7711,1992-93,I propose to enhance the qualifying limit for liability relating to room charges of the hotel from the present Rs 400 per day to Rs 1200 per day.
7712,1992-93,"In view of the exchange rate adjustments undertaken recently, there is no longer any need for exempting expenditure made in foreign exchange from the tax."
7713,1992-93,"I am, accordingly, withdrawing this exemption."
7714,1992-93,"With a view to providing support to the cooperative sector, I propose to exempt all cooperative societies including urban cooperative societies engaged in the business of banking from the purview of Interesttax Act."
7715,1992-93,I recognise the need for a reform of the corporate tax system.
7716,1992-93,This is also an area where rates of taxation need to be lowered and I would like to give advance notice of my intention to begin lowering them as soon as possible.
7717,1992-93,"However, as the detailed recommendations of the Chelliah Committee on corporate taxation are yet to be received, I propose to defer major restructuring in this area until after I have received its recommendations."
7718,1992-93,"Accordingly, for the present there will be no change in the rate structure as well as the surcharge."
7719,1992-93,"In this budget, I propose to make just two changes."
7720,1992-93,"Ordinarily, depreciation and investment allowance carried forward from earlier years is set off against the current income."
7721,1992-93,"In line with the rationalisation of depreciation allowance brought about last year, I propose that in respect of assessment year 199293, the quantum of set off for carried forward depreciation and investment allowance in the case of companies, where such amount exceeds Rs 1,00,000, shall be limited to twothird of such amount and the remaining one 18 third will be allowed to be adjusted in the assessment year 199394."
7722,1992-93,"Further, having regard to the widespread criticism that the Incometax Act has artificial ceilings in regard to certain business expenses, I am liberalising some of the items on the basis of the recommendation of the Chelliah Committee."
7723,1992-93,"Having regard to the complexities in tax laws, I have been receiving representations that the Government should give Advance Rulings whenever a taxpayer has doubts about the tax liability in respect of intended transactions."
7724,1992-93,This practice obtains in a number of countries.
7725,1992-93,There are certain practical difficulties in implementing such a suggestion.
7726,1992-93,"However, in the interest of avoiding needless litigation and promoting better taxpayer relations, a scheme for giving Advance Rulings in respect of transactions involving nonresidents, is being worked out and will be put into operation soon."
7727,1992-93,The scope of this can be extended subsequently on the basis of experience gained.
7728,1992-93,The Government is also planning to set up the National Court of Direct Taxes in order to ensure that litigation in direct tax matters is settled expeditiously.
7729,1992-93,"Along with this, the Government would also like to bring forward, as soon as possible, a Bill on Direct Taxes Code, integrating therein all the three direct taxes so as to make the law easily understandable and tax administration simple."
7730,1992-93,I do not propose to take up the time of the House with other minor changes in the Direct Tax Laws.
7731,1992-93,My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to yield a net revenue gain of Rs  795 crores.
7732,1992-93,"Of this amount, Rs  435 crores will accrue to the States."
7733,1992-93,I now turn to the proposals relating to indirect taxes.
7734,1992-93,"A long standing complaint of our industry, and of experts in trade policy is that our customs tariff rates are too high and increasingly out of line with the trends in our competitor countries, all of whom have reduced tariffs to very moderate levels."
7735,1992-93,My colleague the Honourable Commerce Minister has repeatedly told me that we cannot expect to compete with these countries in world markets if we persist with high tariff rates which have the effect of creating a high cost industrial structure.
7736,1992-93,This is in line with the directions I had indicated in my budget speech last year.
7737,1992-93,"The Chelliah Committee, which was asked to look into all aspects of customs duties, has recommended reduction in the general level of tariffs, a reduction in the dispersion of the tariff rates and a rationalisation of the system with abolition of numerous enduse exemptions and concessions."
7738,1992-93,"The Committee has also rightly suggested that the process of reform should be gradual, so as to moderate the impact of the adjustment, both in terms of possible revenue loss and the pace at which domestic industry is exposed to competition."
7739,1992-93,I propose to act on these recommendations by making a substantial start in this budget on reforming the customs tariff structure.
7740,1992-93,Last year I had begun the process of reducing import duties by lowering the ad valorem rates of basic plus auxiliary duties of customs to a maximum of 150%.
7741,1992-93,I now propose to lower the peak tariff level further by reducing the basic plus auxiliary rates of import duties inclusive of specific duties to a maximum of 110% with the exception of passenger baggage and alcoholic beverages.
7742,1992-93,"The loss of revenue on account of this proposal as traditionally estimated is Rs  1700 crores, though I feel it could be much lower in practice."
7743,1992-93,My next proposal relates to the duty on capital goods.
7744,1992-93,"The general duty on capital goods, including project imports, is currently at 80% which is below the peak rate of 110%."
7745,1992-93,"However, there is a good case for giving priority to reducing the duty on capital goods because high duty on capital goods constitutes a permanent increase in the cost of production for the life of the unit."
7746,1992-93,"In order to encourage new investment in export oriented industries, we should move to a lower duty rate on capital goods at an accelerated rate."
7747,1992-93,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the duty rate on project imports and general machinery from 80% to 60%."
7748,1992-93,"In the case of capital goods including project imports for electronics industry, I propose to reduce the import duty from 60% to 50%."
7749,1992-93,"In relation to capital goods for projects of coal mining and crude petroleum refining, I propose a deeper reduction in the import duty prescribing a uniform rate of 30%."
7750,1992-93,"In the case of power projects, the present concessional duty rate of 30% or 40% is being rationalised to a uniform rate of 30%."
7751,1992-93,I also propose to reduce the import duty on other capital goods currently attracting duty above 80% by 10 percentage points.
7752,1992-93,The existing concession in the duty rates available to the components of specified machinery enabling those items to be imported at rates below the rate applicable to the machinery is proposed to be continued.
7753,1992-93,These changes will not adversely affect the competitive position of the Indian capital goods industry especially in view of the exchange rate adjustment effected last year.
7754,1992-93,These proposals involve a loss of revenue of about Rs 840 crores.
7755,1992-93,"In view of the reduction of tariff peaks, I have also taken the opportunity to remove some of the enduse notifications for concessional duty imports."
7756,1992-93,"In this process of rationalisation, some duties may go up marginally."
7757,1992-93,"However, in view of the overall reduction of duty rates, industry should be able to absorb such marginal increases."
7758,1992-93,In my last budget I had proposed certain rationalisation of the rates of auxiliary duty of customs.
7759,1992-93,I propose to further rationalise the auxiliary duty structure by reducing the number of duty slabs to four.
7760,1992-93,The loss of revenue on this account is estimated at Rs  125 crores.
7761,1992-93,Agriculture is the bedrock on which our economic development depends and the vital inputs for this sector have always been accorded a preferential tax treatment.
7762,1992-93,"In line with this principle, I propose to reduce the duty rate on 15 specified pesticides from 110% at present to 75%, by adding them to the list of pesticides eligible for this concession."
7763,1992-93,I also propose to reduce the import duty on two pesticide intermediates from the present level of 120% to 65%.
7764,1992-93,So also I propose to exempt three specified pesticide intermediates completely from excise duty.
7765,1992-93,These proposals involve a revenue loss of about Rs 8 crores.
7766,1992-93,Successful agricultural development calls for injection of new seeds which can increase productivity and imported seeds and planting material can help in this process.
7767,1992-93,"I, therefore, propose to fully exempt from import duty, oil seeds, seeds of vegetables, flowers and ornamental plants; tubers and bulbs of flowers; cuttings or saplings of flower plants; and seeds of fruitplants and pulses, for the purpose of sowing and planting."
7768,1992-93,"In order to ensure efficient transplanting of seedlings, I also propose to reduce the import duty on rice transplanters from 80% to 40%."
7769,1992-93,The petrochemical industry suffers from high duty rates on certain basic feed stocks which are the building blocks of the industry.
7770,1992-93,There is a case for duty reduction and rationalisation in this area.
7771,1992-93,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the import duty on propylene from 120% to 80%, on butadiene from 55% to 40% and on benzene from 40% to 25%."
7772,1992-93,I also propose a uniform import duty of 40% for ethyl 20 benzene and styrene which are essential inputs for the manufacture of polystyrene.
7773,1992-93,"Similarly, I propose to reduce import duty on certain specified feed stocks which find use in the manufacture of polyethylenes from 120% to 40%."
7774,1992-93,The loss of revenue on account of the proposals would be around Rs 26 crores.
7775,1992-93,"As a measure of relief to the asbestos cement industry which serves the housing, water supply and irrigation sectors, I propose to reduce the import duty on asbestos fibre from 90% to 70%."
7776,1992-93,The proposal involves a loss of revenue of Rs 18 crores.
7777,1992-93,Films in our country have become an important vehicle of national integration.
7778,1992-93,I have therefore to worry about the economic health of this important industry.
7779,1992-93,"In order to give relief to the film industry, which is facing increasing competition from cable TV and video, I propose to reduce the import duty on unexposed colour negatives of cinematograph film by 20 percentage points from the existing level."
7780,1992-93,The loss of revenue involved in the proposal is Rs 8 crores.
7781,1992-93,I propose to reduce the import duty on specified items of machinery required for the manufacture of fly ash and phosphogypsum bricks and building components.
7782,1992-93,Last year as a relief to the newspaper industry I had exempted standard newsprint fully from customs duty.
7783,1992-93,I feel my support base in the Press could do with some strengthening.
7784,1992-93,I now propose to fully exempt glazed newsprint which is presently attracting import duty of Rs 550 per metric ton from payment of duty.
7785,1992-93,The proposal involves a revenue loss of about Rs  3 crores.
7786,1992-93,I have already mentioned that import of gold by Indians including persons of Indian origin as part of their baggage will now be allowed.
7787,1992-93,"Every such passenger will be allowed to bring upto five kilograms of gold and the import duty on such gold will be Rs 450 per 10 grams, which works out to about 15% in ad valorem terms."
7788,1992-93,This duty will be payable in convertible foreign exchange.
7789,1992-93,"I am confident that this step will be welcomed by all, except those engaged in the hitherto profitable business of smuggling this metal into the country."
7790,1992-93,"The restructuring of customs duty being attempted in this Budget is the beginning of a process in which our customs duties are gradually reduced, over a three to four year period, to levels comparable with those in other developing countries."
7791,1992-93,I would like to reassure Honourable Members that they need have no fear that the process of reducing duties will lead to the deindustrialisation of India.
7792,1992-93,"On the contrary, the reduction is necessary to give the Indian industry an environment in which it can increase its competitiveness through absorption of technology and greater integration with the world economy."
7793,1992-93,This is essential if we are to achieve true self reliance.
7794,1992-93,We shall take effective promotional measures to build up the competitive strength of Indian industry.
7795,1992-93,"The proposed restructuring of customs duty, together with the other changes in customs duty results in a net loss of Rs  2023.35 crores."
7796,1992-93,"The loss is estimated in the conventional way and it is possible that it may be overestimated if we allow for a substantial improvement in the balance of payments, permitting a larger volume of imports and, therefore, a higher level of customs revenue."
7797,1992-93,"In the field of excise duties, I have been guided by the objectives of rationalising the excise duty structure, providing reliefs where necessary and, of course, raising additional resources to offset the revenue loss from restructuring of customs tariffs."
7798,1992-93,"While presenting the budget for 199192, I had referred to my intention to rationalise and simplify the procedures, rules and regulations pertaining to indirect taxes so that the delays in the system are eliminated and the interface between the tax collector and the tax payer is reduced to the minimum."
7799,1992-93,"I propose to make an advance in this direction by abolishing licensing controls on production and manufacture under the Central Excises and Salt Act, 1944."
7800,1992-93,The assessees would simply be required to register themselves with the central excise authorities.
7801,1992-93,At present assessees are required to get their central excise licences renewed every five years.
7802,1992-93,Registration will be valid as long as the assessee continues the manufacturing activity.
7803,1992-93,I am proposing suitable amendments in the law to this end.
7804,1992-93,"Honourable Members would be aware that a Settlement Commission was established in 1976 under the Incometax Act, 1961."
7805,1992-93,"I propose to set up a Settlement Commission, on similar lines, for dealing with customs and central excise disputes between the Department and the assessee."
7806,1992-93,I trust this will help in speedy settlement of tax disputes.
7807,1992-93,Honourable Members may also recall that a law was enacted in 1986 for the establishment of an appellate tribunal for the adjudication of disputes relating to the determination of the rates of duties of customs and central excise and to the valuation in pursuance of Article 323B of the Constitution.
7808,1992-93,"Due to unavoidable reasons, the tribunal could not be established."
7809,1992-93,"I propose to introduce legislation to suitably amend the Customs and Central Excise Revenues Appellate Tribunal Act, 1986 and set up the tribunal."
7810,1992-93,"The housing sector is important, both socially and for employment generation and as such deserves special treatment."
7811,1992-93,"I propose to fully exempt from excise duty bricks and tiles having a minimum content of 25% of red mud, which is a waste product of aluminium industry."
7812,1992-93,I also propose to fully exempt light weight concrete building blocks from excise duty.
7813,1992-93,Further I propose to reduce the excise duty on prefabricated buildings from 15% to 5%.
7814,1992-93,"I also propose to fully exempt doors and windows made of plastic, iron and steel which incidentally would conserve our dwindling forest cover."
7815,1992-93,"Further, I propose to exempt completely panel doors which are currently attracting 30% excise duty."
7816,1992-93,The proposals involve a revenue loss of about Rs  4 crores.
7817,1992-93,The glass container industry has been going through a lean period.
7818,1992-93,I propose to reduce excise duty on glass containers from 40% to 30%.
7819,1992-93,"The excise duty on glass containers manufactured by semiautomatic process and mouth blown process will also be reduced from the existing levels of 30% and 15% to 20% and 10%, respectively."
7820,1992-93,The proposals involve a revenue loss of Rs  30 crores.
7821,1992-93,At present there is a wide dispersion of duty rates among various sectors of the textile industry.
7822,1992-93,My primary aim is to simplify and rationalise the tariff structure and to reduce the duty differential between the various textile fibres and yarns.
7823,1992-93,I propose to rationalise and restructure the excise duty on cotton yarn and cellulosic spun yarn.
7824,1992-93,"On cotton yarn, I propose to reduce the multiplicity of rates by having only five duty slabs."
7825,1992-93,Excise duty on cellulosic spun yarn is also being similarly rationalised by having three slabs.
7826,1992-93,"I also propose to raise the basic excise duty on viscose fibre from Rs  10.50 to Rs 12 per kg., on viscose filament yarn from Rs  12 to Rs 15 per kg., and on acrylic fibre from Rs  9.24 to Rs 12 per kg."
7827,1992-93,The duty rates on polyester blended yarns are also being rationalised.
7828,1992-93,Rags and synthetic waste are both raw materials for the shoddy woollen industry.
7829,1992-93,I propose to equate the import duty incidence on both at 110%.
7830,1992-93,"As a measure of relief, I propose to reduce the excise duty on nylon filament yarn from Rs  63 to Rs 55 per kg and also to reduce the import duty on caprolactum from 80% to 50%."
7831,1992-93,I also propose to reduce the excise duty on polyester filament yarn from Rs 70 to Rs 62 per kg.
7832,1992-93,"Similarly, jute products manufactured in rural areas by registered cooperative societies, women’s cooperatives, etc. are also proposed to be fully exempted from excise duty."
7833,1992-93,"Over the years, for administrative reasons, ad valorem duties have been steadily replaced by specific rates or ad valoremcum specific rates."
7834,1992-93,"Ad valorem duties are preferable to specific duties as they ensure buoyancy in revenue on account of increase in prices, and the Chelliah Committee has recommended switching over to ad valorem rates for a number of commodities."
7835,1992-93,"It has also recommended that where specific rates are retained, the same should be revised every year taking into account the price inflation."
7836,1992-93,I propose to make a modest beginning by switching over to the ad valorem mode of levy where feasible.
7837,1992-93,"As regards iron and steel, the excise duty on primary and semifinished forms thereof is generally charged at specific rates of duty."
7838,1992-93,"For administrative reasons, I propose to retain the specific rates of excise duty on items like ingots and certain rolled products like bars, rods, etc., other than of stainless steel."
7839,1992-93,"In respect of these products, I propose to raise the existing rates, which are presently between Rs  300 and Rs  1800 per metric ton to rates between Rs  400 and Rs  2000 per metric ton."
7840,1992-93,"However, in respect of iron forgings and other steel products, I propose to prescribe a uniform excise duty of 10%."
7841,1992-93,The proposals involve a revenue gain of about Rs 400 crores.
7842,1992-93,This injury to health is continuing and I would be failing in my duty if I did not make one more attempt to use the fiscal instrument in this worthy cause.
7843,1992-93,"While I do not propose to increase the duty on nonfilter cigarettes of less than 60 mm in length, the duties on all other cigarettes are being raised by Rs 30 to Rs 100 per thousand depending on the length."
7844,1992-93,The gain in revenue from the proposals is of the order of Rs 325 crores.
7845,1992-93,The revenue gain from the proposal is Rs  165 crores.
7846,1992-93,I propose to raise the rate to 10%.
7847,1992-93,The revenue gain from the proposal is estimated to be Rs  12 crores.
7848,1992-93,"The excise duty on cement produced in mini cement plants will also go up from Rs  90 to Rs 165 per metric ton, thus maintaining the existing duty differential of Rs  125 per metric ton in favour of mini cement plants."
7849,1992-93,"However, I propose to reduce the duty on white cement from 40% to 35% to bring the incidence closer to that on ordinary cement."
7850,1992-93,The estimated revenue gain from these proposals is Rs  376 crores.
7851,1992-93,The revenue gain on account of the proposal is estimated to be Rs  35 crores.
7852,1992-93,The proposal would yield an additional revenue of Rs  50 crores.
7853,1992-93,I propose to rationalise the duty structure by levying a uniform duty of 15% on all twowheelers of engine capacity upto 75 cc and 25% on all others whose engine capacity exceeds 75 cc.
7854,1992-93,I also propose to increase the excise duty on light commercial vehicles from 10% to 15%.
7855,1992-93,The proposals involve a revenue gain of Rs 80 crores.
7856,1992-93,The proposal involves a revenue gain of Rs  24 crores.
7857,1992-93,The additional revenue from the proposal is expected to be of the order of Rs  60 crores.
7858,1992-93,"However, I propose to reduce the duty on moped tyres from Rs  30 to Rs 25 per tyre."
7859,1992-93,The proposals involve a revenue gain of Rs  40 crores.
7860,1992-93,"In addition, high speed diesel oil and two wheelers attract special excise duty at 5%."
7861,1992-93,I now propose to raise the special excise duty on products which are presently attracting a 10% rate of duty to 15%.
7862,1992-93,"However, this increase will not be applicable to petroleum products."
7863,1992-93,"I also propose to exempt from this increase certain consumer durables like motor cars and consumer electronics such as television sets, as these industries are passing through a difficult phase."
7864,1992-93,This proposal involves a revenue gain of Rs 1025 crores.
7865,1992-93,"While a uniform pattern of incentive is generally to be preferred, there is a case for introducing some disincentives for exports of certain primary products where the same product can be easily exported in value added form."
7866,1992-93,I propose to impose an export duty of 10% on exports of certain types of finished leather and on unpolished granite in order to encourage exporters to shift to leather products and polished granite.
7867,1992-93,I am also imposing an export duty of 5% on iron ore.
7868,1992-93,The proposals are expected to yield an additional revenue of Rs 142 crores.
7869,1992-93,These amendments are generally enabling provisions and have no revenue significance.
7870,1992-93,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
7871,1992-93,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
7872,1992-93,The concessions and reliefs announced aggregate to Rs  304.80 crores.
7873,1992-93,"Out of the net additional sharable revenue from excise duties of Rs  2210.90 crores, the Centre’s share would be Rs  1146.53 crores and the States’ share Rs  1064.37 crores."
7874,1992-93,Since the loss in customs duties falls entirely on the Centre whereas the gain in excise revenue is shared with the States the impact on the Centre’s revenue is a loss of Rs  876.82 crores while the States will gain as much as Rs  1064.37 crores.
7875,1992-93,Consequently the estimated year end budget deficit of the Centre for 199293 will be Rs 5389 crores and the fiscal deficit for that year will be Rs 34408 crores.
7876,1992-93,India’s development is of tremendous significance for the future of the developing world.
7877,1992-93,"To realise our development potential, we have to unshackle the human spirit of creativity, idealism, adventure and enterprise that our people possess in abundant measure."
7878,1992-93,We have to harness all our latent 25 resources for a second industrial revolution and a second agricultural revolution.
7879,1992-93,"Our economy, polity and society have to be extraordinarily resilient and alert if we are to take full advantage of the opportunities and to minimise the risks associated with the increasing globalisation of economic processes."
7880,1992-93,We have to accept the need for reform if we are to avoid an increasing marginalisation of India in the evolving world economy.
7881,1992-93,The economic policy changes brought about by our Government in the last eight months are inspired by this vision.
7882,1992-93,Our party is an inheritor of great traditions of national service.
7883,1992-93,"True to this heritage, we commit ourselves to providing a firm and purposeful sense of direction to the reform process so that this ancient land of India regains its glory and rightful place in the comity of nations."
7884,1992-93,"This budget represents a contribution to the successful implementation of this great national enterprise, of building an India free from the fear of war, want and exploitation, an India worthy of the dreams of the founding fathers of our republic."
7885,1992-93,"We shall pay any price, bear any burden, make any sacrifice to realise those dreams."
7886,1992-93,India is on the move again.
7887,1992-93,We shall make the future happen.
7888,1993-94,I rise to present the budget for 199394.
7889,1993-94,It is now twenty months since our government took office: twenty eventful months in which we have worked ceaselessly to overcome the very difficult economic situation we inherited.
7890,1993-94,"In June, 1991, the economy was in the throes of an unprecedented balance of payments crisis."
7891,1993-94,A savage squeeze had been imposed on imports; international confidence had collapsed; industrial production was falling; and inflation was on the rise.
7892,1993-94,We have restored a measure of normalcy to our external payments.
7893,1993-94,"The annual rate of inflation has been reduced from the peak of 17% in August, 1991 to below 7%."
7894,1993-94,International confidence has been restored.
7895,1993-94,Agriculture has performed well in the current year and industrial production is beginning to recover.
7896,1993-94,"The growth of the economy, which had declined to 1.2% in 199192, is expected to be around 4% in 199293."
7897,1993-94,"The economic strategy we have followed, resting on the twin pillars of fiscal discipline and structural reform, has been vindicated by the decisive upturn."
7898,1993-94,"The rising fiscal deficits of the Central Government were the root cause of our balance of payments problem, rising prices and high rates of interest."
7899,1993-94,We have made good progress by reducing the fiscal deficit from 8.4% of GDP in 199091 to about 5% in the current year.
7900,1993-94,Policies of structural reform aimed at increasing efficiency in resource use and improving our international competitiveness were crucial for providing a lasting solution to the payments crisis.
7901,1993-94,"It was necessary to restructure our trade and industrial policies, encourage efficiency through greater domestic competition, allow our producers to have access to imports at reasonable rates of duty, encourage foreign investment and upgradation of technology, and progressively integrate the Indian economy with the world economy."
7902,1993-94,"Without these reforms, India would face the certain prospect of entering the 21st century as just about the poorest country 1 199394 2 in Asia."
7903,1993-94,I am convinced that the Indian people would never tolerate such an outcome.
7904,1993-94,India’s natural and human resources entitle us to think in terms of becoming a major powerhouse of the world economy.
7905,1993-94,Our reforms are inspired precisely by this vision.
7906,1993-94,The policy initiatives we have taken do not in any way reduce our commitment to take care of the poor and the disadvantaged.
7907,1993-94,"On the contrary, we have taken steps to minimise the burden of adjustment on the poor and working classes."
7908,1993-94,We have disproved those professional prophets of gloom who were predicting millions of people becoming unemployed.
7909,1993-94,"When we embarked on this path, we knew that the benefit of our policies would only be seen after three to four years."
7910,1993-94,"Nevertheless, Honourable Members can take comfort that the early results are certainly encouraging."
7911,1993-94,Inflation is down and production is beginning to recover.
7912,1993-94,Fears of being swamped by imports as a consequence of liberalisation have proved to be grossly exaggerated.
7913,1993-94,"Despite the virtual removal of import licensing in 1992 93, total imports in 199293 in US dollars are likely to be lower than in 199091."
7914,1993-94,"Although the rupee has been floated for most current account transactions, the market exchange rate has remained relatively stable."
7915,1993-94,The investment climate has improved considerably.
7916,1993-94,"Corporate capital issues by nonGovernment public limited companies in AprilOctober, 1992 were 67 percent higher than in the same period of the previous year."
7917,1993-94,Loans sanctioned by financial institutions in the first ten months of 199293 were 49% higher than in the same period of the previous year.
7918,1993-94,"Foreign investors are showing active interest in investment in many sectors, including critical infrastructure sectors such as power and petroleum."
7919,1993-94,Since August 1991 the approvals given for foreign investment proposals upto the end of January amount to an equity investment of $ 2.3 billion.
7920,1993-94,"These are of course only approvals at this stage and actual flows will take time to materialise, but they certainly indicate a substantial potential for larger investment inflows in the future."
7921,1993-94,"Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency."
7922,1993-94,Fiscal imbalances are still large.
7923,1993-94,The efficiency and resource generating capacity of public sector enterprises are still very inadequate.
7924,1993-94,Inflationary expectations have not yet been purged from the system and inflationary pressure could easily build up again if fiscal discipline is relaxed.
7925,1993-94,The economy is still vulnerable to external shocks and loss of confidence.
7926,1993-94,"The riots and disturbances in December and January have also taken their toll, by disrupting domestic production and exports and by casting doubts about the stability of our polity and society and our determination to persevere with the difficult task of economic reform."
7927,1993-94,We can ill afford such doubts.
7928,1993-94,"The priorities for economic policy, at this critical stage of our economic restructuring, are very clear: · We must continue with the fiscal correction to ensure that inflationary expectations are effectively curbed; to this end, the fiscal deficit both at the Centre and in the States must be further reduced as a percentage of GDP."
7929,1993-94,"The room for fiscal maneuver gained by restraining expenditure over the past two years must be used to give a strong fillip to development expenditure in 199394, especially for programmes of poverty alleviation, 3 rural development and the vital social services such as education and health."
7930,1993-94,"The hesitant industrial recovery must be converted into a strong revival in 199394, which can then be followed by a vigorous boom in the last three years of the Eighth Plan."
7931,1993-94,"We must make further progress with our announced strategy of tax reform, moving to a simpler tax system, with moderate rates and much greater focus on compliance."
7932,1993-94,"Finally, exports must be made a truly high priority national endeavour so that we can move as quickly as possible to managing the balance of payments without the need for continued exceptional financing from abroad."
7933,1993-94,This is the only meaningful route to selfreliance.
7934,1993-94,"The expenditure and tax proposals for 199394, which I will be presenting shortly, have been tailored to meet these objectives."
7935,1993-94,Adequate availability of credit at reasonable rates of interest will be critical in converting this year’s weak industrial recovery into a strong revival next year.
7936,1993-94,One factor behind the inadequacy of credit for the commercial sector is the preemption of a large proportion of banks’ resources by the government at below market rates of interest through the Statutory Liquidity Ratio SLR.
7937,1993-94,In 199293 we began the process of reducing the SLR in order to release a larger volume of resources for commercial lending.
7938,1993-94,Our objective is to reduce the SLR further from an effective average level of about 36 percent at present to about 25% over the next 3 years.
7939,1993-94,"The precise phasing of the reduction will be announced by Reserve Bank of India, taking into account the emerging aggregate monetary and credit situation."
7940,1993-94,The reduction in inflation achieved thus far justifies a reduction in interest rates.
7941,1993-94,"Accordingly, the Reserve Bank of India is separately notifying a reduction in the maximum interest rate on bank deposits from 12% to 11%."
7942,1993-94,"Simultaneously, the minimum lending rate of 18% on commercial advances is being lowered to 17%."
7943,1993-94,It is my expectation that the lowering of interest rates will help the economic recovery in the coming year.
7944,1993-94,"As inflation abates, there will be scope for further reduction in interest rates."
7945,1993-94,No economic strategy can succeed in our country which does not recognise the central role of agriculture in supporting broadbased and equitable development.
7946,1993-94,"The government is firmly committed to ensuring that agriculture, agroprocessing and rural development are given top priority in the design of economic policy."
7947,1993-94,A major instrument for encouraging agricultural production and making it profitable is the assurance of remunerative prices to the farmers.
7948,1993-94,Procurement prices for the last kharif crop and the forthcoming rabi have been handsomely raised to ensure that farmers are compensated for increases in the cost of inputs.
7949,1993-94,It is also the policy of the Government not to place administrative restrictions on 4 movements of agricultural products within the country.
7950,1993-94,Our farmers must have the full benefit of prices available in the domestic market.
7951,1993-94,"Agricultural credit is another critical input for agricultural, and more broadly, rural development."
7952,1993-94,"The flow of rural credit from institutional sources is expected to jump from Rs 13,800 crore during 199293 to Rs 16,500 crore during 199394, an increase of 20%."
7953,1993-94,"NABARD’s investment refinance support to banks will increase by 22% from Rs 2,300 crore in the current year to Rs 2,800 crore in 199394."
7954,1993-94,"Within this total, NABARD has evolved an innovative package of measures to ensure special attention to priority areas."
7955,1993-94,Term loans for minor irrigation will support the sinking of 3.75 lakh wells and installation of 6 lakh pump sets.
7956,1993-94,The rate of NABARD refinance of bank loans is being increased to 90% in the case of North Eastern States and also of investments in 100% export oriented units in agriculture and allied activities.
7957,1993-94,NABARD will also take up pilot projects for intensive development of rural industries in five selected districts with an outlay of Rs 125 crore.
7958,1993-94,"NABARD is setting up a Venture Capital Fund, with an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore, to assist new and innovative investments in farm and nonfarm sectors, and a Cooperative Development Fund with an initial corpus of Rs 10 crore to help improve management systems and skills in cooperative banks."
7959,1993-94,"In 199394, we shall pay special attention to revitalising the agricultural credit system so that it becomes a more effective instrument for increasing capital formation and productivity of agriculture."
7960,1993-94,"Our strategy of gradually reducing the high levels of protection to Indian industry, and integrating our economy with the world economy, will clearly help Indian agriculture."
7961,1993-94,It will moderate the high industrial prices which the farmer has to pay.
7962,1993-94,"It will also ensure a more competitive exchange rate, at which our agricultural and agrobased exports will be much more profitable."
7963,1993-94,"I venture to suggest to Honourable Members that in the medium run, these changes will be far more significant in favouring agricultural producers than any programme of special subsidies could ever be."
7964,1993-94,In my Budget speech last year I had indicated that the Government intended to implement the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee on financial sector reform in stages.
7965,1993-94,The securities scam which was discovered in April 1992 has revealed certain weaknesses which add urgency to the need for financial sector reform.
7966,1993-94,"A major reform initiated last year was the introduction of new norms for income recognition, and provisioning for bad debts and the prescription of new capital adequacy requirements in line with internationally accepted Basle Committee norms."
7967,1993-94,The new norms will ensure that the books of the banks will reflect their financial position more accurately and in accordance with internationally accepted accounting practices.
7968,1993-94,These changes will improve our ability to evaluate the performance of the banks and will also make for more effective bank supervision.
7969,1993-94,"Because of the new norms, however, banks will have to make large provisions amounting to over Rs 10,000 crore for bad and doubtful advances in their portfolios."
7970,1993-94,"As the provisioning norms are being introduced in two stages, the first impact will be felt in the year ending 31 March 1993, with a further impact next year."
7971,1993-94,"The resulting losses will eat into the capital of the banks, which is already inadequate given the new capital adequacy norms."
7972,1993-94,"In order to protect the 5 viability and financial health of the Indian banking system I am making provision for a large capital contribution of Rs 5,700 crore to the nationalised banks in 1993 94 to meet the gap created by the application of the first stage of the provisioning norms."
7973,1993-94,"There will be no immediate net outgo from the budget, as the Government’s contribution is in the form of Government bonds; but the interest payment on these bonds, and their ultimate redemption will be a real burden on the budget in future."
7974,1993-94,This is the price we have to pay for having long tolerated management practices in the banks and types of lending which paid inadequate attention to portfolio quality and recoveries.
7975,1993-94,"I may add that while undertaking such a large injection of capital into the banks, specific commitments will be required from each bank to ensure that their future management practices ensure a high level of portfolio quality so that the earlier problem does not recur."
7976,1993-94,Even this large injection of capital will only solve the immediate problem.
7977,1993-94,Additional losses will arise because of the second stage of provisioning next year.
7978,1993-94,"Besides, the capital adequacy requirements are also being introduced in a phased manner and there will be additional capital needs on this account in 199495 and 199596."
7979,1993-94,"This burden cannot be borne entirely by the budget without eating into scarce resources which are desperately needed for development, especially in the rural areas."
7980,1993-94,"Government has, therefore, decided that the State Bank of India, as well as other nationalised banks which are in a position to do so, will be allowed to access the capital markets to raise fresh equity to meet their shortfall in capital requirements over the next three years."
7981,1993-94,The additional capital thus moblised will help our banks to expand their lending which would otherwise be constrained by capital inadequacy.
7982,1993-94,"Government will, continue to retain majority ownership, and therefore effective control, in the public sector banks."
7983,1993-94,Necessary legislation to give effect to this decision will be introduced later in the year.
7984,1993-94,"If banks are to make provisions for bad debts, they must also be able to realise the security on their bad debts."
7985,1993-94,"At present the legal process for realising bank dues is tortuous, and cases take several years in the courts."
7986,1993-94,"Government has, therefore, decided to set up Special Tribunals to expedite legal action by the banks to enforce recoveries."
7987,1993-94,Legislation to this effect will be introduced in the course of the year.
7988,1993-94,The securities scam has also revealed weaknesses in the existing system of supervision of banks.
7989,1993-94,"Following the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee, Reserve Bank of India has decided to strengthen its supervisory arrangements by setting up a separate Board for Financial Supervision within the Reserve Bank."
7990,1993-94,Parallel with reforms in the banking system we are vigorously pursuing reforms in the capital markets.
7991,1993-94,We must ensure that trading and settlement take place with speed and transparency under appropriate rules and regulations designed to ensure investor protection.
7992,1993-94,"The Securities and Exchange Board of India, which was given statutory status and powers twelve months ago, has been entrusted with the task of bringing about this transition."
7993,1993-94,"As promised in my last Budget speech, the office of the Controller of Capital Issues in the Ministry of Finance has been abolished, and almost all powers under the Securities Contract Regulations Act have been delegated or transferred to SEBI."
7994,1993-94,Several important steps have been taken in the current year to reform the capital market.
7995,1993-94,"Rules and regulations have been notified to deal with insider trading, the operation of mutual funds, registration of brokers, merchant bankers and other intermediaries."
7996,1993-94,The scheme for allowing Foreign Institutional Investors to invest in the capital markets announced in my last Budget speech has been implemented and a number of approvals given.
7997,1993-94,Several private sector mutual funds have recently been given clearances by SEBI.
7998,1993-94,A company has been incorporated for the establishment of a National Stock Exchange which is expected to operate as a model stock exchange with member brokers all over the country trading in the exchange through modern telecommunication facilities.
7999,1993-94,Proposals are also being considered for the establishment of a centralised depository with a National Clearance and Settlement System.
8000,1993-94,We are determined to ensure that further reforms of the capital market are implemented in the course of 199394 so that the capital market can mobilise large funds for investment.
8001,1993-94,"On the basis of experience gained, the Government has decided to amend the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act to give SEBI additional powers in order to increase its effectiveness."
8002,1993-94,"With reforms underway in the banking sector and in the capital markets, it is necessary to address the need for similar reforms in the insurance industry aimed at introducing a more competitive environment subject to suitable regulation and supervision."
8003,1993-94,I propose to appoint a High Powered Committee to go into these issues in depth and submit its recommendations within six months.
8004,1993-94,"In my Budget speech last year, I announced the introduction of a new system of exchange rate management under which a dual exchange rate regime was introduced, and import licensing was eliminated on most items of capital goods, raw materials, intermediates and components."
8005,1993-94,These items became freely importable against foreign exchange purchased in the market.
8006,1993-94,The system has worked fairly well and the market exchange rate has been remarkably stable.
8007,1993-94,"The existence of a dual rate, however, hurts exporters and other foreign exchange earners who have to surrender 40% of their earnings at the official rate, getting the benefit of the higher market rate on only 60 percent."
8008,1993-94,Many exporters have said that this amounts to a tax on exporters of goods and services whose continuation cannot be justified at a time when exports must receive our fullest support.
8009,1993-94,"There is merit in this point of view, and the experience of the past year gives ground for confidence that we can unify the exchange rate and still manage the balance of payments with a reasonable degree of stability in the exchange rate."
8010,1993-94,The Government has therefore decided to eliminate the dual rate arrangement.
8011,1993-94,"All exporters, as well as other foreign exchange earners such as our workers abroad, will henceforth be allowed to convert 100% of their earnings at the market rate."
8012,1993-94,All imports will also henceforth have to be paid for at the market rate.
8013,1993-94,The details of the new system are being notified separately by Reserve Bank of India.
8014,1993-94,"I expect that this will give a major boost to exports, and will further encourage foreign exchange flows into official channels."
8015,1993-94,Several other steps are also being taken to stimulate exports.
8016,1993-94,The Commerce Ministry is reviewing the list of items whose exports are subject to one or other restriction with a view to removing as many restrictions as possible.
8017,1993-94,Reserve Bank of India is taking steps to ensure that adequate credit will be available for exports.
8018,1993-94,Banks have already been asked to ensure that export credit amounts to at least 7 10% of their total advances.
8019,1993-94,The interest rate on rupee export credit is being reduced by one percentage point.
8020,1993-94,"As a further measure of support for exports, the interest tax will be waived in the case of export credit from banks."
8021,1993-94,I will have more to say on incentives for exporters when I come to the tax proposals in the Budget.
8022,1993-94,"A new policy towards foreign investment has been an integral part of our strategy of modernising the economy, and establishing global linkages which will be of critical importance in the emerging world economy."
8023,1993-94,I have already mentioned that the initiatives taken in this area thus far have yielded encouraging results.
8024,1993-94,"I have no doubt that as our reforms proceed and gain momentum, we can expect to attract a substantial share of the private investment that is presently flowing to many developing countries in Asia."
8025,1993-94,The Government has signed the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency MIGA convention and we expect to join MIGA formally as soon as membership procedures are completed.
8026,1993-94,"Several countries, including the UK, Germany and the United States, have expressed an interest in signing bilateral investment treaties."
8027,1993-94,The Government has indicated a willingness to enter into bilateral negotiations on this issue.
8028,1993-94,"Industrial modernisation, and especially the creation of internationally competitive industries, requires a massive expansion of and qualitative improvement in infrastructure."
8029,1993-94,"This is especially true of power generation, telecommunications and roads."
8030,1993-94,"Traditionally, these areas have been the preserve of the public sector."
8031,1993-94,Substantial expansion of public investment in these areas is certainly necessary.
8032,1993-94,"However, the needs of the country are far beyond the capacity of the public sector to deliver in a reasonable time frame."
8033,1993-94,"The Government has, therefore, adopted a policy of encouraging private sector involvement and participation in these areas to supplement the efforts being made by the public sector."
8034,1993-94,"In order to attract such investment it will be necessary to make changes in policies, procedures and the regulatory framework in these sectors."
8035,1993-94,The Government proposes to make such changes as the need arises.
8036,1993-94,"Over the past two years, we have taken several steps to remove unnecessary bureaucratic interference in economic activity in order to create an environment in which the energies of our people can be harnessed to maximise innovation, production and growth."
8037,1993-94,"However, I am constantly told that despite liberalisation at the policy level, our procedures in many areas remain archaic and cumbersome."
8038,1993-94,Many of our laws also need thorough review to bring them in line with the emerging economic environment.
8039,1993-94,The Government has therefore decided that a special review group will be constituted in each Ministry to make a review of existing laws and procedures to identify changes needed in the light of the new policies.
8040,1993-94,I hope the State Governments which have a crucial role to play in promoting development and investment in the new environment will also take similar steps at their end.
8041,1993-94,Let me now turn to the revised estimates for 199293.
8042,1993-94,"We have tried to maintain strict control over expenditure, but certain increases over the Budget estimates were unavoidable."
8043,1993-94,"An additional provision of Rs 1,500 crore has to be made for food, fertiliser and export subsidies."
8044,1993-94,The additional requirement of food subsidy is because of the delay in increasing issue prices to absorb the impact of higher procurement prices.
8045,1993-94,The higher provision for export subsidy is because of settlement of claims in the pipeline for cash compensatory support and continuance of benefits for deemed exports.
8046,1993-94,In respect of fertilisers the 8 increase is due to the reduction in prices of urea and higher input costs.
8047,1993-94,"In addition, I have provided Rs 340 crore as onetime assistance to farmers for purchase of fertilisers whose prices were decontrolled."
8048,1993-94,Ministry of Home Affairs has to be provided additional funds for meeting securityrelated expenditure in the wake of disturbed conditions in certain parts of the country.
8049,1993-94,"While an assessment of the actual requirements is being made, I have for the present included in the Revised Estimates an additional provision of Rs 285 crore."
8050,1993-94,"If a further provision becomes inescapable, we shall come to the House for the necessary Supplementary Grants."
8051,1993-94,"These and other increases have been offset by a reduction of Rs 1,300 crore in the requirements for loans to States against small savings collections."
8052,1993-94,The decline in small savings collections has been a matter of concern and Government has taken measures to improve the rate of return to the investors.
8053,1993-94,"As a consequence, the collections have shown an uptrend in recent months."
8054,1993-94,"As a result of all these developments, total nonplan expenditure is higher by Rs 3,278 crore as compared with the budget estimates."
8055,1993-94,"On the plan side, there is an increase in budgetary support for the Central Plan for certain sectors."
8056,1993-94,"An additional provision of Rs 630 crore is being made for the National Renewal Fund, which is a key element in our strategy for economic reforms."
8057,1993-94,Similarly an additional provision of Rs 250 crore has been made for strengthening schemes in the social sectors such as Health and Family Welfare.
8058,1993-94,The provision for Rural Development is being augmented by Rs 500 crore.
8059,1993-94,"Central assistance to State and Union Territory Plans is being augmented by Rs 1,228 crore mainly for externally aided projects where the pace of implementation justifies an allocation larger than in the Budget Estimates."
8060,1993-94,"Taking Plan and nonPlan expenditures together, the total provision in the Revised Estimates is Rs 1,24,726 crore against Rs 1,19,087 crore in the Budget Estimates."
8061,1993-94,"Against these additional expenditures, revenue receipts have also been higher because of better collections and higher royalty on offshore crude oil."
8062,1993-94,"Capital receipts under market loans and small savings receipts are lower than in the Budget Estimates; but this is offset by the higher receipts from 364days treasury bills, which is a new instrument designed to develop a market for Government securities."
8063,1993-94,"The total receipts in the Revised Estimates are Rs 1,17,524 crore compared to Rs 1,13,698 crore in the Budget Estimates."
8064,1993-94,"The Budget deficit is estimated at Rs 7,202 crore and the fiscal deficit for the year is now placed at Rs 36,722 crore."
8065,1993-94,These figures are somewhat higher than envisaged in the Budget Estimates but within tolerable limits for macroeconomic stability.
8066,1993-94,I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 199394.
8067,1993-94,The resource constraints facing us last year imposed a tight leash on the development programmes we could finance in 199293.
8068,1993-94,The total size of the Central Plan in 199293 BE was only 12.6% higher than in the previous year.
8069,1993-94,"With the improvement in the fiscal situation achieved in the course of 199293, and the moderation in inflation, we are now in a position to give a boost to the Plan, while ensuring continued improvement in the fiscal deficit."
8070,1993-94,"Accordingly, the Central Plan outlay for 199394 has been fixed at Rs 63,936 crore which is almost 32% higher than the figure of Rs 48,407 crore in 199293."
8071,1993-94,"The Central Plan will be financed to the extent of Rs 23,241 crore from budget support which is almost 26 per cent higher than the budget support of Rs 18,501 crore in 199293."
8072,1993-94,"The balance of the Central Plan outlay of Rs 40,695 crore will be met from internal and extrabudgetary resources compared with Rs 29,906 crore in 199293, representing a stepup of 36%."
8073,1993-94,"I am providing Rs 18,010 crore for Central assistance for States and UT Plans in 199394 compared to Rs 16,111 crore in 199293."
8074,1993-94,"The total budgetary support from the Central Government Budget to the Central and State Plans increases by almost 19% from Rs 34,612 crore in 199293 to Rs 41,251 crore in 199394."
8075,1993-94,The large increase in budget support for the Plan has enabled a substantial stepup in Central Plan programmes in the social sectors and rural development which depend upon budgetary resources.
8076,1993-94,"The outlay for the Department of Rural Development next year has been enhanced by a massive 62% to Rs 5,010 crore."
8077,1993-94,Both employment generation and capital formation in rural areas will receive a major boost.
8078,1993-94,"The allocation for the Jawahar Rojgar Yojana is being increased to Rs 3,306 crore compared with the current year’s level of Rs 2,046 crore."
8079,1993-94,This is aimed at creating 1100 million mandays of employment.
8080,1993-94,It is proposed to train 3.5 lakh young persons in rural areas under the Training of Rural Youth for Self Employment TRYSEM programme.
8081,1993-94,"For the rural water supply programme, the provision has been increased substantially from Rs 460 crore in 199293 to Rs 740 crore next year."
8082,1993-94,Higher allocations have also been provided for the Integrated Rural Development Programme.
8083,1993-94,"The programmes of decentralised planning and development will receive a massive stimulus as a result of the strengthening of Panchayati Raj institutions as envisaged in the Constitution 72nd Amendment Bill, 1991."
8084,1993-94,The development of human resources is given high priority in the Eighth Plan; Hon’ble Members are also aware that education is an area which is very close to my heart.
8085,1993-94,"I am, therefore, particularly happy to announce that the outlay for education is being increased from Rs 952 crore to Rs 1,310 crore, which is a step up of 37.6%."
8086,1993-94,"Universal provision of primary education and adult literacy of satisfactory quality, particularly for girls and women, is a prerequisite for the modernisation of the economy and the society."
8087,1993-94,"I am happy to inform Honourable Members that our total literacy campaigns are breaking new grounds, and are now being implemented in 182 districts covering approximately 430 lakh adult learners."
8088,1993-94,"A new scheme is being launched for the improvement of primary education in educationally backward districts and in districts where the total literacy campaigns have been successful, leading to an enhanced demand for primary education."
8089,1993-94,"In these districts, districts specific and population specific plans for achieving universalisation of elementary education are being prepared."
8090,1993-94,"Twenty to twentyfive districts out of about 200 educationally backward districts where female literacy is below national average, will be taken up for preparation of districts plans in 1993 94."
8091,1993-94,"In the sphere of higher and technical education, modernisation and upgradation would receive high priority."
8092,1993-94,"Keeping in view the aspirations of the North Eastern region, the government has decided to setup a university in Nagaland and an Indian Institute of Technology in Assam 43."
8093,1993-94,"For Health, the provision is Rs 483 crore, which is 60% higher than the level of Rs 302 crore in the current year’s Budget."
8094,1993-94,A major part of the provision will be for national programmes for control of communicable and other diseases.
8095,1993-94,"The Family Welfare programme is of overriding national importance; the provision under 10 this head is being stepped up from Rs 1,000 crore for the current year to Rs 1,270 crore for the next year."
8096,1993-94,"A programme to improve the quality of family planning services in Uttar Pradesh is being launched at a cost of US $ 325 million, with assistance from USAID."
8097,1993-94,"In addition, with the aim of reducing maternal mortality, under the Social Safety Net Scheme, assistance will be provided for improvement of infrastructure at Primary Health Centres in 90 demographically backward districts."
8098,1993-94,The National Commission for Women set up last year is looking into various important issues relating to women.
8099,1993-94,For the integrated child development services the provision is Rs 474 crore compared to Rs 360 crore in the current year.
8100,1993-94,This will enable us to strengthen the infrastructure set up of the scheme.
8101,1993-94,The provision for the Ministry of Welfare has been increased from Rs 530 crore to Rs 630 crore.
8102,1993-94,This includes Rs 73 crore for the liberation and rehabilitation of Safai Karmcharis.
8103,1993-94,A provision of Rs 247 crore has been made for special Central assistance for Scheduled Castes component plan.
8104,1993-94,The operations of the National Scheduled Castes Finance and Development Corporation and the National Backward Classes Finance and Development Corporation will be further expanded.
8105,1993-94,The Government regards agriculture as a sector of prime importance for the national economy.
8106,1993-94,"The budgetary allocation for the plan schemes of the Ministry of Agriculture including Animal Husbandry and Dairying is being increased by 36% from Rs 1,408 crore to Rs 1,918 crore."
8107,1993-94,"In addition, the bulk of the outlay on agriculture is in the State Plans."
8108,1993-94,"The requirements of the infrastructure sectors such as Petroleum and Natural Gas, Power, Telecommunications, Railways and Transport have also not been neglected."
8109,1993-94,Investment programmes in these sectors are implemented through public enterprises or departmentally run commercial undertakings and these organisations are expected to finance their plan outlay through their internal and extra budgetary resources.
8110,1993-94,"The plan outlay for Petroleum and Natural Gas has been nearly doubled to Rs 12,114 crore from the current year’s level of Rs 6,208 crore."
8111,1993-94,"The outlay for Power has been increased by 22% from Rs 5,167 crore in the current year to Rs 6,269 crore."
8112,1993-94,The outlay for Roads has been stepped up from Rs 464 crore to Rs 593 crore.
8113,1993-94,"The outlay for Chemicals and Petrochemicals has also been stepped up from Rs 763 crore to Rs 1,206 crore."
8114,1993-94,"The Plan outlay for the Railways has been increased from Rs 5,700 crore to Rs 6,900 crore including Rs 400 crore for the Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. 47."
8115,1993-94,"Turning to nonPlan expenditure, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the tremendous burden of interest payments."
8116,1993-94,"The provision for 199394 is Rs 38,000 crore compared with Rs 32,500 crore in the current year."
8117,1993-94,"The high interest burden is due to the rising volume of government debt, which itself reflects the large fiscal deficits, incurred year after year."
8118,1993-94,"However, with the reduction in the fiscal deficit and hence in the Government’s borrowings, the growth of this item is expected to decelerate sharply by 199596."
8119,1993-94,"For Defence expenditure the provision has been increased from Rs 17,500 crore in the current year to Rs 19,180 crore next year."
8120,1993-94,The requirements on account of fertilisers and export subsidies will be significantly lower reflecting the impact of the measures already taken to rationalise these subsidies.
8121,1993-94,"The expenditure on the Farm Loan Waiver scheme will be Rs 500 crore; with this, the Government’s commitment for payment under the scheme will be fulfilled."
8122,1993-94,"I am providing Rs 3,000 11 crore for food subsidy as against Rs 2,800 crore in the current year."
8123,1993-94,It will be the endeavour of Government to keep the burden of food subsidy at a reasonable level and to ensure at the same time that the vulnerable sections of society are fully protected.
8124,1993-94,"Excluding the expenditure on interest, the provision for other nonplan expenditure in 199394 is about Rs 3,180 crore lower than the Revised Estimates for the current year."
8125,1993-94,"As in previous years, no separate provision is being made for additional dearness allowance which may become payable next year."
8126,1993-94,The additional expenditure on this account will have to be absorbed by all Ministries within the approved budget provision.
8127,1993-94,"Coming to receipts, gross tax revenues at the existing level of taxation are estimated at Rs  89,389 crore compared to Rs  78,782 crore in the current year."
8128,1993-94,"States’ share of taxes next year is estimated at Rs 22,590 crore as against Rs  20,525 crore in the current year’s Revised Estimates."
8129,1993-94,"I am taking a credit of Rs  3,700 crore for market borrowings as against the current year’s level of Rs  3,670 crore."
8130,1993-94,"External assistance, net of repayments, is estimated at Rs  6,819 crore as against Rs 5,374 crore in the current year."
8131,1993-94,"Net small savings collections next year are estimated to reach the current year’s level of Rs  5,500 crore despite heavy maturities falling due next year."
8132,1993-94,"As in the current year’s Revised Estimates, I am taking credit of Rs  3,500 crore for receipts from disinvestment of equity in public enterprises."
8133,1993-94,"Total receipts at the existing levels of taxation are estimated at Rs 130,990 crore and total expenditure at Rs 131,323 crore leaving a gap of Rs  333 crore."
8134,1993-94,I now turn to the tax proposals for 199394.
8135,1993-94,"In framing these proposals I have been acutely conscious of the conflicting requirements of comprehensive reform of the tax structure on the one hand, and the need to protect revenues to finance the large increase in the Plan, on the other."
8136,1993-94,Last year significant reforms were made in personal income taxation based on the recommendations of the Chelliah Committee.
8137,1993-94,Reform of corporate taxation was deferred until the detailed recommendations of the Chelliah Committee were received.
8138,1993-94,These have since been received.
8139,1993-94,"The Committee has also recently submitted its final report on indirect taxes, recommending significant reduction in customs duties as well as rationalisation and simplification of excise duties."
8140,1993-94,I accept the broad thrust of the Chelliah Committee’s recommendations on both direct and indirect taxes.
8141,1993-94,"We must move as rapidly as possible to a regime of moderate tax rates in direct taxation, which will encourage better compliance especially if supplemented by efforts at broadening of the tax base."
8142,1993-94,We must also move to a regime of low to moderate customs duties which is essential for efficient and competitive industrialisation.
8143,1993-94,Our excise duties should also be simplified with fewer rates and our longterm aim should be to move to a Value Added Tax System.
8144,1993-94,"However, a nationwide value added tax system cannot be introduced overnight."
8145,1993-94,There has to be a broad agreement among the Centre and the States on the design of such a system.
8146,1993-94,"In order to promote informed discussion and debate, I am requesting the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy to prepare the design of a possible value added tax system."
8147,1993-94,"Although all the major recommendations of the Chelliah Committee are important, they cannot be implemented immediately for the simple reason that tax reform, which typically involves lower tax rates collected on a broader base, often involves a loss of revenue in the short run."
8148,1993-94,"Fiscal experts tell us that the loss of revenue will be made up in the medium term, but there is no guarantee that this will happen immediately, and Finance Ministers have to look after the short term if they want to survive in the medium term."
8149,1993-94,I hope the House will agree with me that a phased transition is needed.
8150,1993-94,"A key issue in phasing the transition is whether to do a little on all fronts or to make decisive changes in certain areas, with a clear declaration of progress to be made in other areas in future."
8151,1993-94,I have thought over this matter carefully and I feel that decisive action in critical areas is more important than marginal improvements on all fronts.
8152,1993-94,The most critical area for action at present is customs duties.
8153,1993-94,"Despite the adjustments in customs duties in the last two budgets, our duties are still much higher than in most of our competitor countries, especially on capital goods."
8154,1993-94,"With these duties, and the resulting high capital costs, our producers will never be able to compete in world markets."
8155,1993-94,"Nor can we expect new investment, both domestic and foreign, to flow into areas with export markets in view, if high customs duties make them uncompetitive."
8156,1993-94,Yet it is such investments that we need most at present if we want to reduce our dependence on external assistance.
8157,1993-94,"We cannot and must not continue with the approach of setting up industries aimed solely at the domestic market in the belief that replacing imports ipso facto contributes to self reliance, without considering at what cost we are effecting the replacement."
8158,1993-94,"In fact, replacement at unduly high cost contributes to inefficient industrialisation, an inability to export and a permanent dependence on external assistance."
8159,1993-94,We must take a bold initiative in this area while taking due care to protect the legitimate concerns of our industry.
8160,1993-94,"Normally, the revenue loss from customs duty reduction could have been made up through higher excise duties."
8161,1993-94,"However, there are compelling reasons for rationalising and reducing excise duties over a wide range of industries because many of our duties are too high and parts of industry are also suffering from recessionary conditions."
8162,1993-94,"In these circumstances, Hon’ble Members will appreciate that I have limited room for maneuver in the area of direct taxes."
8163,1993-94,"Major reform of the corporate tax structure, along the lines recommended by the Chelliah Committee is undoubtedly desirable."
8164,1993-94,"However, for the reasons indicated, it will have to be postponed to the next year."
8165,1993-94,"I would like, however, to give a stimulus to new investment in those States in which all the districts are industrially backward."
8166,1993-94,"Accordingly, I propose to give a fiveyear tax holiday, commencing from the year of production, for new industrial undertakings located in all the NorthEastern States, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Sikkim, Goa and Union Territories of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu, Lakshadweep and Pondicherry."
8167,1993-94,Electricity is a critical input for the future growth of our economy.
8168,1993-94,I therefore propose to introduce a fiveyear tax holiday in respect of profits and gains of new industrial undertakings set up anywhere in India for either generation or generation and distribution of power.
8169,1993-94,The fiveyear tax holiday will begin from the year of generation of power.
8170,1993-94,"The fiveyear tax holiday, in both these cases, will be part of section 80 13 IA of the Incometax Act."
8171,1993-94,"At the end of the fiveyear period, these units will be entitled to the existing deduction under section 80IA for the remaining period."
8172,1993-94,"To promote a cleaner and healthier environment, I propose to allow depreciation admissible on plant and machinery relating to environment protection and pollution control at 100 per cent instead of the existing 40 per cent."
8173,1993-94,"Hitherto, our institutions of higher learning have been almost entirely dependent on Government funds."
8174,1993-94,"As government funds are limited, we must find ways of funding these institutions from industry."
8175,1993-94,This will also bring them closer to industry and more responsive to its needs.
8176,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to raise the income tax deduction given to contributions to approved universities, institutes of technology, institutes of management and equivalent institutions from 50 per cent."
8177,1993-94,"A strong science and technology base is an essential prerequisite for a modern, progressive economy."
8178,1993-94,"Indian scientists and technologists have proved, time and again, that they are second to none in the world, given the right work atmosphere, proper motivation and adequate facilities."
8179,1993-94,Indian industry needs to spend a lot more on research and development.
8180,1993-94,"In doing so, I would encourage industry to make use of the facilities offered by our national laboratories and research institutes."
8181,1993-94,"To that end, I propose to introduce a weighted deduction of 125 per cent."
8182,1993-94,"This weighted deduction will be available only for research programmes determined by the users and the producers of research, and approved by the prescribed authority."
8183,1993-94,"I propose to extend the fiveyear tax holiday under section 10A of the Incometax Act, at present available to units set up in the Free Trade Zones, to units set up in Software Technology Parks and Electronic Hardware Technology Parks."
8184,1993-94,"In July 1991, I had introduced a 100 per cent deduction for three years in respect of income derived from export of software."
8185,1993-94,"Under the scheme for permitting Foreign Institutional Investors in our capital market, we had indicated that such investors would be liable to tax at 20 per cent."
8186,1993-94,I also propose to extend a concessional rate of tax of 30 per cent in respect of shortterm capital gains for such investors.
8187,1993-94,"As I have already mentioned, a substantial reform of personal taxation was carried out last year based on the recommendations of the Chelliah Committee."
8188,1993-94,I propose to leave the rate structure and exemption limit unchanged and make only a few modifications.
8189,1993-94,"Last year, because of severe resource constraints, I was compelled to retain the surcharge on personal income above Rs 1 lakh at 12 per cent."
8190,1993-94,I had hoped to be able to remove the surcharge in the current year but I am constrained to continue with it for one more year.
8191,1993-94,"However, I propose to raise the standard deduction from salary income from Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000 and the standard deduction for working women with incomes upto Rs 75,000 from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000."
8192,1993-94,"In recognition of the hardship to old people in these days of inflation, I had given a tax rebate of 10 per cent last year to senior citizens whose gross total income is below Rs 50,000."
8193,1993-94,"I propose to raise the tax rebate to 20 per cent and further increase the income limit from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75,000. 67."
8194,1993-94,"Last year, I had announced that a scheme for giving Advance Rulings in respect of transactions involving nonresidents would be worked out."
8195,1993-94,"The scheme has been drawn up and I am bringing forward legislative proposals for the creation of a statutory authority, headed by a retired Judge of the Supreme Court."
8196,1993-94,I do hope that the scheme will be welcomed by nonresidents.
8197,1993-94,"I propose to extend the simplified scheme of presumptive taxation introduced last year to small road transport operators operating, hiring or leasing one transport vehicle."
8198,1993-94,Payments made under Voluntary Retirement Schemes to public sector employees were fully exempt from income tax; last year I extended this exemption to private sector employees.
8199,1993-94,I propose now to extend this facility to employees of statutory authorities and local authorities.
8200,1993-94,"Recognising the trauma of bringing up a handicapped child, I had, last year increased the deduction permissible for guardians of handicapped dependants under the incometax law from Rs 6000 to Rs 12000."
8201,1993-94,I now propose to further raise this deduction to Rs 15000.
8202,1993-94,"I also propose to allow a deduction in respect of income of handicapped minors clubbed with the income of their parent to the full extent of the child’s income upto a maximum of Rs 20,000."
8203,1993-94,"In my first Budget Speech in July 1991, I had proposed the setting up of the National Foundation for Communal Harmony to provide assistance to the children of families affected by communal riots."
8204,1993-94,The Foundation has since been established under the aegis of the Home Ministry.
8205,1993-94,I now propose to extend the benefit of 100 per cent.
8206,1993-94,I also propose to exempt the income of the National Foundation for Communal Harmony fully from income tax.
8207,1993-94,"At present, charitable trusts and institutions have to seek approval every three years from the Commissioner of Income tax in order that donations to them are eligible for tax exemption."
8208,1993-94,"To reduce paper work and simplify the procedure, I propose to increase the maximum period of approval by the Commissioner to five assessment years."
8209,1993-94,"I would like to see India gain prominence, not only in the global economy, but also in the world of sports."
8210,1993-94,There are provisions in the Incometax Act to allow exemption in respect of income of approved sports associations or institutions and to grant 50 per cent.
8211,1993-94,I propose to amend the Rules relating to eligible projects or schemes under section 35AC of the Act to include promotion of sports in such activities.
8212,1993-94,This would provide 100 per cent.
8213,1993-94,"Last year, I had proposed the setting up of a National Court of Direct Taxes for expeditious settlement of litigation in direct tax matters."
8214,1993-94,The proposal has been examined in detail and I hope soon to bring forward legislation in this regard.
8215,1993-94,"In regard to a Direct Taxes Code, the Government will take a final view, taking into account the recommendations of the Chelliah Committee on the subject."
8216,1993-94,The Wealthtax Act was considerably recast last year and the basis of taxation was shifted from wealth to unproductive assets.
8217,1993-94,There has been persistent demand that a residential dwelling is a universal necessity and should not be subjected to wealthtax.
8218,1993-94,"Hence, I propose to exempt the value of one residential house or part thereof from the levy of wealthtax."
8219,1993-94,"Last year, I had exempted residential houses, motor cars, etc. held as stockin trade from the levy of wealthtax."
8220,1993-94,I now propose to exempt urban land held as stockintrade.
8221,1993-94,"However, to discourage speculation in the guise of stockholding, I propose to restrict the exemption to three years beginning from the year in which the land is acquired."
8222,1993-94,"The exemption limit for purposes of gifttax was fixed at Rs 20,000 some years ago."
8223,1993-94,"I agree with the recommendations of the Tax Reforms Committee that this limit needs to be revised and, therefore, propose to raise it to Rs 30,000."
8224,1993-94,"Gifts made by a person to any dependant relative in respect of marriage of the relative is exempt from gifttax only up to Rs 10,000, whereas vast expenditures on ostentatious marriages go scotfree."
8225,1993-94,"In order to encourage savings and productive investment, I propose to raise the exemption limit at the time of the marriage of a dependant relative from Rs 10,000 to Rs  30,000."
8226,1993-94,"As an incentive to the export drive which has to be kept up at all costs, I propose to exempt all banking companies from the levy of Interesttax on export credit provided by them."
8227,1993-94,The various changes that I have proposed would result in a loss of Rs 300 crore of which the States’ share would be Rs  194 crore.
8228,1993-94,The amount involved is very small – less than 2 per cent of the gross direct tax collections.
8229,1993-94,I am ignoring it in the expectation that better tax collection would cover this loss.
8230,1993-94,I now turn to the proposals relating to indirect taxes.
8231,1993-94,"Since 1973, we have been levying a separate auxiliary duty in addition to the basic customs duty."
8232,1993-94,"In order to simplify the tariff structure and the assessment process, I propose to do away with the separate auxiliary duty and merge it with the basic duty."
8233,1993-94,Our first priority in restructuring customs duty should be in the area of capital goods and project imports since these duties affect the incentives for new investment.
8234,1993-94,Last year the duty on projects and general machinery was brought down from 80% to 55%.
8235,1993-94,This is still too high compared with rates in competitor countries and a further reduction is necessary.
8236,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to lower the import duty on projects and general machinery to 35%."
8237,1993-94,"Projects in certain priority sectors such as, power, coal mining and petroleum refining currently attract a duty rate of 30%."
8238,1993-94,I propose to reduce the rate to 25% in the case of coal mining and petroleum refining.
8239,1993-94,"In view of the special importance of the power sector, the duty on power projects is being reduced to 20% and this rate is also being extended to machinery required for modernisation and renovation of power plants."
8240,1993-94,"The House can rest assured that in restructuring duties on capital goods, I have made every effort to protect the legitimate interests of domestic capital goods industry."
8241,1993-94,We have had extensive discussions with various Ministries as well as representatives of concerned industries.
8242,1993-94,"In order to ensure that lower duties on 16 imported machinery do not hurt the domestic capital goods industry, it is necessary to lower the import duty on components, to enable our manufacturers to compete effectively."
8243,1993-94,"I therefore, propose to reduce to 25% the duty on components of general machinery which presently is either 40% or 35%."
8244,1993-94,"In order, however, to ensure that domestic industries producing such components are not adversely affected, I propose to impose countervailing duty on such components at 10% with full facility of set off under MODVAT."
8245,1993-94,"At present there are a number of other capital goods, including various types of machine tools, which attract different rates of duty in the range of 60% to 110%."
8246,1993-94,There are also instruments which attract duties varying from 40% to 110%.
8247,1993-94,"I propose to rationalise this structure into three duty rate slots, viz., 40%, 60% and 80%."
8248,1993-94,The rationalisation involves generally a duty reduction between 20 to 30 percentage points.
8249,1993-94,Consequential reduction is being made in the rates of duty on specified parts and components.
8250,1993-94,Handoperated tools are capital goods for artisans and skilled workers and currently attract duties varying from 40% to 110%.
8251,1993-94,I propose to prescribe a uniform rate of 40% for all these tools.
8252,1993-94,"The logic of reducing duties on capital goods requires lowering of duties on metals and metal goods as well, as these are the basic raw materials of the domestic capital goods industry."
8253,1993-94,"Accordingly, to help domestic producers, I propose to lower the customs duty rates on ferrous metals by 10 to 20 percentage points in most cases."
8254,1993-94,In line with these changes the import duty on steel scrap is being re fixed at 15%.
8255,1993-94,The import duty on specified refractory raw materials is being reduced to 30%.
8256,1993-94,"Turning to nonferrous metals, I propose to reduce the duty rates by 10 to 55 percentage points in most cases."
8257,1993-94,The resulting rates on unwrought and unalloyed forms will vary from 25% to 50% and on wrought forms from 70% to 80%.
8258,1993-94,The duty structure for chemicals is characterised by a multiplicity of rates and many irrationalities.
8259,1993-94,Input duties are often out of line with duties on finished products.
8260,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to restructure the duty rates on chemicals with a view to significantly lowering duty rates at the upper end and also ensuring that the duty rates on inputs are not generally higher than the duty on end products."
8261,1993-94,"The present duty rates on basic feed stocks such as, ethylene, propylene, butadiene, benzene, styrene and ethylene dichloride vary between 25% and 80%."
8262,1993-94,These rates are being replaced by a uniform low duty rate of 15%.
8263,1993-94,"The duties on xylenes, paraxylene, toluene, acrylonitrile and cumene are being reduced to 40%."
8264,1993-94,"The duties on DMT, PTA and MEG which represent a higher stage of production, are being reduced and unified at 70%."
8265,1993-94,"In the case of caprolactum, however, the duty is being increased from 50% to 60%, in order to adequately protect the interests of the domestic units."
8266,1993-94,The electronics industry has the potential of becoming a world class industry contributing to our export effort and to employment generation.
8267,1993-94,I propose to take up this challenge.
8268,1993-94,The rates of duty on project imports and on specified capital goods for electronics attract duty at either 30% or 50% at present.
8269,1993-94,I propose to reduce these rates to a uniform rate of 25%.
8270,1993-94,"The import duties on raw materials, pieceparts and components at present are levied at 40%, 60% and 80%."
8271,1993-94,"These rates are being reduced to 20%, 35% and 50%, respectively."
8272,1993-94,The import duty on specified raw materials for the manufacture of optical fibre cables is being drastically 17 reduced from 90% to 20% in recognition of the urgency of extending and modernising the telecom sector.
8273,1993-94,"In order to strengthen our export capability in existing exportthrust areas such as textiles, leather, marine products, gems and jewelry, etc. where we have a comparative advantage, I propose to reduce the import duty on specified capital goods for these sectors from 40% to 25%."
8274,1993-94,"In addition, certain recommendations have been made by the Groups on Extreme Focus items for export for augmenting the export potential of certain sectors such as food processing, horticulture and floricultural industries."
8275,1993-94,"Accordingly, the import duty on specified items for these sectors is being reduced to 25%."
8276,1993-94,The shipbreaking industry is employment intensive and an important source of raw materials for the secondary sector of our steel industry.
8277,1993-94,"In order to encourage the growth of this industry, I propose to prescribe a lower merged duty of customs at 5% ad valorem."
8278,1993-94,The ferrous materials obtained from breaking up of such ships etc. which are presently subject to excise duty are being fully exempted.
8279,1993-94,Our film industry is one of the largest in the world in terms of the footage of films produced.
8280,1993-94,"Although it has achieved this status without much need for incentives, it is now facing greater competition from the electronic media, and deserves some special encouragement."
8281,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the duties on jumbo rolls of cine positive films from 55% to 25% and on finished cine film rolls from about 65% to 40%."
8282,1993-94,I also propose to reduce the duty on negative cine films from about 35% to 25%.
8283,1993-94,"In order to encourage the development of nonconventional energy sources, especially solar energy, the import duty on specified raw materials and items of this industry is being reduced by 15 to 20 percentage points."
8284,1993-94,In respect of wind operated electricity generators I propose to reduce the import duty from 40% to 25%. 94.
8285,1993-94,"As a gesture of goodwill towards Bangladesh, I propose to fully exempt the famous Jamdanee saris from payment of import duties."
8286,1993-94,"Smallscale units, eligible for excise duty exemption for clearances to domestic area are at present required to pay excise duty on goods exported by them to Nepal and Bhutan."
8287,1993-94,I propose to exempt these from this levy.
8288,1993-94,I hope these steps will make a contribution towards improving trade with SAARC countries.
8289,1993-94,"At present, accredited press cameramen have the facility of importing photographic equipment free of duty upto a limit of Rs 60,000 but no such facility is available to other journalists to import specialised equipment such as, laptop computers, personal computers, fax machines and typewriters."
8290,1993-94,I have often wondered whether this explains why my photographs in the Press are better than the editorial comments!
8291,1993-94,"As a measure of my commitment to encourage modern technology in Indian journalism, and in recognition of the sterling role played by our Pressmen in creating a wider appreciation of issues of economic reform in the country, I propose to allow accredited journalists also a one time facility to import such equipment duty free upto a value of Rs 60,000."
8292,1993-94,The duty rate on certain specified items of baggage was recently reduced from 255% to 150%.
8293,1993-94,"As a measure of simplification, I propose to reduce the general baggage rate itself from 255% to 150%."
8294,1993-94,"In line with these reductions in import duties for individual sectors, and keeping in mind the present exchange rate, there is scope for reduction in the maximum rate of duty on all goods."
8295,1993-94,Accordingly I propose to reduce the maximum rate from 110% to 85% except for a few items including passenger baggage and alcoholic beverages.
8296,1993-94,I am aware that Honourable Members will be concerned that lowering of import duties and import liberalisation may put too much pressure on our industry and make it vulnerable to unfair competition and dumping.
8297,1993-94,I would like to assure Honourable Members that these issues have been carefully considered and the proposed changes will not put undue pressure on industry.
8298,1993-94,The change in the exchange rate over the past two years has created considerable room for duty reduction without hurting domestic industry.
8299,1993-94,"Besides, I am also reducing duties on raw materials and inputs which will help to reduce cost for our producers, enabling them to compete more effectively."
8300,1993-94,"Even with these changes, duties on finished products will be well above the long term structure recommended by the Chelliah Committee."
8301,1993-94,We can move to that goal in phases over the next few years.
8302,1993-94,"As for unfair competition through dumping, our antidumping laws are already operational and action under these laws will be taken expeditiously whenever it is needed."
8303,1993-94,I may mention that provisional action has recently been taken in one case.
8304,1993-94,In last year ’s Budget export duties had been imposed on iron ore and unpolished granite.
8305,1993-94,Certain difficulties faced by these sectors have since been brought to my notice.
8306,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw the export duty on iron ore and unpolished granite. 100.I turn now to my proposals relating to excise duties."
8307,1993-94,"These are guided by the need to simplify the rate structure, to give some relief on articles of mass consumption, help the domestic capital goods industry so as to increase its competitiveness and also reduce capital costs, assist industries suffering .c.from depressed demand conditions, and to provide relief to smallscale industry."
8308,1993-94,"As a measure of simplification, I propose to merge the special excise duty with the basic excise duty rates while also rationalising the resulting duty rates."
8309,1993-94,"Coffee, tea and instant tea are being fully exempted from excise duty."
8310,1993-94,I also propose to reduce excise duty on vanaspati from Rs 1900 to Rs 1500 per metric ton.
8311,1993-94,"I propose to fully exempt footwear made by units under KVIC as well as those run with cash assistance received under the Integrated Rural Development Programme, irrespective of the value limit."
8312,1993-94,"In respect of footwear manufactured by other units, I propose to enhance the present value limit for the purpose of exemption from Rs 75 to Rs 125 per pair."
8313,1993-94,I also propose to reduce the excise duty:  on evaporative coolers from 23% to 10%;  on electric fans from 17.25% to 10%;  on specified domestic electrical appliances from 23% to 15%; 19  on dry cell batteries from 34.5% to 25%;  on printing and writing ink from 17.25% to 10%;  on radio sets from 23% to 10%;  on tooth powder from 17.25% to 10%;  on noodles and roasted cereals from 17.25% to 10%;  on biscuits from 11.5% to 7.5%;  on plastic moulded luggage from 34.5% to 25%;  on mattresses and bedding articles of cellular rubber from 69% to 30%.
8314,1993-94,"In order to lower capital costs and stimulate investment, I propose to reduce the excise duty on a large number of capital goods and instruments to a uniform rate of 10%."
8315,1993-94,"For the power sector, I am proposing an even lower rate of 5%."
8316,1993-94,"Sectors such as the automotive sector, television and the refrigeration and air conditioning industries are currently suffering from recession."
8317,1993-94,Workers employed in these industries face an uncertain future.
8318,1993-94,Revenue prospects will also suffer if the present trend is not reversed.
8319,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to provide a significant relief to these industries by way of reduced incidence of excise duties."
8320,1993-94,I expect them to respond positively to this stimulus.
8321,1993-94,"In order to encourage the public transport sector, I propose to reduce excise duty from 23% to 15% on nonpetrol driven commercial vehicles for carrying goods and passengers."
8322,1993-94,"Correspondingly, the excise duty on the chassis of such vehicles will also stand reduced to 15%."
8323,1993-94,I also propose to fully exempt excise duty on body building on chassis of buses and similar passenger vehicles.
8324,1993-94,The excise duty on threewheelers is being reduced from 23% to 15%.
8325,1993-94,I also propose to reduce the excise duty on motor cars from 55% to 40%.
8326,1993-94,I propose to reduce the rates to Rs 400 to Rs 3500 per refrigerator.
8327,1993-94,"Other refrigerating appliances, including those used for cold storage in the agriculture sector currently attract an ad valorem duty of 69%."
8328,1993-94,This is far too high as it affects the growth of food processing and preservation industries.
8329,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the duty to 20%."
8330,1993-94,I propose to reduce excise duty on airconditioners from rates varying from Rs 13800 to Rs 85100 per unit at present to rates varying from Rs 7000 to Rs 70000 per unit depending on its capacity.
8331,1993-94,"In respect of compressors for airconditioner of capacity not exceeding 7.5 tonnes, I propose to reduce the excise duty from Rs 6900 to Rs 5500 per compressor."
8332,1993-94,This measure will benefit smallscale units manufacturing plastic products.
8333,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to rationalise the existing duty structure on metals."
8334,1993-94,"On ferrous metals, the ad valorem rates generally vary between 11.5% and 23%."
8335,1993-94,"I propose to rationalise the structure into two slabs, 12.5% and 15%."
8336,1993-94,Aluminium has duty rates ranging from 23% to 40.25%.
8337,1993-94,I propose to replace these rates by a uniform rate of 25%.
8338,1993-94,"Other non ferrous metals like copper, zinc, lead etc. attract duty rates varying from 11.5% to 34.5%."
8339,1993-94,I am proposing a uniform duty of 15% for these.
8340,1993-94,Certain ferrous materials are still subjected to specific rates of duty.
8341,1993-94,I have proposed some upward adjustment in these rates taking into account the price increase since last year.
8342,1993-94,"I also propose to include pulp made from rice and wheat straws in the scheme of full excise duty exemption for production of writing and printing paper and uncoated craft paper containing not less than 75% of pulp made from bagasse, jute, etc."
8343,1993-94,This will widen the scope for using nonconventional raw materials in the manufacture of paper.
8344,1993-94,The Government of Tamil Nadu has brought to my notice certain difficulties faced by this industry and also certain anomalies in the structure.
8345,1993-94,"Accepting this suggestion, I propose to reduce the rates to Rs 2.40, Rs 1.25, Re.1.00 and Re.0.50 respectively and also to restrict the existing concessions in the cottage sector only to units which are registered co operative societies or recognised by KVIC or the State KVIB."
8346,1993-94,These items are now being increasingly used by a wide section of the people for personal care.
8347,1993-94,"I have received several representations from the trade, consumers and women’s organisations for reduction of excise duty."
8348,1993-94,I have also received complaints regarding the growth of spurious products and other abuses related to the evasion of this very high duty.
8349,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the excise duty on cosmetics and toilet preparations from 120.75% to 70%."
8350,1993-94,The central excise duty exemption scheme for this sector has contributed significantly to its development along with other measures taken by the Central and State Governments.
8351,1993-94,I propose to simplify the scheme and restructure it to give additional incentives to the smaller units and at the same time respond to certain recommendations of the Estimates Committee and the Public Accounts Committee.
8352,1993-94,"This will free a large number of the smaller units from the necessity of registration, and at the same time enable the tax authorities to devote greater attention to the comparatively larger units."
8353,1993-94,"At present, excise duty is completely exempted from the first Rs 20 lakh of turnover for units producing goods under one chapter of the excise tariff, and the limit is Rs 30 lakh if the goods produced are under more than one chapter of the tariff."
8354,1993-94,I propose to enhance the duty exemption limit to Rs 30 lakh for all units.
8355,1993-94,This should benefit a large number of units in the lower segment of the smallscale sector.
8356,1993-94,"At present, the excise duty payable above the zero duty limit and upto Rs 75 lakh is normal duty minus 10 percentage points, subject to a minimum of 5% ad valorem."
8357,1993-94,I propose to retain this for clearances upto Rs 50 lakh in a financial year.
8358,1993-94,"For clearances beyond Rs 50 lakh and upto Rs 75 lakh, the concessional rate will be normal duty minus 5 percentage points, subject to a minimum of 5% ad valorem."
8359,1993-94,The Public Accounts Committee has found certain irregularities in the operation of this facility.
8360,1993-94,"The Tax Reforms Committee has also not favoured continuance of this special dispensation, which essentially helps the largescale user industry."
8361,1993-94,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw the higher notional credit which the buyers of goods produced by the smallscale units are getting at present."
8362,1993-94,They will receive MODVAT credit only on the basis of duty actually paid.
8363,1993-94,I propose to extend full exemption in respect of clearances from Rs 5 lakh at present to Rs 15 lakh.
8364,1993-94,"Thereafter, clearances upto Rs 30 lakh in a financial year would attract 50% of the normal duty."
8365,1993-94,Clearances above Rs 30 lakh in a financial year will attract normal duty.
8366,1993-94,The liberalised scheme of exemption will be available only to those units whose value of clearances does not exceed Rs 50 lakh in a financial year.
8367,1993-94,"I propose to reduce the import duty on various items of machinery used for agriculture, horticulture, forestry, poultry keeping, etc. from 55% to 25%."
8368,1993-94,I propose to reduce the import duty on rice transplanters from 40% to 15%.
8369,1993-94,I also propose to reduce the import duty on grand parent poultry stocks from 105% to 40%.
8370,1993-94,The import duty on certain amino acids is proposed to be reduced from 65% to 15%.
8371,1993-94,The import duty on certain pesticide intermediates is being reduced from rates ranging between 65% and 110% to 50%.
8372,1993-94,I propose to reduce the excise duty on them to 10% and 15% respectively.
8373,1993-94,"Next to agriculture, it is the largest employer in the country."
8374,1993-94,The present excise duty rates on polyester and nylon filament yarn are higher as compared to other types of yarn.
8375,1993-94,Substantial capacities have been set up in the synthetic sector of fibre and yarn.
8376,1993-94,"As part of a longterm policy of bringing synthetic fabrics within the reach of the common man, I feel there is a need to reduce the excise duty rates in this sector."
8377,1993-94,"Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty on polyester filament yarn from Rs 80.60 to Rs 69 per kg."
8378,1993-94,I also propose to reduce excise duty on polyester staple fibre from Rs 13.65 to Rs 12.65 per kg.
8379,1993-94,"On polypropylene filament yarn, I propose to reduce the excise duty from Rs 32.50 to Rs 28.75 per kg."
8380,1993-94,I further propose to reduce excise duty on acrylic staple fibre from Rs 15.60 to Rs 14.95 per kg.
8381,1993-94,I propose to reduce import duty on specified bulk drugs at 110% or 80% to 25%.
8382,1993-94,I also propose to fix a uniform rate of 50% on specified drug intermediates which currently attract import duties varying from 60% to 110%.
8383,1993-94,"In respect of homoeopathic medicines, I propose to reduce import duty from 40% to 25%."
8384,1993-94,"At present, full exemption from import duty is available to certain parts of specified life saving electronic medical equipments."
8385,1993-94,"To help in accelerating the indigenisation process, I propose to extend full exemption to such parts for the manufacture of specified nonelectronic lifesaving medical equipments also."
8386,1993-94,"In respect of components for the manufacture of certain other medical equipments, I propose to reduce import duty from 45% and 25% at present to 15%."
8387,1993-94,"Further, for the same reason, I propose to fully exempt specified sightsaving equipments from excise duty and to lower excise duty on some medical equipments to 10%."
8388,1993-94,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
8389,1993-94,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
8390,1993-94,"However, I expect that as a result of the many steps that the Government is taking, including the duty reductions, the production of excisable goods will go up, and the 23 loss will therefore be partially offset by a gain of about Rs 1000 crore on this account."
8391,1993-94,Out of the net loss of revenue in excise duties the Centre’s share will be Rs 708 crore and that of States Rs 541 crore.
8392,1993-94,This revenue loss will be entirely borne by the Centre.
8393,1993-94,The impact on the Centre’s revenue is a loss of Rs 3981 crore and that on States’ is Rs 541 crore.
8394,1993-94,I believe this is a temporary loss and is necessary to impart a new dynamism to India’s economy.
8395,1993-94,"In the medium term, this loss will be more than made up by increased efficiency, competitiveness and faster growth of the economy."
8396,1993-94,"Speaker, Sir, the world around us is changing very rapidly, becoming more integrated as a marketplace and also more competitive."
8397,1993-94,Other developing countries are successfully transforming themselves to meet these challenges.
8398,1993-94,"We cannot afford to stay out of this process, appearing to be absorbed with obscurantist preoccupations and sectarian divisions."
8399,1993-94,"The solution lies precisely in harnessing the considerable energies of our people, especially the young, to the exciting task of economic rejuvenation."
8400,1993-94,I have used this Budget as an opportunity to put economic and social development firmly back on the national agenda.
8401,1993-94,This is the only way to show the world that India is a nation on the move and is determined to succeed.
8402,1993-94,For that we need a vibrant and rapidly expanding economy with deep and abiding concern for the poor and the underprivileged.
8403,1993-94,Politics has to be a purposeful instrument for realising our cherished goals.
8404,1993-94,There is no scope for confrontation or cold war tactics when it comes to dealing with the nation’s social and economic objectives.
8405,1993-94,"We need wisdom, sobriety, firmness of purpose and above all national unity."
8406,1993-94,Swami Vivekananda used to say there is an element of divinity in each human being.
8407,1993-94,We have to create an environment in which this divine potentiality can be mobilised for building a strong economy and a just society.
8408,1993-94,This is the challenge that our political system must face squarely.
8409,1993-94,I venture to think that this budget focusses the nation’s attention on this imperative task.
8410,1994-95,"It is with a sense of great privilege, and also deep humility, that I rise to present the Budget for 199495."
8411,1994-95,"Less than three years have passed since our Party, under the inspiring leadership of Prime Minister Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, came into office, as a minority Government at that time, facing the awesome task of rebuilding a shattered economy."
8412,1994-95,The Prime Minister had pledged that we would give top priority to grappling with the grave economic crisis and put the economy back on a path of strong sustainable growth.
8413,1994-95,In pursuit of this mandate we embarked on a far reaching programme of economic restructuring and reform.
8414,1994-95,"Three years are not enough to complete economic restructuring in a country as complex as India, but it is time enough to take stock."
8415,1994-95,I am sure all Honourable Members will agree that the economic situation has shown substantial improvement.
8416,1994-95,Progress on the external front has been dramatic.
8417,1994-95,"Our foreign currency reserves, which were a little over $1 billion in June, 1991 are now close to $ 13 billion."
8418,1994-95,"Our gold, which earlier had been pledged abroad, is back in our possession. ·"
8419,1994-95,Exporters are responding very well to our sweeping reforms of exchange rate and trade policies.
8420,1994-95,Our exports have increased by a remarkable 21 per cent in dollar terms in the first 10 months of 199394.
8421,1994-95,"This compares, for the corresponding period, with a decline of 3 per cent in 199192 and a rise of 2 per cent in 199293."
8422,1994-95,"For the fiscal year 199394, imports are likely to be lower than even 199091."
8423,1994-95,The current account deficit in our balance of payments during 199394 will be less than half a per cent of GDP compared to over 3 per cent in 199091 and 2 per cent in 199293.
8424,1994-95,"Contrary to what many feared, the exchange rate for the rupee has remained remarkably steady despite unification and lifting of trade controls."
8425,1994-95,Foreign exchange is flowing through legal channels in ample quantities instead of through hawala transactions as earlier.
8426,1994-95,International confidence in India has been restored.
8427,1994-95,"Foreign direct and portfolio investment, which was hardly $150 million in 199192, is likely to be around $3 billion in 199394."
8428,1994-95,The news on the domestic economy is also encouraging.
8429,1994-95,Inflation has been reduced from the peak of 17 per cent in August 1991 to about half that level at present.
8430,1994-95,Agricultural performance has been strong.
8431,1994-95,"Food stocks in the public system stood at over 23 million tonnes on 1st January, 1994."
8432,1994-95,This is the highest level in seven years and provides invaluable insurance against any possible crop failure.
8433,1994-95,"Industrial growth is also recovering, though more slowly than we had hoped."
8434,1994-95,Overall economic growth is estimated at about 4 per cent for the second year in a row.
8435,1994-95,Fears that the reform programme might lead to a large scale increase in unemployment have turned out to be unfounded.
8436,1994-95,The latest available data of persons registered with employment exchanges and seeking jobs show a fall of 1.4 per cent in November 1993 as compared to November 1992.
8437,1994-95,The slow growth of industry in 199394 is a matter of concern and is largely due to the sluggishness of the capital goods sector.
8438,1994-95,"If capital goods are excluded, the rest of the manufacturing sector shows 6 per cent growth in the second quarter and is expected to improve in the rest of the year."
8439,1994-95,The recession in the capital goods industries is primarily because investment activity slowed down temporarily as firms adjusted their investment plans to the new situation.
8440,1994-95,There are signs that this restructuring process is well advanced and many companies are now launching major programmes to enhance their international competitiveness.
8441,1994-95,"The turnaround in investment is, therefore, beginning."
8442,1994-95,In real life the picture is never entirely rosy and there are some warning signals which we must heed.
8443,1994-95,It has not been possible to contain the fiscal deficit in the current year to the level we had originally targeted.
8444,1994-95,The slower pace of industrial recovery in 199394 led to a shortfall in revenues and various expenditures have also exceeded Budget estimates.
8445,1994-95,"The slippage in the fiscal deficit in 199394 has been less damaging than might have been the case ordinarily, mainly because of the existence of sizeable idle industrial capacity and low investment levels."
8446,1994-95,"But as investment begins to revive, we cannot afford continuing weakness on the fiscal front."
8447,1994-95,"Unless the deterioration witnessed in the current year is speedily reversed, there is a serious danger that we may slip back into a position where large government deficits fuel inflation, widen the current account imbalance and push up interest rates, making it impossible to bring about the rapid economic growth we need to raise living standards and create productive jobs in adequate numbers."
8448,1994-95,"In formulating this Budget, I have sought to address six major tasks:  "
8449,1994-95,"First, we must accelerate the reform and modernisation of our tax system we began two years ago."
8450,1994-95,"Third, we must build on the demonstrable success already achieved in the external sector where our strong performance has vindicated our strategy of phased integration with the world economy.  "
8451,1994-95,"Fourth, the Budget must provide a major stimulus for a strong industrial recovery, especially for investment and capital goods production.  "
8452,1994-95,"Fifth, and most importantly, we must reorient our development policies and programmes to address more effectively the problems of poverty, unemployment and social deprivation which affect a large mass of our people, particularly in rural areas.  "
8453,1994-95,"Sixth, we have to consolidate and deepen the progress we have made in restoring the health of our banking system."
8454,1994-95,"Last year we moved to a unified, marketdetermined exchange rate system."
8455,1994-95,The system has worked extremely well.
8456,1994-95,The time has come to take the next step and move towards convertibility on the current account.
8457,1994-95,"Current account convertibility will substantially liberalise the access to foreign exchange for all current business transactions and also liberalise foreign exchange access for travel, education and medical expenses, etc."
8458,1994-95,This will virtually eliminate reliance upon illegal channels for such transactions.
8459,1994-95,The details of these liberalisations are being separately announced by the Reserve Bank.
8460,1994-95,"Consistent with the progressive liberalisation of our external payments regime, we shall review the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, and undertake necessary changes, including, if necessary, its replacement by new legislation."
8461,1994-95,Our policies towards foreign direct and portfolio investment have yielded good results and have helped us reduce our reliance on foreign borrowing.
8462,1994-95,Much of the direct investment approved has been for critical infrastructure sectors.
8463,1994-95,"As envisaged in my Budget speech last year, Government is currently negotiating bilateral investment treaties with several major investor countries."
8464,1994-95,"Our external debt, which is a cause of concern, is growing more slowly now."
8465,1994-95,It grew by about $6 billion per year on an average in the latter half of the 1980s.
8466,1994-95,In 199091 the debt grew by over $8 billion.
8467,1994-95,"In 199192 and 199293, the increase averaged only about $3 billion."
8468,1994-95,"In the first half of 199394, external debt has increased by hardly $300 million."
8469,1994-95,"Furthermore, the recent increase in debt has been more than offset by the sharp increase in our foreign currency reserves."
8470,1994-95,I would like to assure the House that we shall remain vigilant on this front so that external debt remains within prudent levels.
8471,1994-95,There is no question of India falling into a debt trap.
8472,1994-95,"In fact, we propose to respond to the easier payments position by retiring some of the high cost debt we have incurred in the past."
8473,1994-95,Indian companies will be freely permitted to prepay past foreign loans.
8474,1994-95,Honourable Members are aware that some of our external debt is owed to the IMF.
8475,1994-95,We had approached the Fund in our hour of difficulty.
8476,1994-95,"Now that our payments situation has improved considerably and our reserves have been rebuilt to comfortable levels, we are in a position to repay the Fund somewhat ahead of schedule."
8477,1994-95,Repayments of principal and interest amounting to $1.4 billion are due to the Fund in 199495.
8478,1994-95,"Instead of following the regular schedule of payments, we 4 intend to prepay the entire amount at the beginning of the year."
8479,1994-95,This decision to prepay in no sense detracts from the excellent relations we have with the Fund which has helped us immensely in our time of need.
8480,1994-95,"We will not hesitate to seek financial support again, if conditions warrant."
8481,1994-95,"At present exporters and other foreign exchange earners, are permitted to retain up to 15 per cent of foreign exchange receipts in an account designated in foreign currency."
8482,1994-95,It has been decided to increase the percentage of retention allowed from 15 to 25 per cent.
8483,1994-95,"As a special incentive, for 100% Export Oriented Units and units in Export Processing Zones as well as units in Electronic Hardware Technology Parks and Software Technology Parks, the retention allowed will be 50 per cent."
8484,1994-95,This facility is designed to protect exporters from having to incur conversion costs when they make payments for imports.
8485,1994-95,The necessary notifications are being separately issued by the Reserve Bank of India.
8486,1994-95,"Turning to the need to strengthen fiscal discipline, I have long felt that Government should not be able to finance its deficits by creating money, through unlimited recourse to the Reserve Bank, by issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills."
8487,1994-95,This practice has also weakened the Reserve Bank’s capacity to conduct effective monetary policy.
8488,1994-95,"As a corrective measure, I propose to phase out the Government’s access to ad hoc Treasury Bills over a period of three years."
8489,1994-95,"In 199495 the budget deficit is being limited to about twothirds of one per cent of expected GDP, or Rs 6,000 crore."
8490,1994-95,"Normally, net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills for the year as a whole should not exceed this amount."
8491,1994-95,"It has also been agreed with the Reserve Bank that the net issue of ad hoc Treasury Bills should not exceed Rs 9,000 crore for more than ten continuous working days at any time during the year."
8492,1994-95,"If this happens, the Reserve Bank will automatically sell Treasury Bills in the market to reduce the level of ad hoc Treasury Bills."
8493,1994-95,"This is a historic step which will in due course contribute to a significant improvement in fiscal and monetary discipline, and give the Reserve Bank greater scope for effective monetary management."
8494,1994-95,"In subsequent years, the recourse to ad hoc Treasury Bills will be progressively reduced and by 199798, the Government will cease to have direct recourse to the Reserve Bank for financing its deficit and will have to meet its entire requirements through borrowing from the market."
8495,1994-95,Interest rates have an important influence on investment in industry and other sectors of the economy.
8496,1994-95,There have been repeated demands that interest rates should be brought down.
8497,1994-95,The minimum lending rates charged by banks have been brought down already by three percentage points over the past year.
8498,1994-95,The Financial Institutions have also reduced their effective rates.
8499,1994-95,I am happy to inform the House that the AllIndia Financial Institutions are now reducing their minimum lending rate by a further one percentage point to 14 per cent exclusive of interest tax.
8500,1994-95,"Simultaneously, the commercial banks’ minimum lending rate on term loans of three years and above is also being reduced from 15 per cent to 14 per cent."
8501,1994-95,The Reserve Bank is separately issuing the notification.
8502,1994-95,These changes take effect from tomorrow and will help to stimulate investment in the economy.
8503,1994-95,Government had earlier proposed certain amendments to the Companies Act to streamline the Act in line with the contemporary requirements.
8504,1994-95,Several representations have been received from industry seeking modifications of these proposals to give Indian companies an environment in which they can compete 5 effectively in the highly competitive market place.
8505,1994-95,Government has reconsidered the matter in the light of these representations and it is proposed to submit a new Bill to Parliament which will be responsive to these concerns.
8506,1994-95,We live in a world where science and technology have become a major determinant of the power and wealth of nations.
8507,1994-95,"India is proud of the achievements of its scientists and technologists, but a great deal more needs to be done to make science and technology an effective instrument of national renewal."
8508,1994-95,"To accelerate the development and application of indigenous technology to production processes, I propose to credit the 5 per cent cess on payments of royalty for imported technologies which is presently collected under the Research and Development Cess Act, 1986, into a new Fund for Technology Development and Application."
8509,1994-95,This Fund will be placed at the disposal of the Department of Science and Technology to help the indigenously developed technologies reach the stage of commercial application.
8510,1994-95,Necessary amendments to this effect will be made in the R & D Cess Act.
8511,1994-95,I shall propose some further measures to promote research and development when I come to my tax proposals.
8512,1994-95,I would like to assure the House that our policies are geared towards promoting a dynamic and internationally competitive industrial sector.
8513,1994-95,"I am confident that given our vast reservoir of skilled manpower and entrepreneurship, Indian industry has the capacity and the will to meet the challenge of global competition."
8514,1994-95,Government and industry will work as active partners to usher in the second industrial revolution which is both more efficient and more employmentoriented.
8515,1994-95,"This year, my revenue proposals, to which I will come later, include a strong package of measures to boost industrial investment and capital goods production."
8516,1994-95,"Looking ahead, I have a vision of our industrial firms acquiring a global reach and their names becoming household words in far off, distant lands."
8517,1994-95,Let me now turn to some issues relating to agriculture.
8518,1994-95,An adequate flow of institutional rural credit to agriculture is vital for the development of the rural sector and this flow at present is unduly low in relation to need.
8519,1994-95,"The reasons include high costs of intermediation incurred by banks and cooperatives, fundamental weaknesses in the institutional structure and unsustainable restrictions on credit and interest rate policy."
8520,1994-95,I propose to take a number of significant steps to lay the basis for a longterm improvement in rural credit.
8521,1994-95,The National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD is the apex agency for rural credit.
8522,1994-95,I am providing Rs 100 crore for augmenting its share capital and the Reserve Bank will contribute an equivalent amount.
8523,1994-95,This will nearly triple NABARD’s share capital and equip it to play a strong leadership role in strengthening the system of rural credit.
8524,1994-95,One of our major concerns in rural credit has been the weak condition of the Regional Rural Banks RRBs.
8525,1994-95,"Of the 196 regional rural banks, as many as 150 have shown losses in each of the past five years."
8526,1994-95,Many have completely wiped out their equity and reserves and in some the losses are eating into deposits.
8527,1994-95,This is an unsustainable situation and longterm structural measures are necessary if these banks are to be rehabilitated.
8528,1994-95,The Reserve Bank has already announced some measures giving RRBs greater flexibility in their lending operations to make them more viable.
8529,1994-95,"I propose to take up 50 of the 196 RRBs from all over the country in the course of 199495 for undertaking comprehensive restructuring, including cleaning up of their balance sheets and infusion of fresh capital."
8530,1994-95,The form and modality of the restructuring and associated financial support will be worked out 6 during the year.
8531,1994-95,The experience with these 50 RRBs will guide our approach in later years to the other RRBs.
8532,1994-95,"The success of this programme will depend on full cooperation from State Governments and sponsor banks, who are shareholders, as well as the employees of RRBs."
8533,1994-95,Our objective is to transform presently weak and ailing RRBs into financially viable and effective instruments of decentralised rural banking.
8534,1994-95,"In addition, we must find ways of strengthening the cooperative credit structure which has played a significant role in rural development through credit support."
8535,1994-95,"As against Rs 6,295 crore of new lending by cooperatives during 1992 93, they are expected to reach Rs 8,500 crore during 199394."
8536,1994-95,"During 199495 we are planning for a further increase to Rs 9,600 crore."
8537,1994-95,This quantitative expansion must be accompanied by organisational and structural changes which ensure financial viability.
8538,1994-95,The Government proposes to initiate a series of measures for strengthening the cooperative structure.
8539,1994-95,NABARD will be entering into memoranda of understanding with State and District Cooperative Banks and concerned State Governments for implementing Statespecific development action plans to revamp the cooperative system and improve its viability.
8540,1994-95,These measures to strengthen the rural credit system are being accompanied by a substantial increase in the budget provision for Rural Development to which I will come shortly.
8541,1994-95,It will also be our objective to ensure that our policies towards agriculture eliminate all unnecessary restraints on farmers.
8542,1994-95,"Restrictions on domestic movement of foodgrains and other agricultural goods must be completely removed, so that our farmers can reap the benefits of an unified national market."
8543,1994-95,"They must also be increasingly free to export, thus not only making their due contribution to our national export effort, but also benefiting from profitable export opportunities."
8544,1994-95,"Honourable Members are aware, we have embarked on a basic restructuring of the banking system aimed at ensuring full financial viability of its operations and strengthening its competitive capability."
8545,1994-95,"I provided a sum of Rs 5,700 crore as capital contribution to the nationalised banks in 199394 to help them make necessary provisions against bad and doubtful loans and meet the new capital adequacy norms."
8546,1994-95,I had indicated last year that there would be additional capital needs in 199495 and 199596 and also that this burden could not be borne exclusively by the Budget.
8547,1994-95,"I am happy to report to the House that in December 1993 and January 1994, the State Bank of India successfully raised over Rs 2,200 crore from the public through issue of equity and another Rs 1,000 crore through a bond issue."
8548,1994-95,"To allow the nationalised banks to access capital markets in the same way, and mitigate the burden on the Budget, legislative amendments were introduced in the Lok Sabha in the Winter Session."
8549,1994-95,Their speedy passage will help many of these banks to mobilise the capital they need to meet their requirements.
8550,1994-95,"Many nationalised banks will nevertheless require additional support during 1994 95 and I am providing Rs 5,600 crore in 199495 as additional capital contribution for these banks."
8551,1994-95,"As before, this capital will be provided in the form of Government bonds on which there will be no immediate cash outgo."
8552,1994-95,Interest payments and amortisation will of course be a charge on future budgets.
8553,1994-95,"I am grateful to this House for quick passage last August of the Recovery of Debt due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 which provides for the establishment of Special Recovery Tribunals."
8554,1994-95,"These Tribunals will soon be 7 operational, and will play a major role in improving the recovery of banks’ dues."
8555,1994-95,I am also happy to report that the Reserve Bank is setting up the Board for Financial Supervision to supervise the banks and other financial institutions.
8556,1994-95,"To alert banks and financial institutions and put them on guard against borrowers who have defaulted in their dues to other lending institutions, the Reserve Bank of India is putting in place arrangements for circulating among banks and financial institutions names of the defaulting borrowers above a threshold limit."
8557,1994-95,The Reserve Bank will also publish a list of defaulting borrowers in cases where suits have been filed by banks and financial institutions.
8558,1994-95,Both these measures will encourage greater discipline among the borrowers.
8559,1994-95,The Government attaches high priority to reforms of the capital markets aimed at creating an efficient and competitive capital market subject to effective regulation by the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI which will ensure adequate investor protection.
8560,1994-95,"After a temporary setback in 1992 following the securities scam, the capital market recovered ground quickly."
8561,1994-95,"The funds mobilised in the capital market through public and rights issues, duly approved by SEBI, in the first ten months of 199394 were over Rs 18,000 crore, as compared to less than Rs 16,000 crore in the same period of 199293 and under Rs 6,000 crore for the full year, 199192."
8562,1994-95,"In addition, a number of Indian companies raised funds abroad through Euroequity issues and Foreign Currency Convertible Bond Issues."
8563,1994-95,The Government is committed to a thorough modernisation of the capital market and rapid improvement of trading practices with a view to ensuring transparency and speed of settlements.
8564,1994-95,The model National Stock Exchange with screenbased trading is expected to begin operation by the middle of this year.
8565,1994-95,The establishment of a Depository System of scripless trading is another important objective.
8566,1994-95,Government intends to bring before Parliament separate legislation for the establishment of Depositories.
8567,1994-95,The Government also proposes to make further amendments to the SEBI Act and the Securities Contracts Regulation Act in order to give additional powers to SEBI.
8568,1994-95,"In my Budget speech last year, I had announced the establishment of a HighPowered Committee to study the insurance industry and make recommendations on directions for its development in future."
8569,1994-95,"The Committee on Reforms in the Insurance Sector was appointed under the Chairmanship of Shri R.N. Malhotra, former Governor of the Reserve Bank of India."
8570,1994-95,"The Committee has recently submitted its report, which underscores the need for progressive deregulation of the insurance sector to create a more competitive and financially strong insurance industry, functioning under an independent regulatory authority."
8571,1994-95,The report is now under active consideration of the Government.
8572,1994-95,It is my intention to evolve a broad national consensus about the future direction and content of reform in this important sector.
8573,1994-95,Efficient and abundant infrastructure services are a necessary precondition for the success of our economic reforms and especially for international competitiveness.
8574,1994-95,"Our electric power sector is faced with severe problems, including problems of financial viability of the State Electricity Boards which must be solved if the supply of reliable power is to keep pace with everincreasing demand."
8575,1994-95,"The sector requires major changes in the working of State Electricity Boards, rationalisation of tariffs and restructuring of responsibilities for generation, 8 transmission and distribution."
8576,1994-95,A Committee of the National Development Council is looking into a comprehensive reform of our power system and it will be necessary to face up to a number of hard decisions in this sector.
8577,1994-95,"Significant steps have been taken in the oil and gas sector to promote investment including private investment in exploration, development, refining and marketing."
8578,1994-95,We propose to deepen and intensify these initiatives.
8579,1994-95,"To promote modernisation and investment in the coal industry, Government is reviewing the policy framework for investment, pricing and distribution."
8580,1994-95,New initiatives are under consideration in the Telecommunications Sector.
8581,1994-95,I shall now briefly go over the Revised Estimates for 199394.
8582,1994-95,"Budget estimates for 199394 had placed the total expenditure at Rs 131,323 crore."
8583,1994-95,"This is now expected to go up to Rs 143,872 crore, that is, an increase of Rs 12,549 crore."
8584,1994-95,"Budget estimates for the current year provided Rs 41,251 crore as budget support for Plan Expenditure."
8585,1994-95,"This is now being increased by Rs 4,775 crore to Rs 46,026 crore."
8586,1994-95,"Of this increase Rs 3,493 crore are for assistance to States for financing their plans."
8587,1994-95,A large part of this increase relates to externallyaided projects.
8588,1994-95,I have also provided Rs 856 crore as advance plan assistance to special category States to cover their opening deficits and Rs 339 crore as additional special plan loan to Punjab to help that State in the process of recovery.
8589,1994-95,"Under the Central Plan, a provision of Rs 600 crore has been made for the new Employment Assurance Scheme announced by the Prime Minister on 15th August, 1993."
8590,1994-95,"I have also augmented the current year’s provision for the National Renewal Fund by Rs 320 crore, taking the total to Rs 1,020 crore."
8591,1994-95,This increase will fund implementation of Voluntary Retirement Schemes in Public Sector Undertakings and also finance training and counselling.
8592,1994-95,"Nonplan expenditure in the current year will require an additional provision of Rs 7,774 crore."
8593,1994-95,"An additional Rs 2,200 crore has to be provided for food subsidy and Rs 900 crore for fertilizer subsidy."
8594,1994-95,I am including a provision of Rs 632 crore towards assistance to States for providing concession to farmers on decontrolled fertilizers.
8595,1994-95,"It has also become necessary to provide an additional Rs 2,320 crore for Defence expenditure."
8596,1994-95,Honourable Members will appreciate that there can be no question of compromise on the external and internal security of our country.
8597,1994-95,I am providing an additional Rs 303 crore more for Police.
8598,1994-95,"Other increases include Rs 219 crore for pensions and Rs 500 crore for loans to States as their share of small savings collections, following improved collections."
8599,1994-95,"Gross tax revenue, which was estimated in the Budget at Rs 84,867 crore, is now expected to yield Rs 8,117 crore less."
8600,1994-95,"Of this, about Rs 822 crore is due to tax receipts of the National Capital Territory of Delhi flowing into its own Consolidated Fund from 1st of December, 1993."
8601,1994-95,There is also a consequential reduction in expenditure on this account.
8602,1994-95,The rest of the shortfall is mainly under Customs and Union Excise Duties.
8603,1994-95,"Customs revenue is Rs 5,227 crore lower than expected mainly because imports have not increased as originally estimated."
8604,1994-95,"There is a shortfall of Rs 2,001 crore in excise duty mainly due to the setback in production in certain high revenue yielding sectors of the economy."
8605,1994-95,"Due to the delay in finalisation of the procedure for disinvestment of equity holding 9 in Public Sector Enterprises, the related receipts this year are estimated at Rs 2,500 crore compared to the Budget estimate of Rs 3,500 crore."
8606,1994-95,The shortfall in receipts has necessitated a larger resort to borrowings.
8607,1994-95,"However, I have made serious efforts to ensure that the increased borrowing does not lead to excessive growth of high powered money."
8608,1994-95,"Instead, we have seen to it that the Government has borrowed on the basis of marketrelated instruments such as the 364 days Treasury Bills which were started in 199293."
8609,1994-95,We have also introduced certain other new instruments such as zero coupon rate bonds and 3 year loans for conversion of maturing 364 days Treasury Bills.
8610,1994-95,"External loans net of repayments are placed at Rs 3,837 crore compared to the Budget estimate of Rs 5,454 crore."
8611,1994-95,"Taking into account other variations in receipts and expenditure, the current year is expected to end with a budget deficit of Rs 9,060 crore."
8612,1994-95,"The fiscal deficit, which was estimated at Rs 36,959 crore in the original Budget, is now expected to go up to Rs 58,551 crore."
8613,1994-95,"The fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP will, therefore, be 7.3 per cent, which is much higher than projected at the budget stage."
8614,1994-95,I am far from happy with this development.
8615,1994-95,"But, as I have stated earlier, there were special circumstances in 199394 which warranted somewhat higher deficit."
8616,1994-95,"In a situation characterised by idle industrial capacity, I was concerned that an attempt to bring about a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit might well have been counterproductive."
8617,1994-95,"However, we cannot afford to repeat large fiscal deficits."
8618,1994-95,We must return to the path of fiscal rectitude.
8619,1994-95,I now turn to the Budget estimates for 199495.
8620,1994-95,"In order to maintain the tempo of development activities, the budgetary support for the Central Plan 199495 has been increased to Rs 27,278 crore from Rs 23,241 crore in Budget estimates 199394, an increase of about 17.4 per cent."

8624,1994-95,"The total budgetary support from the Central Government’s budget to the Central and the State Plans will be increased by 13 per cent from Rs 41,251 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 46,582 crore in 199495."
8625,1994-95,"The increased budgetary support to the Central Plan is being directed to support higher outlays in important social sectors such as Rural Development, Education, Health and Family Welfare and Women and Child Development, and Welfare of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes."
8626,1994-95,"In response to the vital need for greater employment generation and capital formation in rural areas, and in order to focus more sharply on alleviation of rural poverty, the outlay for the Department of Rural Development has been increased from Rs 5,010 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 7,010 crore in 199495, representing a massive increase of 40 per cent over the previous year."
8627,1994-95,"Honourable Members will recall that the allocation for Rural Development was Rs 3,100 crore 10 in Budget estimates 199293."
8628,1994-95,"In two years, we have more than doubled this provision."
8629,1994-95,"For the new Employment Assurance Scheme announced by the Prime Minister on 15th August, 1993, which is being implemented in 1752 identified blocks, an outlay of Rs 1,200 crore has been provided as compared to the 199394 outlay of Rs 600 crore."
8630,1994-95,"Similarly, the allocations for the Jawahar Rozgar Yojana have also been enhanced from Rs 3,306 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 3,855 crore in 199495."
8631,1994-95,It is estimated that 1150 million mandays of employment are likely to be generated in 199495.
8632,1994-95,"I have also increased the allocation for the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme, including the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water Scheme, by Rs 150 crore in 199495."
8633,1994-95,"The Prime Minister’s Rozgar Yojana was launched on October 2, 1993, to provide selfemployment opportunities to one million educated unemployed youth in the country by setting up 7 lakh micro enterprises through industry, service and business ventures."
8634,1994-95,The Scheme intends to cover urban areas during 199394 and whole of the country from 199495 onwards.

8637,1994-95,"A major thrust is being given to horticulture development, with a 42 per cent increase in allocation from Rs 130 crore in Budget estimates199394 to Rs 184 crore in 1994 95."
8638,1994-95,A major scheme for promoting use of plastics in drip irrigation is under implementation for which an enhanced outlay of Rs 45 crore has been kept during 199495.
8639,1994-95,"In the Eighth Plan, we have given high priority to the development of human resources."
8640,1994-95,The bulk of outlay for this sector is in the plans of the States.
8641,1994-95,"The outlay for education in the Central plan is being increased by 17.6 per cent, to Rs 1,541 crore in 199495."
8642,1994-95,"Special efforts are being made for strengthening of elementary education, for which the outlay has been increased from Rs 442 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 523 crore in 199495."
8643,1994-95,The allocation for the University Grants Commission has been increased from Rs 159 crore in the Budget estimates for 199394 to Rs 209 crore in 199495.
8644,1994-95,Special allocations have been made to upgrade the quality of libraries and laboratories in the system of higher education.
8645,1994-95,Provision has also been made for the establishment of an Indian Institute of Technology and for two Central Universities in Assam.
8646,1994-95,The outlay for Health has been increased by nearly 20 per cent from Rs 483 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 578 crore in 199495.

8653,1994-95,"Recognising the critical role of infrastructure, Plan outlays in Power, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Telecommunication, Railways and Transport, have all been increased."
8654,1994-95,"The Plan outlay for power sector has been raised from Rs 7,461 crore in Budget estimates199394 to Rs 8,464 crore in 199495; and within this total, the budget support for this sector has been increased by over 27 per cent from Rs 2,445 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 3,117 crore in 199495."
8655,1994-95,"The Plan outlay for the Telecommunication services has been increased from Rs 6,321 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 7,246 crore in 199495."

8657,1994-95,"We have also increased the budget support to the Railways by 20 per cent from Rs 960 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs 1,150 crore in 199495."
8658,1994-95,"To sustain longterm development, cost recovery for infrastructure services has to become much more effective."
8659,1994-95,Investments in infrastructure sectors must increasingly be financed through internal and extrabudgetary resources of Public Sector Undertakings.
8660,1994-95,The role of science and technology is critical for modernising our economy and making it globally competitive.
8661,1994-95,The outlay for the Department of Science & Technology has been raised by 19 per cent from Rs 189 crore in Budget estimates 199394 to Rs  225 crore in 199495.
8662,1994-95,"Total nonplan expenditure next year is placed at Rs 1,05,117 crore compared to Rs 97,846 crore in the Revised estimates of current year."
8663,1994-95,"I have to draw the attention of the Honourable Members to a major factor which has been contributing to the sizeable increase in nonplan expenditure year after year, and this is the interest burden."
8664,1994-95,"The provision for interest payments next year is placed at Rs 46,000 crore."
8665,1994-95,"This is an increase of Rs 8,000 crore over the current year’s Budget estimates whereas the increase in total nonplan expenditure is Rs 15,045 crore."
8666,1994-95,Honourable Members will appreciate that the major part of the interest burden is a legacy from the past and it continues to grow because of the continued high level of Government borrowing.
8667,1994-95,Interest payments can be reduced only if we can implement a programme of phased reduction in the Government’s total borrowing requirements or fiscal deficit.
8668,1994-95,"This can become a reality only if our tax system becomes more buoyant, our public enterprises generate more internal resources and we reduce expenditure on subsidies."
8669,1994-95,A bold programme for disinvestment of government equity in public enterprises and earmarking a part of the sale proceeds purely for debt reduction would also be of great help.
8670,1994-95,Defence is another important element in nonplan expenditure.
8671,1994-95,We cannot take chances with our national security.
8672,1994-95,"I am, therefore, providing Rs 23,000 crore for Defence as against Rs 19,180 crore in the Budget estimates for 199394 which was itself raised to Rs 21,500 crore in the Revised estimates."
8673,1994-95,"I am providing Rs 4,000 crore each for food subsidy and fertilizers subsidy."
8674,1994-95,I am also providing Rs 341 crore being the balance amount payable by Government under the scheme of Debt Relief to Farmers.
8675,1994-95,"Furthermore, I am providing for a net expenditure of Rs 365 crore on account of Government’s assumption of exchange loss liability on Foreign Currency NonResident Accounts Scheme, which was previously borne by the Reserve Bank of India."
8676,1994-95,"The provision made in next year’s Budget for nonplan expenditure other than the provisions for interest payments and defence is actually Rs 2,729 crore less than in the Revised estimates for the current year."
8677,1994-95,"Coming to receipts, gross tax revenue at existing levels of taxation is placed at Rs 87,136 crore."
8678,1994-95,"States’ share of taxes next year is estimated at Rs 24,394 crore compared to Rs 22,244 crore in the Revised estimates of current year."
8679,1994-95,"External loans net of repayments are placed at Rs 4,279 crore compared to Rs 3,837 crore in the current year’s Revised estimates."
8680,1994-95,"Taking into account maturing liabilities, the net Small Savings collections next year are placed at the same level as in the current year, that is, Rs 6,000 crore."
8681,1994-95,"I am taking a credit of Rs 4,000 crore next year as receipts from disinvestment as a continuation of the policy of mobilising noninflationary resources from the sale of public sector equity."
8682,1994-95,"Total receipts are estimated at Rs 1,45,699 crore and total expenditure at Rs 1,51,699 crore leaving a gap of Rs 6,000 crore."
8683,1994-95,I now turn to the tax proposals for 199495.
8684,1994-95,This year I shall begin with the proposals relating to indirect taxes.
8685,1994-95,"Over the years, our indirect tax structure has grown into a complex maze of high and multiple rates, with numerous exemptions, and different rates being applicable for the same product for different uses and users."
8686,1994-95,"This has resulted in unnecessary complexity leading to administrative abuse, mounting litigation and uncertain economic impact."
8687,1994-95,All this has effectively eroded the tax base and buoyancy of the system and created serious economic distortions.
8688,1994-95,"My proposals, in both customs and central excise, aim at simplifying the structure and continuing the process of moving to moderate rates of taxation."
8689,1994-95,Customs duties though lowered in the past three budgets need to be brought down further to make key imported raw materials and capital goods available to Indian industry at reasonable costs and also to reduce unduly high levels of protection to industry.
8690,1994-95,"At the same time, the scale of duty reduction has to be calibrated to ensure that it does not place unreasonable pressure on domestic producers of similar products."
8691,1994-95,"In this framework, the key features of my customs tariff reform proposals are: · Further reduction in the peak rate of customs duty; · Substantial reduction in duties on key raw materials, such as steel and chemicals; · Reduction in customs duties on capital goods to boost investment combined with other incentives which will help the domestic capital goods industry; · Reduction or removal of anomalies caused by import duties on raw materials and components being higher than on finished products; · A systematic effort to unify rates on similar products to serve both economic rationality and to reduce the scope for classification disputes; 13 ·"
8692,1994-95,"A major pruning of notifications including end use exemptions to about half their present number, thus reducing discretionary power and possibilities for disputes; 57."
8693,1994-95,I propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 85% to 65%.
8694,1994-95,Items like baggage and liquor will however continue to attract higher duty as at present.
8695,1994-95,Availability of capital goods at a reasonable cost is necessary to enhance our competitiveness and promote investment.
8696,1994-95,"It is also necessary to ensure that our domestic capital goods industry, which has tremendous potential, is not at a comparative disadvantage due to anomalies in the tax structure ."
8697,1994-95,"To further both these objectives , I propose the following package of measures: a I propose to reduce basic customs duty on project imports and general capital goods from 35% to 25%."
8698,1994-95,The facility of project imports is being extended to include port development.
8699,1994-95,All this will help to reduce cost of investment and modernisation in Indian industry.
8700,1994-95,"Import duty on parts, whether imported as parts of original equipment, or as spares is also being reduced to 25% from the present rates varying from 25% to 85%."
8701,1994-95,Import duty on fertiliser projects and power projects will continue at nil rate and 20% respectively without any countervailing duty.
8702,1994-95,I propose to accept this demand.
8703,1994-95,I am simultaneously extending the benefit of Modvat to capital goods so that full credit of excise duty paid on domestic capital goods or countervailing duty paid on imported capital goods will be available at one time.
8704,1994-95,This has been a long standing demand of all sectors of Indian industry.
8705,1994-95,"At present, machine tools attract duty at varying rates of 40%, 60% and 80%."
8706,1994-95,I propose to simplify the structure by charging duty at 35% or 45% only.
8707,1994-95,"With the reduction of duty on finished capital goods it is necessary to reduce the customs duty on steel, which is a key input."
8708,1994-95,I propose to reduce the customs duty on steel from a range of 75% to 85% at present to 50%.
8709,1994-95,"Import duties on primary forms of major nonferrous metals copper, zinc and lead are also being unified at 50%."
8710,1994-95,"These proposals will give a strong boost to investment in the economy and will help the domestic capital goods industry, in particular."
8711,1994-95,"To help domestic metal producers, the import duties on all ores and concentrates are being reduced and unified at 10%."
8712,1994-95,"To reduce the cost of inputs for the secondary steel sector, I propose to reduce the import duty on melting scrap from 12.5% to 10% and on iron ore pellets from 15% to 10%."
8713,1994-95,"In order to give a thrust to the export efforts of our leather industry, 14 which is a major export earner, and is also employment intensive, I propose to reduce import duty on a large number of items of machinery and raw materials used in this industry from rates varying from 25% to 50% at present to a uniform level of 20% without the addition of countervailing duty."
8714,1994-95,Electronics and telecommunication are vital for rapid economic development and can greatly contribute to generation of both additional employment and exports.
8715,1994-95,I propose to rationalise the tariff structure for these sectors as follows : a b The import duty on computer parts is being reduced from 80% to 50%.
8716,1994-95,The duty on specified components is being reduced from 50% to 40% and on specified piece parts from 35% to 30%..
8717,1994-95,The import duty on application software is being reduced from 85% to 20% .
8718,1994-95,"In order to encourage the telecommunication sector, I propose to reduce import duty on nonelectronic parts for manufacture of such equipment from 50% to 40% and on optical fibre from 85% to 40% to encourage manufacture of optical fibre cables in the country."
8719,1994-95,"Thethis industry to become internationally competitive, I propose to reduce the import duty on certain items of machinery for the industry from 50% at present to 25%."
8720,1994-95,I also propose to reduce the duty on certain components and raw materials for the watch industry from 70% and 50% at present to 25% and 20% respectively.
8721,1994-95,The present import duty structure for medical equipment is complex and involves in some cases time consuming administrative procedure.
8722,1994-95,The domestic industry is also not able to compete with imported equipment because it is now available dutyfree to hospitals on production of certificates by designated authorities.
8723,1994-95,"In order to remove the above hindrances , I propose to abolish the system of certification for charitable hospitals and freely permit import of specified medical equipment at 15% without any countervailing duty."
8724,1994-95,The list of such equipment is being separately notified and can be expanded on merits.
8725,1994-95,"Import at zero rate for government hospitals and for all specified life saving and sight saving equipment is, however, being continued."
8726,1994-95,Import duty on other medical equipment which is at present 85% is being reduced to 40%.
8727,1994-95,Components for their manufacture will be allowed to be imported at 15% customs duty.
8728,1994-95,This differential will help manufacture of medical equipment by indigenous industry.
8729,1994-95,The import duty structure for coal and petroleum is being simplified.
8730,1994-95,Crude petroleum and coal will attract import duty of 35% as against Rs 1500 per metric tonne and 85% respectively.
8731,1994-95,Duty on coke is being reduced from 85% to 25%.
8732,1994-95,LPG and other petroleum gases will attract import duty at 15%.
8733,1994-95,Naphtha and kerosene will continue to be exempted from basic customs duty.
8734,1994-95,Other petroleum products will attract an import duty of 30%.
8735,1994-95,These changes do not affect the administered prices of petroleum products to consumers.
8736,1994-95,The present import duty structure for chemicals provides for a lower rate of duty of 15% for the basic feed stocks and peak rate of 85% for the finished chemicals.
8737,1994-95,The overall dispersal of the rates is being reduced by the reduction of peak rate to 65%.
8738,1994-95,"In addition, duties on DMT, PTA and MEG are being reduced from 70% to 60% and on intermediates like xylenes and toluene, the duty is being domestic watch industry has a significant growth potential ."
8739,1994-95,To enable 15 reduced from 40% to 30%.
8740,1994-95,The 15% rate for basic feed stocks has been kept undisturbed.
8741,1994-95,"In the pharmaceutical sector, import duty on a large number of raw materials which at present varies from 85% to 50% is being lowered to two rates of 50% or 25%."
8742,1994-95,"In a few cases, there has been some upward adjustment of import duty having regard to the need to protect the interest of domestic manufacturers of drug intermediates."
8743,1994-95,"While I have no doubt that the phased reduction of customs tariffs is essential for the longer term interest of our industry, I am also fully aware of the concern of some industries about the dumping of certain imported goods at artificially low prices."
8744,1994-95,"I assure the House that our anti dumping provisions will be reviewed and further strengthened, if necessary."
8745,1994-95,I now turn to my proposals for central excise.
8746,1994-95,This Budget proposes a major reform of the excise tax structure as part of our programme of modernising our tax system.
8747,1994-95,The principal features of this restructuring are: · Extension of Modvat to capital goods and petroleum products; · Shift in the bulk of excise taxation from specific to ad valorem rates which will assure much greater built in buoyancy of revenues.
8748,1994-95,Reduction in the total number of ad valorem tax rates to about half the existing number which will be a major step towards simplicity and transparency; · Continuing the process of lowering rates when they are unduly high; ·
8749,1994-95,Application of uniform rates for similar commodities to the extent possible.
8750,1994-95,"This will reduce classification problems, scope for misuse and widespread litigation; · Removal of complicated price list procedure; · Reduction of the number of special exemption notifications by about half."
8751,1994-95,"These steps will promote growth of manufacturing output and employment, will make tax administration easier, less discretionary and also reduce the scope for misclassification, disputes and evasion."
8752,1994-95,They will increase revenue elasticity and pave the way for an eventual adoption of a Value Added Tax. 71.
8753,1994-95,"Inevitably, a major restructuring involves changes in many rates for several products as products have to be reclassified into fewer rate categories."
8754,1994-95,"Furthermore, duty rates have been adjusted in some cases to compensate for loss of revenue because of the extension of Modvat."
8755,1994-95,"However, I have ensured that items of mass consumption are not burdened by higher taxes."
8756,1994-95,"For example, full exemption continues for many goods such as handloom products, unbranded drugs, domestic electric bulbs, bicycles, baby food, cooking oil, spices, jams, jellies, sauces, tea and coffee."
8757,1994-95,"And care has been taken not to raise the rates on, for example, sugar, matches and vanaspati."
8758,1994-95,There should be no adverse effect on prices of essential items of consumption of the common man.
8759,1994-95,I will now highlight a few major areas of special interest.
8760,1994-95,"Sir, the House may recall that the Modvat scheme was introduced in 1986."
8761,1994-95,Its subsequent extension has greatly helped to reduce the cascading effect of input taxes.
8762,1994-95,But the coverage remains incomplete.
8763,1994-95,"Petroleum products, textiles, matches, tobacco products and capital goods had been left out of the scheme."
8764,1994-95,There is a persistent demand from industry to make the scheme more comprehensive.
8765,1994-95,"I now propose to extend the Modvat scheme to two important sectors namely, capital goods and petroleum products."
8766,1994-95,I propose to rationalise the structure for petroleum products.
8767,1994-95,"At present, the excise duty rates are specific."
8768,1994-95,There are numerous exemptions depending on the end use.
8769,1994-95,I propose to replace the existing specific rates by a uniform advalorem rate of 10% on all petroleum products with the exception of motor spirit which will attract duty of 20%.
8770,1994-95,End use exemptions will be virtually eliminated.
8771,1994-95,"Existing concessions for the fertilizer industry are, however, being continued."
8772,1994-95,These changes have no impact on the administered prices of these items.
8773,1994-95,The current duty structure for cotton and man made fabrics is a combination of advalorem and specific rates.
8774,1994-95,"I propose to switch over to advalorem rates of 5%, 10% and 20% only instead of the numerous specific and advalorem rates currently prevailing."
8775,1994-95,The present excise duty structure on fibres and yarns is complicated and different specific rates are prescribed for different varieties of yarn and fibres.
8776,1994-95,This has required frequent testing of samples to determine the correct duty liability.
8777,1994-95,"In order to obviate all problems of classification and to make the excise duty neutral as between various fibres and yarns, I propose to impose a uniform excise duty of 20% on all fibres and blended or spun yarns."
8778,1994-95,"On cotton yarn, excise duty is, however, proposed at 5% only instead of the present complex and varying specific rates depending on the count of the yarn."
8779,1994-95,"As regards filament yarns, revenue considerations preclude moving to a uniform excise duty."
8780,1994-95,"I have thus proposed an advalorem duty rate of 60% for polyester filament yarn, 30% for nylon and polypropylene yarn and 15% for viscose filament yarn."
8781,1994-95,"For industrial yarns, lower rates of 30%, 20% and 10% have been prescribed."
8782,1994-95,The scheme of Modvat is being extended to yarns made from fibres.
8783,1994-95,With this Modvat will cover all yarns.
8784,1994-95,These changes are largely a simplification and rationalisation of the structure.
8785,1994-95,"Combined with the reduction in customs duties, they should help to moderate prices in this sector."
8786,1994-95,"I propose to fix a uniform duty of 15% on all metals, except aluminium for which the duty will be 20% as against 25% now."
8787,1994-95,"However, a lower duty of 10% will be available to pig iron and certain other products of iron."
8788,1994-95,"The excise duty structure on drugs differentiates between Schedule I, Schedule II and other drugs."
8789,1994-95,I drugs which are for the National Health Programme and are under price control are fully exempted from excise duty.
8790,1994-95,Single formulations of Schedule II drugs attract excise duty at 10% while other branded drugs pay excise duty at 15%.
8791,1994-95,I propose to unify these rates at 15%.
8792,1994-95,I propose to charge a moderate 10% excise duty on branded ayurvedic and homoeopathic medicines and medicines of other alternative systems.
8793,1994-95,"At present, bulk drugs producers cannot get full benefit of Modvat credit because the excise duty on bulk drugs is 5% which is too low."
8794,1994-95,This is being raised to 10% to enable 17 them to get full credit.
8795,1994-95,"Unbranded drugs, however, will continue to be exempted from excise duty."
8796,1994-95,"In order to simplify the duty structure for various chemicals and chemical based products like dyes, paints, tanning preparations, etc., I am proposing a uniform duty of 20% on such products instead of present rates varying from 5% to 25%."
8797,1994-95,"A uniform duty of 30% is being proposed for major bulk plastics , synthetic paints and detergents, which currently attract 35%."
8798,1994-95,"The paper duty structure is complicated due to advalorem rates of nil, 10%,15%,25%,30%, specific rates and specific cum advalorem rates."
8799,1994-95,"This is now being simplified by making the general rate of duty on paper at 20%, keeping nil rate for news print, stationery articles etc., 30% for paper based laminates and floor coverings and 10% or 15% for paper made from unconventional raw materials."
8800,1994-95,I am enlarging the scope of the exemption currently available to paper mills using unconventional raw materials.
8801,1994-95,This exemption limits the benefit by clubbing the clearances of paper from more than one factory of a manufacturer.
8802,1994-95,I am now allowing this concession to be availed of by each factory separately.
8803,1994-95,The duty rate of 70% applicable to cosmetics and similar personal care products are too high for items which are now increasingly forming part of the consumption basket of ordinary people.
8804,1994-95,"The rate is, therefore, being reduced to 50%."
8805,1994-95,I am also proposing certain changes in the general small scale industry exemption scheme.
8806,1994-95,At present only registered units are eligible for concessions upto a clearance value of Rs  75 lakhs.
8807,1994-95,Nonregistered units can get exemption only up to Rs  30 lakhs.
8808,1994-95,I propose to do away with this distinction so that small scale units can get the exemption meant for them irrespective of whether they are registered or not.
8809,1994-95,This will satisfy one of the major demands of small scale industry.
8810,1994-95,"The scope of the small scale exemption scheme is also being expanded to cover a number of additional items including certain iron, steel and copper products."
8811,1994-95,"Under the present scheme, a small unit manufacturing goods under the brand name of another unit is entitled to duty concession only if the brand name does not belong to a large unit."
8812,1994-95,There have been reports of bigger units avoiding payment of duty by getting their brand names registered in the name of smaller units.
8813,1994-95,This does not allow a small manufacturer to promote his own brand.
8814,1994-95,"With the advent of international brand names in the country, it is necessary to check the misuse of the scheme in the interest of domestic industry."
8815,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose that the benefit of duty concession would not be available to clearances of goods bearing the brand name of another manufacturer."
8816,1994-95,One of the persistent demands of the small scale industries has been to allow them to pay duty even though they are otherwise entitled to exemption as this will enable their customers to claim the benefit of Modvat credit.
8817,1994-95,"There is considerable merit in this request, and I propose to give the option to those who will like to exercise it."
8818,1994-95,"It may be recalled that in the last budget, in order to give encouragement to the ship breaking industry, basic customs duty on ships for breaking up was reduced to 5%."
8819,1994-95,Countervailing duty was payable in addition.
8820,1994-95,Ferrous metals obtained from breaking up of ships were consequently exempted from excise duty.
8821,1994-95,There 18 have been some disputes regarding liability of countervailing duty on ships for breaking up.
8822,1994-95,"In order to obviate the disputes, I propose to exempt ships for breaking up from countervailing duty and correspondingly adjust the basic customs duty to 15%."
8823,1994-95,"For the ship breaking industry, all goods obtained from such breaking up are also proposed to be exempted from excise duty so that ship breaking activity is completely outside the excise control."
8824,1994-95,"As I am continuing the specific rates of duties on cigarettes, and these have remained unchanged for two years despite an increase in price, I propose to increase the duties on cigarettes by about 12%."
8825,1994-95,"However, in the nonfilter segment, the excise duty for upto 60 mm category is being reduced from Rs  120 per thousand to Rs  60 per thousand, for increased utilisation of tobacco in this industry, which would in turn help the tobacco growers."
8826,1994-95,"Over the years, while attempts have been made to widen the base for domestic indirect taxes, the services sector has not been subjected to taxation."
8827,1994-95,Yet this sector accounts for about 40% of our GDP and is showing strong growth.
8828,1994-95,"There is no sound reason for exempting services from taxation , when goods are taxed and many countries treat goods and services alike for tax purposes."
8829,1994-95,The Tax Reforms Committee has also recommended imposition of tax on services as a measure for broadening the base of indirect taxes.
8830,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose to make a modest effort in this direction by imposing a tax on services of telephones, nonlife insurance and stock brokers."
8831,1994-95,"The tax will be charged at 5% on the amount of telephone bills , the net premium charged by the insurance companies, and the brokerage or commission charged by the stock brokers in relation to their services."
8832,1994-95,These proposals will come into force from a date to be notified later on.
8833,1994-95,The existing system of determination of value of goods for charging excise duty is cumbersome and timeconsuming.
8834,1994-95,It involves filing of price lists in advance by the assessee and their approval by the excise officer.
8835,1994-95,The process has to be followed whenever there is a change in the price.
8836,1994-95,"As a measure of procedural simplification, I have decided to dispense with the requirement of price lists."
8837,1994-95,The assessee will now be allowed to pay excise duty on the basis of the value arrived at from the invoice.
8838,1994-95,I am sure that this facility will be widely welcome by the industry.
8839,1994-95,This will also help lay the ground for eventual adoption of a value added tax which relies on invoice value.
8840,1994-95,The details of the revenue implications of the measures announced are given in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Finance Bill.
8841,1994-95,"I have also proposed certain other amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect changes in the Customs Act, and Excise and Customs Tariffs."
8842,1994-95,The amendments are merely enabling provisions and do not have significant revenue implications.
8843,1994-95,"Besides, there are proposals for amendment of some of the existing notifications."
8844,1994-95,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
8845,1994-95,Copies of notifications giving effect to the above changes in customs and excise duties will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
8846,1994-95,I now turn to my direct tax proposals for 199495.
8847,1994-95,"I propose to carry forward the basic philosophy which has guided our tax reforms of moving to a simpler system with moderate rates of tax and a much greater reliance on broadening the base, with better tax administration."
8848,1994-95,"I have received numerous representations from workers, trade unions, and other bodies representing middle class citizens for raising the exemption limit for income tax which is now Rs 30,000."
8849,1994-95,"I am persuaded that there is merit in the demand and I propose to raise the exemption limit to Rs  35,000."
8850,1994-95,"With this, a salary or wage earner with a gross income of Rs  50,000 will pay no incometax."
8851,1994-95,"A working woman with a salary of Rs  52,000 will also pay no tax."
8852,1994-95,I also propose to adjust the tax slabs which have not been changed for two years.
8853,1994-95,"At present, the first bracket is from Rs  30,000 to Rs  50,000 with a tax rate of 20 per cent."
8854,1994-95,"Henceforth the first slab will be Rs  35,000 to Rs  60,000, with the same rate of 20 per cent."
8855,1994-95,"The second slab at present is from Rs  50,000 to Rs  1,00,000 with a tax rate of 30 per cent."
8856,1994-95,"Hereafter, the second slab will be Rs  60,000 to Rs  1,20,000 with the same rate of 30 per cent."
8857,1994-95,"The maximum tax rate of 40 per cent. which at present applies to incomes above Rs 1,00,000 will henceforth be applicable to incomes above Rs  1,20,000."
8858,1994-95,I had stated last year that I was forced to retain the surcharge of 12 per cent on noncorporate incomes for one more year.
8859,1994-95,I am happy to announce that I now propose to withdraw the surcharge completely.
8860,1994-95,"Last year, I had indicated that while major reforms of the corporate tax structure are desirable they would have to be deferred by one year."
8861,1994-95,"I now propose to implement these reforms which will help both our private and public sector companies to save more, invest more, and become more competitive."
8862,1994-95,"At present, widely held companies are taxed at 45 per cent."
8863,1994-95,I propose to do away with the distinction which now exists between the tax rates for widely held and closely held domestic companies and lower both rates to a single rate of 40 per cent.
8864,1994-95,"All domestic companies having income exceeding Rs 75,000 are liable to pay surcharge at the rate of 15 per cent."
8865,1994-95,"Much as I would like to eliminate this surcharge, revenue constraints compel me to continue this levy for the present."
8866,1994-95,"The tax on companies incorporated abroad, but earning income in India, is 65 per cent at present."
8867,1994-95,"In line with the general reduction in corporate tax rates, this rate is being reduced to 55 per cent."
8868,1994-95,"This may call for divestment of part of the business assets or realisation of potential value from dormant assets, both of which will entail long term capital gains tax."
8869,1994-95,This acts as a deterrent to restructuring.
8870,1994-95,"The present rate of such longterm capital gains tax on domestic companies is 40 per cent, whereas longterm capital gains of individuals are taxed at only 20 per cent."
8871,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose to lower the rate of capital gains tax on domestic companies to 30 per cent."
8872,1994-95,This will bring some welcome relief to investors in units who generally belong to lower middle or middle classes.
8873,1994-95,I propose to rationalise the scheme of such taxation by having a uniform rate of 20 per cent.
8874,1994-95,I propose to raise this period of stay to 181 days.
8875,1994-95,"Last year I increased the tax rebate to 20 per cent and also increased the income limit to Rs  75,000."
8876,1994-95,I now propose to raise the tax rebate admissible to them from 20 per cent of the tax due to 40 per cent and make the benefit available to senior citizens having income upto Rs  1 lakh.
8877,1994-95,This causes undue hardship in cases involving handicapped children and their parents.
8878,1994-95,"In order that the posttax income of a child who is physically handicapped is not reduced, I propose to exempt the incomes of such handicapped children from the provisions of clubbing, both under the Incometax and Wealthtax Acts."
8879,1994-95,I propose to include contributions to such a pension fund among the amounts which qualify for tax rebate under Section 88 of the Incometax Act.
8880,1994-95,Several students take loans for their studies.
8881,1994-95,"As a means of helping students from poorer families, who take loans from financial institutions, I propose to allow a deduction from income of Rs 25,000 per year on account of repayments of principal and payment of interest up to a cumulative total of Rs  2 lakhs."
8882,1994-95,"This tax concession will be available to students who undertake graduate or postgraduate studies in Engineering, Medicine or Management, or postgraduate studies in pure sciences, applied sciences, Mathematics or Statistics."
8883,1994-95,"At present, when an assessee makes a contribution to a National Laboratory under the aegis of Indian Council of Agricultural Research, Indian Council of Medical Research or Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, he or she gets a weighted deduction of 125 per cent of the contribution."
8884,1994-95,"I propose to extend this benefit to all Universities, deemed Universities, Indian Institutes of Technology and scientific laboratories under the aegis of the Defence Research and Development Organization, the Department of Electronics, the Department of Biotechnology and the Department of Atomic Energy."
8885,1994-95,I propose to accept their representations.
8886,1994-95,I propose to make legislative amendments for carrying out this commitment.
8887,1994-95,"Recently, certain judicial decisions have been handed down according to which business income of a Goanese family becomes taxable entirely in the hands of a single entity."
8888,1994-95,The decisions affect the timehonoured method of dividing such income equally and assessing such income separately in the hands of the husband and wife.
8889,1994-95,This I understand has given rise to unnecessary tensions and anxiety amongst the Goan couples.
8890,1994-95,"To set at rest all controversies in this area, I propose to make suitable amendments in the Incometax Act to ensure that, excepting for salaries, any other income arising to the citizens governed by the system of community of property in Goa will be divided equally and assessed separately in the hands of the husband and the wife."
8891,1994-95,I propose extending the scope of the benefit by including reimbursement of bills paid by employees to recognised private hospitals.
8892,1994-95,The scheme was to have ended with this year.
8893,1994-95,I propose to continue with the scheme.
8894,1994-95,My hope is that more people will avail of this very simple scheme and come forward readily to contribute their mite to the national tax effort without any fear or inhibition.
8895,1994-95,"In the case of contractors, the net profit will be estimated at 8 per cent."
8896,1994-95,"In the case of truck owners, the income will be estimated at Rs  24,000 per truck per year for Light Commercial Vehicles and Medium Motor Vehicles, and Rs  30,000 per truck per year for Heavy Transport Motor Vehicles."
8897,1994-95,"In both these cases, no further deduction on account of depreciation or interest or other expenses will be allowed."
8898,1994-95,"In both cases, the scheme is optional."
8899,1994-95,This scheme is based on the recommendation of the Chelliah Committee on Tax Reforms.
8900,1994-95,"The scheme will be simple and free of irritants, and I expect an enthusiastic response."
8901,1994-95,There have been repeated and widespread demands that the benefit should be extended to backward districts in other States.
8902,1994-95,I had announced the setting up of a Study Group to go into this question.
8903,1994-95,The Group’s report has been received and is under consideration.
8904,1994-95,"As a stimulus to new investment in backward districts in other States of the country, I propose to extend this concession to such districts which are backward according to certain guidelines which will be prescribed."
8905,1994-95,I propose to give legislative shape to this intention.
8906,1994-95,It has been strongly urged that the present rate of tax on expenditure incurred in hotels discourages tourism.
8907,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of expenditure tax from 20 per cent."
8908,1994-95,I am doing so on the expectation that the State Governments too will follow suit and reduce their taxation on hotels in order to encourage tourism within the country and attract more foreign tourists to our land.
8909,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose to include pollution control among the eligible projects for concession under section 35AC of the Incometax Act, so that a person who makes a contribution to such a project can claim 100 per cent of such contribution as a tax deduction."
8910,1994-95,"Marriages are joyous occasions of family reunion, and honest taxpaying citizens have a right to be free from tax considerations as far as possible on such auspicious occasions."
8911,1994-95,"I, therefore, propose to raise the exemption for such gifts on the occasion of marriage of a dependant relative from Rs 30,000 to Rs 1,00,000."
8912,1994-95,"On the Excise side, the revenue gain is anticipated at Rs  2,106 crores and reliefs will amount to Rs  2,000 crores."
8913,1994-95,"The effect of changes in Direct taxes will result in a loss of Rs  1,075 crores in the personal Incometax collections and Rs  1,355 crores in Corporation tax."
8914,1994-95,The estimated loss on Expendituretax is Rs  75 crores.
8915,1994-95,"Taking into account an estimated gain of Rs  600 crores on account of taxes on services, the total net loss on account of tax measures by conventional methods of calculation amounts to Rs  4,081 crores."
8916,1994-95,The loss to the States on account of reliefs in personal Incometax is Rs  625 crores and the gains on the Excise duty Rs  148 crores.
8917,1994-95,"On the basis of these calculations, the Centre will suffer a net loss of Rs  3604 crores."
8918,1994-95,I have not followed this course of action for several reasons.
8919,1994-95,The revenue loss calculations do not give any credit for simplification and rationalisation of the tax structure which will help revenue collections.
8920,1994-95,Fiscal experts are near unanimous that there is considerable evasion of taxes in our system and that it is possible to reduce tax rates and yet mobilise additional revenue by improving tax administration and compliance.
8921,1994-95,"The simplification in the indirect tax structure that is now being introduced, will reduce the scope for discretion, disputes and 23 litigation, all of which are a source of tax evasion."
8922,1994-95,The shift to advalorem excise duties will also add to buoyancy.
8923,1994-95,I also propose to make a major effort at improving tax administration.
8924,1994-95,Tax laws are going to be administered fairly and firmly.
8925,1994-95,"Computerisation, which has already begun in both Departments, is expected to further improve tax administration."
8926,1994-95,"I also hope that tax payers who have long argued for moderation in the rates of taxes and held out assurances that this would improve compliance, will now live up to their side of the bargain."
8927,1994-95,"They have, in the long run, the most to gain from the success of this experiment."
8928,1994-95,There is always the possibility that things may not work out the way I have assumed.
8929,1994-95,"Although one cannot be dogmatic in these matters, my considered view is that the risks involved in the course of action I have proposed, do not cross the limits of prudence."
8930,1994-95,"The consequence of postponing the tax reform, or of imposing additional taxes to offset the revenue loss as conventionally calculated, would be wholly unproductive in a situation where our economy is characterised by sizeable unutilized industrial capacity, record food stocks and comfortable foreign exchange reserves."
8931,1994-95,"Any such course could give a setback to the economic recovery which our country needs, and which is now on the horizon."
8932,1994-95,"The Budget deficit will therefore remain at Rs  6,000 crores and the fiscal deficit at Rs  54,915 crores."
8933,1994-95,"At this level, the fiscal deficit will be around 6 per cent."
8934,1994-95,"This is higher than I would like to see, but as I have said, all tax reforms involve some risks."
8935,1994-95,Budget is being presented at a critical time for the economy.
8936,1994-95,There are moments in history which call for determined and decisive action.
8937,1994-95,The consequences of inaction or illdesigned responses can be horrendous and are felt for decades to come.
8938,1994-95,"June, 1991 was such a moment."
8939,1994-95,"Thanks to the magnificent leadership provided by the Prime Minister Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, we have been successful in reversing the adverse tide in our fortunes."
8940,1994-95,"However, the task of national reconstruction is by no means over."
8941,1994-95,It is by its very nature a task which should occupy us for the rest of the decade.
8942,1994-95,But we pursue this task today from a stronger position.
8943,1994-95,The economy has been restored to health and shows all the potential for rapid growth in the years ahead.
8944,1994-95,Our agricultural sector is strong and well placed to respond to the new policies.
8945,1994-95,"Our industrial sector, both, private and public, has begun the difficult process of restructuring to face increasingly competitive market conditions."
8946,1994-95,The climate for investment  both domestic and foreign  has vastly improved.
8947,1994-95,"The tax structure now proposed goes a long way towards the kind of modern tax system and moderate tax rates and an emphasis on compliance, which is the hallmark of all successful countries."
8948,1994-95,"I am confident that it will provide a strong stimulus for new investments, economic revival and international competitiveness which is what the economy needs today."
8949,1994-95,The medium term objectives set out in the report of the Tax Reform Committee are now clearly within our reach.
8950,1994-95,"Speaker, Sir, this Budget is inspired by a firm conviction that India has all the material and human resources to be a frontranking nation of the world."
8951,1994-95,"We are on the threshold of a new century, indeed a new millennium."
8952,1994-95,"There are tremendous opportunities, provided we have the wisdom and foresight to seize them."
8953,1994-95,There are also immense dangers if we falter or appear indecisive.
8954,1994-95,"Sir, this 24 then is a time for hard work, for recapturing the high noon of idealism which inspired our freedom struggle, for a firm determination to hold aloft, undimmed and untarnished, the bright torch of India which, as Jawaharlal Nehru was fond of saying, embodies her great and eternal spirit so that its light reaches every home and rekindles hope, faith and courage, and pride in being an Indian."
8955,1994-95,"Let us strive tirelessly, as the great poet Rabindranath Tagore said in his prayer, to build an India where “the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the dreary desert sand of dead habit”."
8956,1994-95,May we be worthy of this noble task and of this ancient and sacred land of India.
8957,1995-96,"Sir,I rise to present the Budget for 199596."
8958,1995-96,"Four years have passed since our Government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri P.V. Narasimha Rao, took office in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis."
8959,1995-96,"Our immediate task was to save the nation from a relentless slide into the abyss of falling production, soaring inflation and deepening poverty."
8960,1995-96,"We dealt swiftly with the immediate crisis and we also worked towards a broader objective of shifting the economy on to a path of rapid, employmentgenerating growth."
8961,1995-96,Our aim was to raise India to her rightful place in the comity of nations.
8962,1995-96,"Sometimes, in the heat of political debate, we lose sight of what has already been achieved."
8963,1995-96,Let me take a few minutes to outline how far we have come since those grim days of 1991: · The growth of our economy had fallen to less than one per cent in 1991 92.
8964,1995-96,"We brought the economy back to a growth of 4.3 per cent per year in the two years thereafter, and growth has accelerated further to 5.3 per cent in 199495."
8965,1995-96,Few countries can claim as quick and smooth a recovery from as deep an economic crisis.
8966,1995-96,Industrial growth had collapsed to about half of one per cent in 199192.
8967,1995-96,"Today, Indian industry is experiencing a vibrant, broadbased recovery with industrial growth of 8.7 per cent in AprilNovember, 1994."
8968,1995-96,The manufacturing sector is growing even faster at 9.2 per cent and the capital goods sector is growing at 24.7 per cent.
8969,1995-96,I hope that those critics who predicted that our industrial and trade reforms would hurt Indian industry will look at the reality and think again. ·
8970,1995-96,"There are signs of a strong revival in domestic industrial investment in 199495 as Indian industry modernises and upgrades technology, and improves competitiveness."
8971,1995-96,"Foreign direct investment is also responding 1 199596 2 well to the new policies, with large investments flowing into key infrastructure sectors such as Power and Telecommunications. ·"
8972,1995-96,Foodgrain production had fallen to 168 million tonnes in 199192.
8973,1995-96,"This year, it will be an alltime record of 185 million tonnes."
8974,1995-96,Our farmers have clearly benefited from the policy of offering remunerative prices and have returned a strong production performance.
8975,1995-96,"Public stocks of foodgrain, which provide an invaluable insurance against bad weather and other contingencies, had declined to 14.7 million tonnes three years ago."
8976,1995-96,"They have been rebuilt to a record level of 31 million tonnes, as on January 1, 1995."
8977,1995-96,Growth has created new jobs for our people.
8978,1995-96,"In 199192, total employment grew by only about 3 million."
8979,1995-96,"In each of the two years thereafter, employment increased twice as fast, with about 6 million new jobs added each year."
8980,1995-96,The increase is expected to be even higher in 199495.
8981,1995-96,"The drawing room Cassandras, who predicted massive unemployment as a consequence of the reforms, have been conclusively proved wrong."
8982,1995-96,The inability to manage our external payments was the immediate cause of our collapse in 1991.
8983,1995-96,"I am sure, Honourable Members are aware of the remarkable change that has taken place in this area."
8984,1995-96,The dollar value of exports fell by 1.5 per cent in 199192.
8985,1995-96,In 199495 our exports have grown by over 17 per cent in the first 10 months.
8986,1995-96,This follows a 20 per cent increase in 199394.
8987,1995-96,Imports have also grown in line with the revival of the economy but the balance of payments situation is comfortable. ·
8988,1995-96,The fears that were voiced in some quarters that our trade policy would generate a disruptive flood of imports and weaken the economy have been shown to be completely unfounded.
8989,1995-96,Liberalisation and openness have actually increased our selfreliance.
8990,1995-96,"Exports now finance over 90 per cent of imports, compared to only about 60 per cent in the latter half of the eighties."
8991,1995-96,The external deficit on current account was over 3 per cent of GDP in 199091.
8992,1995-96,It is expected to be less than 1/2 per cent in 199495.
8993,1995-96,"In 199394, the increase in external debt was reduced to less than one billion dollars."
8994,1995-96,"In the first half of 199495, our external debt stock actually declined by almost 300 million dollars."
8995,1995-96,Our foreign currency reserves had fallen to barely one billion dollars in June 1991.
8996,1995-96,"On March 10, 1995 they stood at over 20 billion dollars."
8997,1995-96,"A key element of our strategy was to give top priority to strengthening anti poverty programmes, once the initial crisis was overcome."
8998,1995-96,We have fulfilled this promise.
8999,1995-96,Plan expenditure on employment and antipoverty programmes in the Central Sector has been increased very sharply in the last two budgets.
9000,1995-96,The allocation for Rural Development has been more than doubled from Rs 3100 crore in 1992 93 BE to over Rs 7000 crore in 199495 BE.
9001,1995-96,"Over the same period the allocation for Elementary Education was increased by 84 per cent, for Adult Education by 78 per cent and for Health by 91 per cent."
9002,1995-96,We inherited an economy near collapse four years ago.
9003,1995-96,"We have transformed 3 it into an economy showing strong growth in agricultural and industrial output, a strong revival of domestic investment, a steady increase in foreign direct investment, renewed growth of employment and a comfortable foreign exchange position."
9004,1995-96,"This is the result of the hard work of our farmers and industrial workers, our managers and exporters, combined with the far sighted economic policies implemented by the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri P.V.Narasimha Rao."
9005,1995-96,"What is most encouraging is the emergence of a broad national consensus in support of reforms, a consensus which vindicates our strategy of moving forward steadily and surely on the path of reform."
9006,1995-96,"We have come a long way, but the journey is far from over."
9007,1995-96,"We need to redouble our efforts in several areas to consolidate our gains, and push the economy to even better performance."
9008,1995-96,This is both feasible and also necessary to achieve our goals.
9009,1995-96,"Reforms in the areas of taxation, trade and industrial policies and the financial sector have yielded good results."
9010,1995-96,"They need to be completed as planned, so as to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of our economy."
9011,1995-96,Barriers to further expansion of agriculture have to be identified and lifted.
9012,1995-96,The public sector has to be revamped.
9013,1995-96,Industrial relations have to provide for greater flexibility in deployment of labour.
9014,1995-96,"Delivery systems for social services have to be modernised, plugging loopholes and promoting cost effectiveness."
9015,1995-96,Capital market reforms have to be widened and deepened to strengthen investor protection.
9016,1995-96,Insurance sector reforms have to be pursued with the aim of greatly widening access to insurance services and promoting competitive and efficient customeroriented services.
9017,1995-96,We must and will push ahead in all these areas.
9018,1995-96,"There are also some weak spots, which have surfaced and need to be addressed urgently."
9019,1995-96,"After the initial successes in fiscal consolidation, further progress has proved much more difficult."
9020,1995-96,The fiscal deficit increased sharply in 199394 and the pressure on the deficit has continued in 199495.
9021,1995-96,These developments must be countered through determined action.
9022,1995-96,"If we try to fund every project and programme irrespective of the revenues available, we only generate high inflation, high interest rates which choke off investment, and a proliferation of underfunded, incomplete projects."
9023,1995-96,This approach will only jeopardise our basic objective of development with social justice since it is the poor who will suffer most from the resultant inflation and slow growth of employment opportunities.
9024,1995-96,"We must, therefore, ensure that fiscal discipline is further improved in the years ahead."
9025,1995-96,"We had succeeded in lowering the rate of inflation from the peak of 17 per cent in 1991 to around 7 per cent in the middle of 1993, but since then inflation has accelerated again and currently exceeds 11 per cent."
9026,1995-96,This acceleration has occurred because of several factors.
9027,1995-96,One reason is the sharp increase in procurement prices in the previous three years.
9028,1995-96,"Another factor is the shortfall in production in critical sectors such as sugar, cotton and oilseeds."
9029,1995-96,"The persistence of fiscal deficits at levels higher than they should be, has also contributed to inflationary pressure."
9030,1995-96,"Recognizing these problems, we will tackle inflation on a priority basis in the year ahead."
9031,1995-96,Monetary policy has already been tightened to reduce the growth of money supply.
9032,1995-96,Interest rates on bank deposits have been raised to give greater encouragement to savings.
9033,1995-96,"Taking advantage of the improved foreign exchange 4 position, imports of key essential commodities, such as sugar, cotton, pulses and edible oils have been freely allowed with zero or low duties to moderate inflationary pressure."
9034,1995-96,We are also taking advantage of the comfortable foodgrain stocks to undertake continuous open market sales of wheat and rice with a view to moderating price pressure in these items.
9035,1995-96,The Public Distribution System PDS has been strengthened and supplies through the PDS are being supplemented by necessary imports of sugar and edible oils.
9036,1995-96,"Over the coming year, we will use all instruments available to ensure stability in prices of wheat, rice and edible oils."
9037,1995-96,Tariff and trade policies will be deployed to ensure that domestic prices of industrial products do not rise unduly.
9038,1995-96,The consumer movement will be strengthened and Government will be vigilant in curbing restrictive practices and hoarding.
9039,1995-96,"My revenue proposals, to which I will come a little later, are also designed to check inflation in commodities of mass consumption."
9040,1995-96,Infrastructure is another area of potential weakness.
9041,1995-96,"If we are to aim at economic growth of 7 to 8 per cent, which has been achieved in other countries and which alone can provide the jobs we need for our growing labour force, then we need much larger investment and much greater efficiency in key infrastructure sectors such as power, roads, ports, irrigation, railways and telecommunications."
9042,1995-96,Sound financial management holds the key to progress in this area.
9043,1995-96,"Adequate supply of quality infrastructure depends crucially on the financial viability of these sectors, which in turn depends upon the adoption of reasonable cost recovery policies."
9044,1995-96,"To take the example of power, many State Governments are unable to finance new investment in power generation because of the financial weakness of the State Electricity Boards."
9045,1995-96,"Taking advantage of the Central Government’s initiative to encourage private investment in power generation, many State Governments are actively trying to attract private sector investments into this area."
9046,1995-96,But private sector investors are unwilling to invest in Power unless the State Governments and the Central Government provide guarantees and counterguarantees to reassure the private sector producers that they will be paid for the power they generate.
9047,1995-96,"Such counterguarantees are justifiable only if they are viewed as providing temporary breathing space, during which State Electricity Boards undertake necessary reforms of their institutional structure, operating practices and pricing policies."
9048,1995-96,"In the long run, we cannot escape the reality that the users of electricity must pay for its cost."
9049,1995-96,The same criterion holds for other infrastructure sectors also.
9050,1995-96,"Once financial viability is assured, we can expect a renewed surge of both public sector and private sector investments in these areas."
9051,1995-96,I shall now deal with some issues of social equity and poverty alleviation.
9052,1995-96,"In my first Budget speech itself, I had emphasised that economic growth and restructuring are not ends in themselves."
9053,1995-96,They are only the means to improving the lives of ordinary citizens.
9054,1995-96,I wish to assure the House that this concern has been central to our strategy from the very beginning.
9055,1995-96,"Experience in our own country, as also from all over the world, shows that the surest antidote to poverty is rapid and broad based growth."
9056,1995-96,This is precisely what our economic reforms seek to achieve.
9057,1995-96,We also recognise that the fruits of growth will take time to reach some of the poorest and weakest sections of our society.
9058,1995-96,"To ensure that they too derive benefit in the short run, we have given the highest priority to strengthening programmes of rural development, employment generation, primary education, primary health and other key social sector programmes."
9059,1995-96,"These programmes, coupled with 5 accelerating economic growth over the last three years, are beginning to have desirable effects on employment and poverty."
9060,1995-96,I have already mentioned that total employment is expanding much faster than three years ago.
9061,1995-96,Real wages of agricultural labourers had declined in 199192 during the crisis.
9062,1995-96,They had increased above precrisis levels by 199394.
9063,1995-96,"Available information on vital statistics, like the crude death rate and the infant mortality rate, also indicates a clear recovery in general living standards after 199192."
9064,1995-96,"The message is clear: the task of lifting the ageold burden of poverty in our society is daunting, but we are on the right track."
9065,1995-96,"We must persevere with our twotrack strategy of accelerating growth, investment and modernisation on the one track, and strengthening antipoverty programmes on the other."
9066,1995-96,The Central Plan allocations and the tax proposals in this Budget are designed to advance both elements of this strategy.
9067,1995-96,"Before coming to these proposals, I would like to outline some new initiatives aimed at strengthening the incomeearning opportunities for the weaker segments of our society."
9068,1995-96,Inadequacy of public investment in agriculture is today a matter of general concern.
9069,1995-96,"This is an area which is the responsibility of the States, but many States have neglected investment in infrastructure for agriculture."
9070,1995-96,"There are many rural infrastructure projects, which have been started but are lying incomplete for want of resources."
9071,1995-96,They represent a major loss of potential income and employment to the rural population.
9072,1995-96,"To encourage quicker completion of projects in rural infrastructure, I propose to establish a new Rural Infrastructural Development Fund within the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD from April 1995."
9073,1995-96,"The Fund will provide loans to State Governments and State owned Corporations for completing ongoing projects relating to medium and minor irrigation, soil conservation, watershed management and other forms of rural infrastructure."
9074,1995-96,The loans will be on a projectspecific basis with repayment and interest guaranteed by the concerned State Government.
9075,1995-96,Priority will be assigned to projects which can be completed within the least time period.
9076,1995-96,"Resources for the Fund will come from commercial banks which will be required by Reserve Bank of India RBI to contribute an amount equivalent to a bank’s shortfall in achieving the priority sector target for agricultural lending, subject to a maximum of 1.5 per cent of the bank’s net credit."
9077,1995-96,"This is expected to create a corpus of about Rs 2,000 crore for completion of rural infrastructure projects."
9078,1995-96,Our Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes citizens are amongst the poorest members of our rural society.
9079,1995-96,"In the one hundred predominantly tribal districts, NABARD will open an exclusive line of credit to Cooperatives and Regional Rural Banks for meeting the credit needs of Scheduled Tribes."
9080,1995-96,Rs 400 crore will be earmarked for this purpose during 199596.
9081,1995-96,NABARD will also earmark a further Rs 100 crore for financing Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes beneficiaries identified by the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Corporations.
9082,1995-96,This amount would be available to the commercial and cooperative banks for meeting the investment needs of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe beneficiaries in both farm and nonfarm activities.
9083,1995-96,Khadi and village industries provide crucial nonfarm earning opportunities to our rural population.
9084,1995-96,"I propose to establish a new scheme under 6 which the banking system will provide Rs 1,000 crore on a consortium basis to the Khadi and Village Industries Commission KVIC, which will lend to viable khadi and village industry units, either directly or through State level Khadi and Village Industries Boards KVIBs."
9085,1995-96,"The Central and State Governments will guarantee these loans by commercial banks to KVIC and KVIBs, respectively."
9086,1995-96,The handloom sector employs millions of poor weavers.
9087,1995-96,"At present, NABARD refinancing to this sector is restricted to the flow of credit through the District and State Cooperative Banks."
9088,1995-96,"Henceforth, NABARD will extend refinancing to commercial banks also for extending credit to cooperative handloom institutions."
9089,1995-96,Steps are also being taken to accelerate the flow of credit to the Handloom Centres and Quality Dyeing Units coming under the scheme initiated last year.
9090,1995-96,Our Small Scale Industries employ 14 million workers and account for 40 per cent of our total manufacturing output and 35 per cent of our exports.
9091,1995-96,"This dynamic sector must be strengthened and assisted to better serve the goals of growth, employment generation and selfreliance through exports."
9092,1995-96,A Technology Development and Modernization Fund will be established in the Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI to provide financial assistance to quality projects aimed at strengthening the export capability of smallscale industries.
9093,1995-96,The initial amount earmarked for this Fund will be Rs 200 crore.
9094,1995-96,"The financial assistance, which would be directly provided by SIDBI to eligible smallscale units, can take the form of either loans or equity."
9095,1995-96,"A National Equity Fund Scheme was established in 1987, to provide equity assistance to tiny small scale units with projects of less than Rs 10 lakhs and located in places with a population not exceeding 5 lakhs 15 lakhs in the case of Hill Areas and the North Eastern Region."
9096,1995-96,"I propose to extend the National Equity Fund Scheme to all tiny smallscale units irrespective of their location, except for units in metropolitan areas."
9097,1995-96,"Furthermore, the scope of this scheme will be enlarged to cover expansion, modernization, technology upgradation and diversification."
9098,1995-96,"The scheme, which is managed by SIDBI, will continue to be funded by the Central Government and SIDBI on 50:50 basis."
9099,1995-96,Adequate availability of credit from the banking system is critical for the small scale sector.
9100,1995-96,"The Government, in consultation with banks, has formulated a Seven Point Action Plan for improving the flow of credit to this sector."
9101,1995-96,"A key feature of the Plan is the setting up of specialized bank branches to serve the needs of small scale units in 85 identified districts, each with more than 2,000 registered small scale units."
9102,1995-96,The public sector banks will ensure that 100 such dedicated branches are operational before the end of 199596.
9103,1995-96,The North Eastern region of our country merits special attention.
9104,1995-96,"With a view to accelerating industrial development, a new North Eastern Development Bank NEDB is being established to finance creation, expansion and modernization of industrial enterprises and infrastructure projects in the region."
9105,1995-96,The Bank will be located within the region.
9106,1995-96,It will have an authorized capital of Rs 500 crore.
9107,1995-96,"Initial contributions to capital will be provided by All India Financial Institutions such as IDBI, ICICI and UTI, providing scope for contribution from other investors subsequently."
9108,1995-96,"In addition to these measures for enhancing income earning opportunities for the weaker sections of our society, I am pleased to announce four farreaching programmes for the general welfare of the poor, especially in rural areas."
9109,1995-96,The first programme addresses the serious deficiency in housing facilities for the rural poor.
9110,1995-96,"As Honourable Members are aware, there is a major ongoing rural housing programme, the Indira Awas Yojana."
9111,1995-96,"About 4 lakh dwelling units are expected to be provided on a subsidized basis in 199495 to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and freed bonded labourers."
9112,1995-96,"For 199596, the housing target is being more than doubled to 10 lakh units."
9113,1995-96,"With this initiative, we will be able to build 50 lakh rural dwelling units in the next five years."
9114,1995-96,This will go a long way towards solving the critical shortage for basic shelter among rural poor.
9115,1995-96,"The greatest hardships among the poor are often suffered by the old and the weak, most of whom are unemployable."
9116,1995-96,"To soften the hardship in their twilight years, a National Social Assistance Scheme has been proposed to cover the poor and needy."
9117,1995-96,One component of the scheme is the provision of a national minimum old age pension of Rs 75 per month to people above 65 years of age who are below the poverty line.
9118,1995-96,"A second component provides lumpsum survivor benefits to poor households, on the death of the primary bread earner, of Rs 5000."
9119,1995-96,The third component aims at provision of sustenance for prenatal and postnatal maternity care to women belonging to poor households for the first two births.
9120,1995-96,The scheme will eventually cover about 14 million neediest beneficiaries from households below the poverty line.
9121,1995-96,"Three quarters of the beneficiaries are likely to be women needing assistance on account of old age, widowhood and maternity."
9122,1995-96,"The Scheme, to be funded jointly by the Centre and the States, will be implemented by the States through Panchayati Raj institutions."
9123,1995-96,"For this purpose, I am appointing a Committee to work out the details of this Scheme."
9124,1995-96,The social assistance package will be complemented by a new Group Life Insurance Scheme of the LIC which will be implemented by Panchayats in rural areas.
9125,1995-96,"Under this scheme, life cover of Rs 5000 will be provided for a modest annual premium of around Rs 70."
9126,1995-96,"For poor households, the Central Government will subsidise 25 per cent of the premium with the State Government meeting an equal amount and the beneficiary contributing 50 per cent."
9127,1995-96,The subsidy will be limited to one policy per poor household.
9128,1995-96,"For the others, there will be no subsidy on the premium."
9129,1995-96,The object of the scheme is a massive promotion of social insurance and thrift in rural areas with the active involvement of Panchayats.
9130,1995-96,"For poor households, it will provide a second tier of partly subsidised security supplementing the survivor benefit and will also inculcate the habit of saving."
9131,1995-96,The LIC will be working out the details of the scheme.
9132,1995-96,Schemes to provide midday meals for school children have a beneficial impact not only on child nutrition but also on school attendance.
9133,1995-96,Some of the State Governments have been operating school midday meals schemes.
9134,1995-96,"As part of the emphasis being laid by this Government on the primary education, and taking into account the comfortable food stocks with the public sector agencies, it is appropriate that the Central Government should be willing to participate in phased expansion of these schemes."
9135,1995-96,"The modality of implementing this, with necessary local variations, will be worked out by a Committee to make it operational in 199596."
9136,1995-96,"Taken as a whole, these new initiatives for funding agricultural infrastructure, promoting handlooms and khadi and village industries, expanding rural housing and introducing social insurance will greatly strengthen the anti 8 poverty component of our strategy."
9137,1995-96,"In parallel, we will also continue with the economic reforms, which have already yielded excellent results."
9138,1995-96,"The industrial, trade and tax reforms, which have created demonstrable buoyancy in industrial production, investment and exports, will be continued, with a special effort to improve implementation at the ground level."
9139,1995-96,"An important positive development is the upsurge of investment proposals in infrastructure sectors, such as power and telecommunications."
9140,1995-96,We will ensure that the flow of investment into these critical sectors is expedited.
9141,1995-96,Reforms in the capital markets are being pursued vigorously.
9142,1995-96,Major amendments have been made recently in the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI Act to give SEBI powers for effective regulation of the capital markets.
9143,1995-96,We propose to introduce legislation to set up Central Depositories later this year.
9144,1995-96,We will continue our efforts at financial sector reforms.
9145,1995-96,"In my speech last year, I had drawn attention to the report of the Committee on Reforms in the Insurance Sector and indicated that we would evolve a broad consensus on the future direction of reform."
9146,1995-96,"As a first step, I propose to establish an independent Regulatory Authority for the Insurance industry."
9147,1995-96,Necessary legislation will be introduced shortly.
9148,1995-96,I shall now briefly go over the Revised Estimates for 199495.
9149,1995-96,"The Budget Estimates for 199495 had placed the total expenditure at Rs 1,51,699 crore."
9150,1995-96,"This is now expected to go up to Rs 1,62,272 crore, an increase of Rs 10,573 crore."
9151,1995-96,"Budget Estimates for the current year provided Rs 46,582 crore as budget support for Plan expenditure."
9152,1995-96,"This is being enhanced to Rs 48,761 crore to accommodate additional assistance to the State Plans and additional allocations for the MPs Local Area Scheme."
9153,1995-96,"NonPlan expenditure in the current year is placed at Rs 1,13,511 crore which represents an increase of Rs 8,394 crore over the Budget Estimates."
9154,1995-96,Additional provision has had to be made in the Revised Estimates towards food and fertilizer subsidies.
9155,1995-96,"The provision for food subsidy has to be substantially increased by Rs 1,100 crore because of the time lag in the revision of issue prices of foodgrains."
9156,1995-96,"Fertilizer subsidy is being increased by Rs 1,166 crore from the budgeted level to cover the requirement of imports and to clear past arrears."
9157,1995-96,There has been an unprecedented rise in collections from small savings schemes this year.
9158,1995-96,"Consequently, an additional amount of Rs 4,497 crore is being provided in the Revised Estimates as loans to States and Union Territories."
9159,1995-96,"Gross tax revenues were estimated at Rs 87,136 crore in the Budget Estimates."
9160,1995-96,"I am happy to report that our tax reforms are beginning to have the expected impact and gross tax revenues are Rs 2,695 crore higher than the Budget Estimates, reaching a figure of Rs 89,831 crore in the Revised Estimates for 1994 95."
9161,1995-96,"This is a vindication of our strategy of tax reform, and also a tribute to the hard work and dedication of the revenue department, without whose unstinting efforts this result could not have been achieved."
9162,1995-96,"External loans, net of repayment, are placed at Rs 3,947 crore compared to the Budget Estimates of Rs 4,279 crore."
9163,1995-96,"Though tax collections and other nondebt receipts have been higher than budgeted, the gains have been outweighed by much larger increases in plan and nonplan expenditure."
9164,1995-96,"The fiscal deficit was originally budgeted at Rs 54,915 crore or 6 per cent of GDP."
9165,1995-96,"The fiscal deficit in the Revised Estimates comes to Rs 61,035 crore which is about 6.7 per cent of GDP."
9166,1995-96,"However, nearly three quarters of this deterioration is due to the extraordinary rise in small saving collections, 75 per cent of which are passed on to the States."
9167,1995-96,"Thus the bulk of the deterioration in the fiscal deficit is not on account of increased expenditure of the Central Government, but only a reflection of larger small savings as compared to the Budget Estimates, which are on lent to the States."
9168,1995-96,"If this element is excluded, the Centre’s fiscal deficit would be only 6. 2 per cent of GDP compared to the Budget target of 6 per cent."
9169,1995-96,"The Tenth Finance Commission TFC submitted its Report covering the five year period of 19952000, on November 26, 1994."
9170,1995-96,The Report recommends a substantial increase in transfers to the States.
9171,1995-96,"Despite the severe constraint on the Centre’s resources, the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Commission and these are being implemented with effect from 199596."
9172,1995-96,"The flow of funds based on Finance Commission devolution and transfers will increase by about 22 per cent, from Rs 28,832 crore in 199495 to Rs 35,055 crore in 199596."
9173,1995-96,We expect the States to use the additional resources for the purposes for which they are released and ensure that the fruits of the schemes reach the intended beneficiaries.
9174,1995-96,I now turn to the Budget Estimates for 199596.
9175,1995-96,"The total expenditure is estimated at Rs 1,72,151 crore."
9176,1995-96,"The total budgetary support from the Central Government’s budget to the Central and the State Plans is being placed at Rs 48,500 crore in 199596, which represents an increase of Rs 1,918 crore over the level in Budget Estimates 199495."
9177,1995-96,"The total outlay of the Central Plan 199596 has been increased to Rs 78,849 crore from Rs 70,141 crore in the Budget Estimates 199495."
9178,1995-96,"The budgetary support for the Central Plan 199596 has been increased to Rs 28,994 crore from Rs 27,278 crore in the Budget Estimates 199495."
9179,1995-96,"The balance will be met by the internal and extra budgetary resources of the Central Public Sector Enterprises to the extent of 63 per cent, as against 61 per cent in Budget Estimates 199495."
9180,1995-96,"I am providing Rs 19,506 crore as Central Plan assistance to States and Union Territories in the Budget Estimates 199596 compared to Rs 19,304 crore in Budget Estimates 199495."
9181,1995-96,"It is relevant to note that the plan transfer to States and UTs for 199495 include Rs 2,680 crore as part of the Ninth Finance Commission decisions."
9182,1995-96,Tenth Finance Commission has not suggested any transfer on Plan Account.
9183,1995-96,"Thus the discretionary plan transfer by the Centre to States and UT goes up from Rs 16,624 crore in 199495 to Rs 19,506 crore in 199596, yielding an increase of over 17%."
9184,1995-96,This amount has to be viewed in the background of substantial increase in transfers to the States as a result of the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission.
9185,1995-96,"In line with our strategy of giving priority to programmes which directly benefit the poor, budgetary support to the Central Plan is being concentrated on Rural Development, Employment and Povertyalleviation programmes and human resource development sectors."
9186,1995-96,"As Honourable Members are aware, the directly targeted Rural Development programmes for eradicating rural poverty have received 10 special emphasis and enhanced outlays during the reform process."
9187,1995-96,"In the last budget, the outlay for the Department of Rural Development was raised to Rs 7,010 crore, more than double the amount of Rs 3,100 crore budgeted two years earlier in 199293."
9188,1995-96,"For 199596, this allocation is being further increased to Rs  7,700 crore."
9189,1995-96,"With this, we will be well on the way to meeting the Eighth Five Year Plan target of Rs 30,000 crore of Central Plan outlay for Rural Development."
9190,1995-96,It is estimated that the Rural Employment programmes under the Department of Rural Development generated about 800 million mandays of employment in 199192.
9191,1995-96,"In 199596, these programmes are estimated to generate 1290 million mandays of employment."
9192,1995-96,The Annual Plan of 199596 will continue to lay stress on improving productivity in the agricultural sector and diversifying the pattern of agriculture into higher value generating farm schemes like horticulture.
9193,1995-96,"Revitalising the cooperatives for providing credit inputs and extension support, marketing and processing would be another thrust area."
9194,1995-96,"The flow of agricultural credit through cooperatives is projected at Rs 14,000 crore in 199596, as compared to an estimate of about Rs 12,000 crore in 199495."
9195,1995-96,Assistance will be given to 220 cooperative societies for women and 330 cooperative societies for weaker sections.
9196,1995-96,"It is expected that over 38,000 hectares would be brought under drip irrigation."
9197,1995-96,"Integrated pest management, which is ecofriendly, will be extended and 1500 trainingcum demonstrations will be organised to train over 50,000 farmers."
9198,1995-96,The spread of educational opportunities is essential for social and economic development.
9199,1995-96,"Despite severe budgetary constraints, the Plan Outlay for Education in 199596 is being increased from Rs 1,541 crore in 199495 to Rs 1,825 crore in 199596."
9200,1995-96,"Elementary Education is particularly important, especially for improving the position of girls and women in our society."
9201,1995-96,The outlay for Elementary Education is being increased substantially by 24.5 per cent to Rs 651 crore.
9202,1995-96,"Under Operation Black Board, primary schools with enrolment of more than 100 children are being provided a third teacher."
9203,1995-96,The allocation for Operation Black Board is being increased by 30 per cent for 199596.
9204,1995-96,The allocation for postmatric scholarships for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has been increased from Rs 105 crore in 199495 to Rs 145 crore in 199596.
9205,1995-96,This will help additional coverage of deserving students.
9206,1995-96,"To assist the State Governments, Government of India is passing on all the external assistance received for Primary Education as grants to State Governments, irrespective of the terms on which the assistance is received by the Central Government."
9207,1995-96,"The combined Plan Outlay for the Departments of Health and Family Welfare is being increased to Rs 2,251 crore in 199596."
9208,1995-96,"The allocation for the National Malaria Eradication Programme for 199596 is being increased by 32 per cent to Rs 139 crore, so that coverage can be extended to 163 million people with top priority being accorded to tribal areas and North Eastern States where the problem of malaria has been endemic."
9209,1995-96,Rs 80 crore is being allocated in 199596 for the Leprosy Control Programme which aims to eliminate transmission of this disease by the year 2000.
9210,1995-96,"An allocation of Rs 726 crore is proposed for Family Welfare Services directly meant for rural areas, including Rs 160 crore for maintenance of 5435 Rural Family Welfare Centres and Rs 190 crore for the maintenance of 9577 Rural SubCentres."
9211,1995-96,"Total nonPlan expenditure in 199596 is estimated to be Rs 1,23,651 crore."
9212,1995-96,"The outlay for Defence has been increased to Rs 25,500 crore, keeping in mind national security imperatives."
9213,1995-96,"An amount of Rs 5,400 crore is being earmarked for fertiliser subsidy in 199596."
9214,1995-96,"In addition, Rs 500 crore has been earmarked for cheaper supply of phosphatic and potassium fertilisers to farmers, thus raising the total effective fertiliser subsidy to Rs 5,900 crore."
9215,1995-96,"Food subsidy receives an allocation of Rs 5,250 crore."
9216,1995-96,"Turning to revenue receipts, gross tax revenues at the existing rates of taxation, are estimated at Rs 1,03,762 crore."
9217,1995-96,"The payment of share of taxes to States is placed at Rs 29,388 crore."
9218,1995-96,"The net revenue receipts to the Centre, including nontax revenues are estimated to increase from Rs 86,084 crore in 199495, to Rs 1,00,787 crore in 199596."
9219,1995-96,"In the area of capital receipts, traditional market borrowings are put at Rs 3,700 crore."
9220,1995-96,"Other medium and long term loans are estimated at Rs 19,000 crore and short term loans at Rs 4,387 crore."
9221,1995-96,"Net external assistance is estimated at Rs 4,456 crore."
9222,1995-96,"As in previous years, the Government intends to continue the process of disinvestment of the equity of public sector enterprises."
9223,1995-96,"The Budget Estimates provide for receipts from disinvestment of Rs 7,000 crore, a significant increase from the figure of Rs 5,237 crore in the Revised Estimates for 199495."
9224,1995-96,"Taking into account other changes in receipts and expenditure, total receipts at existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 1,67,151 crore, while total expenditure is estimated at Rs 1,72,151 crore."
9225,1995-96,"This results in a budget deficit of Rs 5,000 crore."
9226,1995-96,"The fiscal deficit emerging from these estimates for 199596 will be Rs 57,634 crore, which will be about 5.5 per cent of GDP."
9227,1995-96,"I would have liked to do better, but on balance I feel that a fiscal deficit of this order can be absorbed, if the existing growth momentum is maintained."
9228,1995-96,I now turn to my tax proposals for 199596.
9229,1995-96,"Over the past three years, we have made a number of structural changes in our tax laws covering both direct and indirect taxes."
9230,1995-96,"Unlike earlier isolated attempts to modify the tax system, these changes were part of a medium term programme of tax reform guided by certain general principles that have gained wide acceptability."
9231,1995-96,"We wanted to build a structure which is simple, relies on moderate tax rates but with a wider base and better enforcement, serves the objectives of equity and provides the incentives and signals consistent with developing an internationally competitive, dynamic economy."
9232,1995-96,"Direct taxation is the most equitable form of raising revenues, but our experience in the earlier years of high tax rates showed that high rates did not lead to high collections."
9233,1995-96,I am happy to report that our decision to reduce rates and thereby encourage compliance has yielded good results.
9234,1995-96,"Personal income and corporation taxes, taken together, are expected to increase by more than 25 per cent in 199495."
9235,1995-96,The share of direct taxes in GDP has increased from 2.1 per cent in 199091 to 2.8 per cent in 199495.
9236,1995-96,"In the area of customs duty our objective was to reduce the high rates 12 of import duty gradually, so as to lower costs of production and improve competitiveness of user industries while allowing domestic producers facing competition from imported goods reasonable time to adjust."
9237,1995-96,"The strong growth of Indian industry in 199495, to which I have referred earlier, demonstrates conclusively that customs duty reforms have succeeded in imparting the necessary dynamism to industrial production."
9238,1995-96,"In the area of excise duties, our objectives were to simplify the structure, broaden the base, reduce high rates of duty which encourage evasion, shift to ad valorem rates as far as possible and extend the coverage of MODVAT."
9239,1995-96,The results are evident in the impressive growth of excise revenues in 199495.
9240,1995-96,I am reassured by these results that our basic strategy of tax reforms stands fully vindicated.
9241,1995-96,"Together with administrative steps being taken to improve revenue collection, I am now confident that we can create a tax structure which will ensure buoyant revenues while also stimulating growth of production and employment."
9242,1995-96,"Mr. Speaker Sir, after this brief overview, I would like to present the details of my proposals relating to direct taxes."
9243,1995-96,"I have received many representations from Members of Parliament, trade unions and others requesting for increase in the exemption limit for personal incometax."
9244,1995-96,Our Government has consistently responded to the genuine needs of the common man.
9245,1995-96,"I, therefore, propose to further raise the exemption limit for income tax from Rs 35,000 at present, to Rs  40,000."
9246,1995-96,We need to strengthen incentives for savings.
9247,1995-96,"At present, under section 80L of the Incometax Act, income by way of interest and dividend from certain specified financial assets is exempt from income tax to the extent of Rs 10,000 per annum."
9248,1995-96,"In order to provide greater fillip to domestic savings by individuals and HUFs, I propose to raise this limit to Rs 13,000."
9249,1995-96,This will provide both relief and an added incentive for savers.
9250,1995-96,"With these changes, a salaried individual will not pay any tax upto a salary level of Rs 55,000."
9251,1995-96,"In the case of working women, this limit is even higher at Rs  58,000."
9252,1995-96,"In addition, such an individual would benefit from an additional exemption of Rs 13,000 if he or she takes full advantage of the exemption for income from savings instruments under section 80 L."
9253,1995-96,"The tax exempt income could therefore reach a maximum of Rs 68,000 generally and Rs 71,000 for working women."
9254,1995-96,It is only beyond this level that such individuals will start paying tax and that too only at modest rates.
9255,1995-96,Inadequate infrastructure is a key constraint to our economic progress.
9256,1995-96,"In order to promote expansion of quality infrastructure, I propose to allow a five year tax holiday for any enterprise which builds, maintains and operates infrastructure facilities in the area of highways, expressways and new bridges, airports, ports and rapid mass transport systems."
9257,1995-96,"This tax holiday will be available to enterprises which commence operation after 1st April,1995 ."
9258,1995-96,"As an incentive to financial institutions to provide longterm finance for development of such infrastructure, I propose to allow a deduction of upto 40 per cent of their taxable income derived from financing of these investments, provided this amount is credited to a special reserve."
9259,1995-96,"Under section 80IA of the Incometax Act, new industrial undertakings, hotels and shipping concerns commencing operation before 31st March,1995 are entitled to a deduction of 30 per cent of their income if they are companies or 25 per cent of their income if they are noncorporate entities."
9260,1995-96,"This incentive is available to cooperative societies for the first 12 years, and to others for the first 10 years of operation."
9261,1995-96,"As a special measure of support to small scale industries, I propose to extend this concession to them for five more years."
9262,1995-96,"Thus, new industrial undertakings in the small scale sector which commence operation before 31st March, 2000 will be eligible for this concession."
9263,1995-96,Exports of software have grown rapidly and represent a potentially dynamic segment of export earnings.
9264,1995-96,"Software exporters have, however, represented that the deduction under section 80HHE available to them is extended from year to year whereas section 80HHC for export of goods is openended."
9265,1995-96,I propose to accede to their request to place section 80HHE on the same basis as section 80HHC.
9266,1995-96,Venture capital funds can be an important instrument for promoting growth of new firms and technologies which often involve high risk.
9267,1995-96,"The tax laws of many countries allow income of such funds to be exempt from taxation in the hands of the fund but tax it, after distribution, in the hands of the shareholders."
9268,1995-96,"In order to encourage the formation of venture capital funds on similar lines in India, I propose to exempt from tax, income by way of dividend and long term capital gains from equity investments made by approved venture capital funds or venture capital companies."
9269,1995-96,Such venture capital funds will be required to invest only in unlisted companies engaged in manufacturing.
9270,1995-96,"Income will, however, be fully taxable in the hands of the shareholders."
9271,1995-96,"On Independence Day, 1994, the Prime Minister had announced the launching of the Integrated Urban Poverty Eradication Programme."
9272,1995-96,"Under this programme, the Ministry of Urban Development is setting up a National Urban Poverty Eradication Fund NUPEF."
9273,1995-96,I propose to allow 100% deduction from income in respect of contributions made to this fund.
9274,1995-96,"Under section 80U of the Incometax Act, a separate deduction of Rs 20,000 is allowed from the total income of handicapped persons."
9275,1995-96,I have received several representations from handicapped persons and welfare organisations stating that these individuals need additional relief on account of increased cost of medicines and living aids.
9276,1995-96,"Recognising their needs, I propose to raise the level of deduction for handicapped persons from Rs 20,000 at present to Rs 40,000."
9277,1995-96,"Many voluntary relief organisations have represented that the parents or guardians of children with severe disability, such as spastic children, face great mental agony having to worry about the burden of providing for the maintenance of the disabled after the death of the parents or the guardian."
9278,1995-96,I see merit in this representation.
9279,1995-96,"I, therefore, propose to allow a new deduction of upto Rs  20,000, from the taxable income of parents or guardians of handicapped children provided this amount is deposited in any approved scheme of LIC, UTI etc. for providing recurring or lump sum payment for the maintenance and upkeep of a handicapped dependant after the death of parents or the guardian."
9280,1995-96,A number of funds have been established by trade unions for the 14 welfare of the employees and their dependants.
9281,1995-96,"These funds are used to provide cash benefits in the event of superannuation, illness or death or to meet the cost of education of the employees’ children."
9282,1995-96,I propose to exempt the income of such funds from income tax.
9283,1995-96,"The National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation has been set up in pursuance of the announcement made by the Prime Minister on Independence Day, 1993."
9284,1995-96,The main object of the Corporation is to promote economic and developmental activities for the benefit of the members of the minority communities.
9285,1995-96,I propose to exempt from income tax the income of this corporation as well as of similar corporations established by any State Government.
9286,1995-96,"I also propose to allow deduction in respect of donations made to these corporations, under section 80G of the Incometax Act ."
9287,1995-96,Upgradation of human resources is a high priority.
9288,1995-96,The fundamental need is for improvement of primary and adult education in rural and semiurban areas where facilities for such education are deficient.
9289,1995-96,"In addition to public funding, we have to encourage private contributions for this purpose."
9290,1995-96,"In 1993, I had extended the benefit of 100% deduction from taxable income for donations to universities and educational institutions of national eminence."
9291,1995-96,"This year, I propose to extend 100% deduction for donations to Zila Saksharta Samitis constituted in the districts for the promotion of elementary education."
9292,1995-96,This measure will help to mobilise additional resources for elementary and adult education in rural and semiurban areas and enable us to intensify our total literacy campaign.
9293,1995-96,"All over the world, revenue administrations widen the tax base by enlarging the scope of deduction of tax at source."
9294,1995-96,This brings in more persons into the tax net and assists the transition to lower rates of taxation.
9295,1995-96,It also helps in the reporting of correct incomes.
9296,1995-96,"In many countries, income from professional and technical services is subject to deduction of tax at source."
9297,1995-96,"In order to prevent underreporting of income in this sector, I propose to introduce a new provision in the Incometax Act subjecting the sums payable by way of fees for professional or technical services to the requirement of deduction of incometax at source at the rate of 10 per cent."
9298,1995-96,"There will be no deduction of tax at source where the aggregate of payments or credits during the financial year is below Rs 20,000 or where payments are made by individuals and HUFs."
9299,1995-96,"Tax is deducted at source on payments made in excess of Rs  10,000, to contractors under section 194C of the Incometax Act."
9300,1995-96,"Legal disputes have arisen whether the TDS provisions will apply to transport contracts, advertisement contracts, broadcasting contracts, telecasting contracts and catering contracts."
9301,1995-96,"To avoid further litigation and check tax avoidance, I propose to provide for deduction of tax at source in these cases at the existing rate of 2 per cent for the main contract and 1 per cent for subcontracts."
9302,1995-96,"Taking into account the inflation over the years, I also propose to raise the limit below which deduction at source is not necessary from Rs 10,000 at present to Rs 20,000."
9303,1995-96,"The income from units of mutual funds or of the Unit Trust of India, though liable to incometax, is not subject to deduction of tax at source in most cases."
9304,1995-96,This has led to nonreporting or underreporting of such income.
9305,1995-96,In order to prevent misuse and ensure a uniformity of treatment with other financial instruments 15
9306,1995-96,I propose to provide for deduction of tax at source from such incomes at the rate of 20 per cent in the case of companies and at the rate of 15 per cent for all others including individuals and HUFs.
9307,1995-96,There will be no change in the present tax treatment of nonresidents or offshore funds.
9308,1995-96,"In the case of resident unitholders, deduction of tax at source will be made only if the aggregate amount of income payable under each scheme during a financial year exceeds Rs 10,000."
9309,1995-96,No deduction of tax at source will be required where units have been issued under an existing scheme which provides for payment of a fixed amount after a certain period of time or where postdated cheques have already been issued towards payment of income.
9310,1995-96,I also propose to provide for deduction of incometax at source from interest on time deposits with banks at the rate of 20 per cent plus surcharge in the case of domestic companies and 10 per cent in the case of individuals and other noncorporate entities.
9311,1995-96,"The new provision will be applicable only to the deposits made on or after 1st July, 1995."
9312,1995-96,"No tax shall be deducted if the amount of interest credited or paid during a financial year is Rs 10,000 or less branchwise."
9313,1995-96,"Thus, persons having small deposits will not be affected by the requirement of deduction of tax."
9314,1995-96,"The existing facility of nondeduction of tax, where the recipient of interest has no taxable income will also be available."
9315,1995-96,"Interest on time deposits with primary cooperative credit societies, cooperative land mortgage banks and cooperative land development banks will be outside the scope of this provision."
9316,1995-96,"Chapter XX C of the Incometax Act empowers the Central Government to make preemptive purchase of immovable properties, beyond a prescribed limit, which, at present, is Rs 10 lakhs."
9317,1995-96,A single monetary limit for all the notified cities needs to be revised in the context of local variations in real estate prices.
9318,1995-96,"I, therefore, propose to make a provision for prescribing different monetary limits for different cities."
9319,1995-96,Hon’ble Members are aware that the searches conducted by the Income Tax Department are an important means of unearthing black money.
9320,1995-96,"However, undisclosed incomes have to be related to the different years in which the income was earned and as such assessments are unduly delayed."
9321,1995-96,"In order to make the procedure more effective, I am proposing a new scheme under which undisclosed income detected as a result of search shall be assessed separately at a flat rate of 60 per cent."
9322,1995-96,An appeal against the order can be filed directly before the IncomeTax Appellate Tribunal.
9323,1995-96,"In allowing deduction for depreciation, 100 per cent deduction is allowed in the year of purchase for individual items of machinery or plant the value of which does not exceed Rs 5,000, The written down value of such assets is thereafter taken as nil."
9324,1995-96,This provision was introduced as difficulties were experienced in keeping record of items of small value for purposes of allowance of depreciation.
9325,1995-96,"After switching over to the concept of block of assets with effect from 1st April, 1988, all the items of plant and machinery falling in a block are pooled together for allowing depreciation at the prescribed rates."
9326,1995-96,"There is, therefore, no justification for the continuance of this provision."
9327,1995-96,"I, accordingly, propose to provide that even items of machinery or plant costing less than Rs  5,000 will form part of a ‘block of assets’ and depreciation will be allowed on the same at the rate specified in the Incometax Rules."
9328,1995-96,I propose to amend the provisions of the Incometax Act to provide that the taxable income may be computed only on cash or mercantile basis.
9329,1995-96,It is also being provided that the taxpayers shall follow accounting standards as may be notified by the Central Government from time to time for various businesses.
9330,1995-96,"This provision is being made applicable from accounting year starting from 1st April,1996."
9331,1995-96,The calculation of capital gains on sale of bonus shares has led to several disputes.
9332,1995-96,"In order to simplify the position and avoid disputes, I propose that the cost of bonus shares for calculating the capital gains tax shall be taken at nil."
9333,1995-96,I now turn to my proposals regarding indirect taxes.
9334,1995-96,"The thrust of my proposals is to continue the strategy of tax reform we have followed and reduce the cost of inputs to Indian producers, simplify the tax structure, minimize anomalies, promote competition and efficiency, lower prices paid by Indian consumers and thereby check the potential for inflation."
9335,1995-96,I shall deal first with import duties.
9336,1995-96,"The present peak rate of import duty of 65% is still very high compared to other developing countries, let alone industrialised nations."
9337,1995-96,I propose to continue the process of phased reduction in the peak rate by lowering it to 50%.
9338,1995-96,"The machinery and capital goods sector is a critical sector of our industry and it has responded extremely well to the new policies with a growth of 25% in AprilNovember, 1994."
9339,1995-96,"I propose a package of measures which will further rationalise and simplify the import duty structure as applicable to machinery and capital goods, remove a number of anomalies and assist the industry in achieving a high rate of growth."
9340,1995-96,At present the general import duty rate on machinery items is 25% but certain capital goods like generating sets and weighing machinery attract higher rate of duty.
9341,1995-96,I am proposing to bring down the duty on these items also to 25%. ·
9342,1995-96,"The rate of import duty on machine tools, currently varies between 35% and 45%."
9343,1995-96,I propose to unify the duty rates at 25% which is the general rate for machinery.
9344,1995-96,Parts of such machine tools will also generally attract duty of 25%. ·
9345,1995-96,"Components of capital goods generally attract an import duty of 25% but components which contain electronic parts and components which are interchangeable with motor vehicle parts, attract higher rates."
9346,1995-96,I propose to reduce the duty rate on these components to 25%.
9347,1995-96,Quality control is a must for manufacturing industries if they have to improve the quality of their products.
9348,1995-96,"I am proposing to reduce the import duty on testing, quality control and other instruments from present rates varying from 40% to 60% to a uniform level of 25%."
9349,1995-96,Parts of such instruments in general will also attract the same rate.
9350,1995-96,"These proposals will unify the customs duty rates for nearly 80% of general machinery both mechanical and electrical, machine tools, instruments 17 and projects at 25%."
9351,1995-96,"They will avoid anomalies relating to parts and components, reduce classification disputes and promote investment by reducing its cost."
9352,1995-96,"Metals, ferrous and nonferrous, are key inputs into capital goods and many other lines of production, many of which are undertaken by small scale producers."
9353,1995-96,These items at present attract rates of duty varying from 50% to 60%.
9354,1995-96,"Ideally, such materials should not attract rates of duty higher than those on the capital goods."
9355,1995-96,"But keeping in view the need to allow domestic producers of metals a reasonable transition period, I am proposing to reduce the import duty rates on ferrous and nonferrous metals to 40%."
9356,1995-96,"For unwrought nonferrous metals like copper, zinc and lead, the import duty is proposed to be reduced to 35%."
9357,1995-96,"Import duty on hot rolled coils of iron and steel for rerolling is proposed to be reduced from 40% to 30%, and that on stainless steel scrap from 30% to 20%."
9358,1995-96,Import duty on sponge iron is proposed to be reduced from 30% to 20%.
9359,1995-96,I also propose to reduce the import duty on a number of nonmetallic minerals from 65% to 30%.
9360,1995-96,"I am also simplifying the import duty structure on ball or roller bearings which currently attract different rates of duty depending on size, weight and description."
9361,1995-96,Henceforth all ball or roller bearings will attract a uniform duty of 25% +
9362,1995-96,Rs  120/kg.
9363,1995-96,The revised duty structure is likely to reduce the incentive for under invoicing and smuggling.
9364,1995-96,Clothing and textiles are items of mass consumption.
9365,1995-96,"Yet our import duties on raw materials and inputs used to manufacture synthetic yarns, fibres and fabrics are on the high side."
9366,1995-96,"In view of this, and keeping in mind the continuing inflationary pressure in this sensitive area, I propose to reduce import duty on xylenes from 30% to 10% to lower the cost of manufacturing DMT/PTA."
9367,1995-96,"I am also proposing to reduce the import duty on DMT, PTA and MEG, being essential raw materials for the manufacture of polyester fibre and polyester filament yarn, from 60% to 35%."
9368,1995-96,"On caprolactum, a basic raw material for nylon, the import duty is proposed to be reduced from 60% to 45%."
9369,1995-96,These changes should substantially reduce input costs to the user industries.
9370,1995-96,"To help ensure that the benefits are reflected in the prices of the final products, I also propose to reduce the import duty on synthetic fibres and filament yarns to 45% ad valorem. 83."
9371,1995-96,I am also proposing to reduce the import duty on certain chemicals widely used in industry.
9372,1995-96,"On basic feed stocks like ethylene and benzene, the import duty is being reduced from 15% to 10%."
9373,1995-96,"On soda ash, caustic soda and linear alkyl benzene, the import duty is being reduced from 65% to 40%."
9374,1995-96,"On certain chemical intermediates like acrylonitrile, the import duty is being reduced from 30% to 20%."
9375,1995-96,I am proposing to reduce the import duty on molasses from 65% to 10% to help the alcohol based chemical industries.
9376,1995-96,The duty on LPG is also being reduced from 15% to 10%.
9377,1995-96,"Electronics is a fast growing industry offering great promise for exports, employment and development in the small scale sector."
9378,1995-96,"In my last budget, I had conducted a major restructuring of duties to promote growth of this industry."
9379,1995-96,"As a further step in this direction, I propose to reduce the import duty on specified raw materials and piece parts from the present levels of 20% and 30% to a uniform level of 15%, on electronic components including printed circuit boards and colour monitor tubes from 40% to 25%, on populated printed circuit boards from 50% 18 and 65% to 35% and on computers, from 65% to 40%."
9380,1995-96,I am also proposing to reduce the import duty on integrated circuits and hard disc drives to 25% which is likely to reduce the grey market in these products.
9381,1995-96,Import duty on picture tubes for colour TVs is being reduced from 65% to 40%.
9382,1995-96,"To give a boost to the telecom optical fibre cable industry, I propose to reduce the import duty on optical fibres from 40% to 35%."
9383,1995-96,I am also proposing to reduce the import duty on both systems and application software to a uniform level of 10% only.
9384,1995-96,"With these changes in duty structure, I expect this industry to show even more dynamism in future."
9385,1995-96,"For promoting healthcare, last year I had simplified the import duty structure on medical equipment, exempted many types of life saving equipment from payment of duty, and abolished the certification procedure for availing of the exemption for charitable hospitals."
9386,1995-96,"In order to help manufacture and maintenance of medical equipment, I am extending the benefit of full exemption from import duty to all parts of exempted life saving and sight saving equipment ."
9387,1995-96,Some crucial spare parts of other dutiable medical equipment such as populated PCB will attract an import duty of 15%.
9388,1995-96,"I am also proposing to fully exempt linear accelerators, which are vital for the treatment of cancer patients."
9389,1995-96,There are also proposals for reduction of import duty on a large number of drug intermediates from 50% to 40%.
9390,1995-96,Our printing industry needs quality paper so as to establish a foothold in the international field.
9391,1995-96,"With this in view, I am proposing to reduce the import duty on paper from 65% to 40%."
9392,1995-96,"To promote exports of finished leather and make it more competitive, I propose to abolish the export duty on finished leather."
9393,1995-96,Agriculture is the lynchpin of our economy and employs two thirds of our labour force.
9394,1995-96,"In order to help agriculture and allied sectors directly, I propose reducing import duties on certain items."
9395,1995-96,I am proposing to reduce the import duty on grand parent poultry stock from 30% to 20%.
9396,1995-96,"On certain drugs used as feed mix for poultry, the duty is being reduced from 65% to 15%."
9397,1995-96,"For the fishing industry, I propose to reduce the import duty on certain vaccines, prawn feed mix and preparations for prawn processing from 65% to 15%."
9398,1995-96,Agriculture and allied sectors will also be helped by the general reduction in import duties on general machinery and components.
9399,1995-96,"I have, however, proposed an increase in import duty on malt and starch from 10% to 30%, that on silk cocoon from 30% to 40% and on oleopine resins from 10% to 20% in order to give necessary protection to these sectors."
9400,1995-96,I propose to raise the free baggage allowance for passengers coming to India from Rs  4000 to Rs 6000.
9401,1995-96,"Beyond this limit, the duty rate now is 100% which I propose to reduce to 80%."
9402,1995-96,I hope this will provide welcome relief to our people working abroad and to travellers in general.
9403,1995-96,"At present import of goods through a courier attracts import duty at the rate of 100% upto Rs 10,000/and 200% thereafter."
9404,1995-96,There has been a long standing demand from industry that goods imported through a courier should be charged at the relevant rate for the item being imported.
9405,1995-96,I am making a provision to this effect in the Finance Bill.
9406,1995-96,"Pending passage of the Legislation, I am proposing that goods imported by a courier will attract a duty of 80% without any value limit."
9407,1995-96,I now turn to my proposals for excise duties.
9408,1995-96,"In my earlier budgets, I had exempted from excise duty a large number of items of common consumption like processed food, dairy products, jam, jelly, butter, cheese, tea and coffee."
9409,1995-96,"Many other items of mass consumption like cooking oil, bicycles and their tyres, kerosene stoves, bread, spices and household utensils are also exempt from excise duty."
9410,1995-96,My proposals in this budget will further reduce the burden of excise duties on articles which are widely consumed.
9411,1995-96,A number of articles of mass use are made of plastics.
9412,1995-96,Plastics are also finding increasing use in agriculture and agroprocessing.
9413,1995-96,The present rate of duty on this basic material is 30%.
9414,1995-96,I propose to bring down the rate of duty on plastics to 25%.
9415,1995-96,"On the dutiable articles made from plastics also, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 25%."
9416,1995-96,"However, articles of plastics which are exempt at present will continue to be so."
9417,1995-96,These measures are being combined with a reduction in the import duty on bulk plastics from rates varying between 45% and 65% to a uniform rate of 40%.
9418,1995-96,"At present, we have a uniform excise duty of 15% on all metals except aluminum."
9419,1995-96,I now propose to reduce the excise duty on aluminum also from 20% to 15%.
9420,1995-96,"In order to remove areas of dispute in classification and to rationalise the duty structure, I propose a uniform excise duty of 15% on parts of capital goods as against present rates which vary from 10% to 25%."
9421,1995-96,This will avoid disputes as to whether a particular item should be considered as an article of metal or component of a machinery.
9422,1995-96,I am also proposing a concessional rate of excise duty of 10% on glassware produced by the labour intensive mouth blown process as against the present rate of 20%.
9423,1995-96,Many Honourable Members of Parliament have suggested that there are certain sectors of the industry which are both highly labour intensive and belong to the unorganised sector and that they deserve complete exemption from excise duty.
9424,1995-96,"Having regard to these requests, I propose to exempt the following from excise duty:      97."
9425,1995-96,"As part of the process of reducing higher end duty rates, I am proposing excise duty: on aerated water from 50% to 40%;  on  on  on  on 20 air conditioning machinery from 60% to 40%; cosmetics from 50% to 40%;glazed tiles from 40% to 30%.perfumed antiseptic cream from 30% to 20%."
9426,1995-96,The rate is still high but revenue constraints rule out any further reduction for the present.
9427,1995-96,"The concurrent reduction in import duties, indicated earlier, will help ensure that the benefit of excise duty reduction is passed on to consumers."
9428,1995-96,The textured polyester yarn industry has complained about the burden of excise duty of 69% on the value addition in their industry.
9429,1995-96,I am proposing suitable adjustment in the tariff value of textured yarn so as to reduce the total duty burden at the texturising stage from Rs  10.35/kg to Rs 4.60/kg.
9430,1995-96,"On sewing thread which currently attracts excise duty at rates varying from 23% to 69%, I am proposing a uniform duty of 23%."
9431,1995-96,I have some proposals which are in the nature of antievasion measures.
9432,1995-96,I am proposing an excise duty of 10% on wool tops so as to check evasion of excise duty at the woollen yarn stage.
9433,1995-96,"As full Modvat credit will be available, the tax will fall only on those who are evading excise duty at the yarn stage."
9434,1995-96,I am also proposing a minimum excise duty of Rs  10 per kilo on waste and scrap of fibre and yarn so as to discourage the tendency to clear good quality fibre and yarn in the guise of waste.
9435,1995-96,It is also being clarified that yarn made predominantly from synthetic waste will attract the same rate of duty as yarn made from staple fibre.
9436,1995-96,Insulated wires and cables attract a duty of 30%.
9437,1995-96,"As these have wide household and industrial application, I am proposing to reduce the duty to 25%."
9438,1995-96,I propose to reduce the excise duty on polyester filament yarn from 21 103.
9439,1995-96,There is a persistent demand from the plastic woven bags manufacturers for extending Modvat to the users of such bags.
9440,1995-96,I am now proposing that users of such plastic bags as well as jute bags be allowed full credit of excise duty paid on such bags.
9441,1995-96,Cement industry is one of the major consumers of such bags.
9442,1995-96,I am simultaneously proposing a modest increase in excise duty on cement from Rs 330 to Rs 350/MT for integrated cement plants and Rs  185 to Rs  200/MT for mini cement plants.
9443,1995-96,"For the mini cement plants using vertical shaft kilns, the daily clearance limit is also being raised from 200 to 300 MT per day."
9444,1995-96,Certain items of china and porcelain ware attract a duty of 30% which is on the high side for a product which is increasingly of common use.
9445,1995-96,"With a view to giving relief to the consumers, I am proposing to reduce the duty to 15%."
9446,1995-96,Small scale units play a significant role in the economy of the country.
9447,1995-96,"Currently, only units whose turnover of dutiable goods did not exceed Rs  2 crore in the preceding financial year are eligible for the concessional rates of excise duty under the general small scale industry exemption scheme."
9448,1995-96,I have received representations that the present limit of Rs  2 crore is too low and that it acts as a disincentive to future growth.
9449,1995-96,I am thus proposing to raise the eligibility limit for availing of the SSI exemption scheme to Rs  3 crore.
9450,1995-96,There has been a perpetual problem with manufacturers of exempted goods as they may have to pay excise duty on waste and scrap generated during the process of manufacture.
9451,1995-96,It does not seem very logical to bring these units under the excise control only for the purpose of charging duty on such waste and scrap.
9452,1995-96,I am thus proposing to fully exempt waste and scrap which arise in the manufacture of exempted goods.
9453,1995-96,This should help a large number of units in the small scale sector.
9454,1995-96,I am also proposing abolition of the system of filing of classification lists.
9455,1995-96,"From 1st May, 1995, the manufacturers need not file any classification list before clearing goods from the factory."
9456,1995-96,There have been requests from trade and industry for liberalisation and simplification of Modvat scheme.
9457,1995-96,"With this end in view, I am proposing the following relaxations in the Modvat Rules  Allowing Modvat credit for specified quality control, testing, pollution control and R&D equipment;  Utilisation of Modvat credit for payment of duty on any goods notified under the Modvat scheme;  Allowing Modvat credit for furnace oil and low sulphur heavy stock used for generation of power in a factory manufacturing excisable goods."
9458,1995-96,I am also proposing to extend Modvat for tyre yarn used in tyres by imposing a duty of 20% on the intermediate tyre cord fabrics.
9459,1995-96,"To make up for the revenue loss, the specific rates of duty on tyres are being raised by about 8%."
9460,1995-96,"Excise duty on tyres for two wheeled and three wheeled vehicles is, however, not being raised."
9461,1995-96,I am proposing extension of Modvat scheme to industrial fabrics.
9462,1995-96,"In the case of woollen fabrics also, I am proposing to extend Modvat fully, as such fabrics already attract basic excise duty and enjoy limited Modvat facilities."
9463,1995-96,I am also proposing to broadly align the Central Excise Tariff on textiles on the lines of the harmonised system of nomenclature.
9464,1995-96,This will help reduce classification disputes.
9465,1995-96,"Consonant with the increase in prices, I am proposing an increase in the existing specific rates of duty on cigarettes by about 7%."
9466,1995-96,"I have also proposed certain amendments in the Finance Bill seeking to effect changes in the Customs Act, the Central Excises and Salt Act and excise and customs tariffs."
9467,1995-96,These include certain consequential amendments to the customs tariff based on the amendments to the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System which has been adopted by our country in terms of International Convention on the Harmonised System.
9468,1995-96,The amendments are merely enabling provisions and do not have significant revenue implications.
9469,1995-96,"In order to save the time of the House, I do not propose to recount them."
9470,1995-96,The increases in excise duties are expected to lead to a revenue gain of Rs  335 crore while the reliefs will amount to Rs  646 crore in a full year.
9471,1995-96,"Of the total net loss of Rs  311 crore, the loss to the Centre will be Rs 203 crore and that to the States Rs 108 crore."
9472,1995-96,"On the customs side, the proposals would result in a revenue loss of Rs  1179 crore."
9473,1995-96,"Applying conventional methods of estimation, the proposed changes in direct taxes are expected to lead to a revenue loss of about Rs 900 crore on account of Income tax, of which the loss to the States would be about Rs 700 crore."
9474,1995-96,Total net loss to the Centre would thus be Rs  1582 crore.
9475,1995-96,"These methods do not take adequate account of the gains from simplification, rationalisation and improved tax compliance."
9476,1995-96,"Last year, the net loss from the revenue proposals on the basis of conventional estimates was placed at more than Rs  4000 crore."
9477,1995-96,"However, I had predicted that because of gains from compliance and better administration our revenues would not suffer any loss."
9478,1995-96,This optimism has been fully justified by performance as indicated in the Revised Estimates for 199495.
9479,1995-96,The tax changes I have proposed in the budget are essentially a continuation of the efforts made in the previous year and I am confident that the gains from the reform will ensure that there will be no revenue loss.
9480,1995-96,"I am not, therefore, assuming any revenue losses from my Budget proposals."
9481,1995-96,Hence the fiscal deficit will remain at 5.5% of GDP.
9482,1995-96,Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in customs and excise duties will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
9483,1995-96,"Honourable members may recall that in my first Budget Speech, I had affirmed that no power on earth could stop an idea whose time had come."
9484,1995-96,I had also stated that the emergence of India as a major economic power was such an idea.
9485,1995-96,"It is this vision, of a resurgent India, taking her rightful place as an economic power house in Asia, which has inspired our economic policies."
9486,1995-96,"Our Government has worked hard to convert this vision into a reality, and I think the House will agree with me that our efforts have met with considerable success."
9487,1995-96,We have sought to mobilise the collective will of our people for development through an action programme which commits us to the twin pursuit of excellence and social justice.
9488,1995-96,There is no parallel example in the world of a country of India’s size and diversity seeking to bring about a massive social and economic transformation in the framework of a democratic polity and an open society committed to the rule of law and individual freedom.
9489,1995-96,"India’s experience is, therefore, of great worldwide 23 significance."
9490,1995-96,The world is certainly watching us with interest and expectation.
9491,1995-96,"As I see it, India is on the threshold of unprecedented opportunities provided we have the wisdom to seize them."
9492,1995-96,We have made a good beginning but there is still a vast unfinished agenda.
9493,1995-96,We have to persevere in our efforts.
9494,1995-96,This will call for hard work and dedication and a measure of selfdiscipline on the part of all sections of society.
9495,1995-96,We must never forget that a higher standard of living for our people can become a reality only through an all round increase in productivity.
9496,1995-96,Clearly there are no short cuts to it.
9497,1995-96,We cannot simply spend our way into prosperity.
9498,1995-96,Those of us in politics have a special responsibility.
9499,1995-96,The pursuit of competitive politics must not be allowed to distract our people’s attention from the basic task of nation building.
9500,1995-96,"Politics in this country must recapture the spirit of idealism and self sacrifice, which inspired our freedom struggle, and become a purposeful instrument of social change."
9501,1995-96,This then is no time for rest or to fritter away our energies in partisan strife.
9502,1995-96,"It is a time for rededication and reaffirmation of our collective solemn resolve to work tirelessly for building a new India worthy of the dreams of the founding fathers of our Republic, an India which will enable our children and grand children to lead a life of dignity and self respect, to take pride in being Indian and to grapple effectively with the challenges of the twentyfirst century."
9503,1995-96,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words I commend this Budget to this august House."
9504,1996-97,I rise to present the regular budget for the year 199697.
9505,1996-97,It was the duty of every political party to be faithful to that mandate.
9506,1996-97,"Accordingly, political parties of different complexions and different ideologies have come together to form this government."
9507,1996-97,"Many of them are regional parties, albeit with a national outlook."
9508,1996-97,What has united us is a resolve to preserve India’s secular heritage and to provide a representative government committed to faster economic growth and enhanced social justice.
9509,1996-97,The United Front is a coalition.
9510,1996-97,"Before assuming office, the partners of the coalition finalised a document called “A Common Approach to Major Policy Matters and a Minimum Programme”, popularly called the CMP."
9511,1996-97,"This historic document was released to the nation by our Prime Minister, Shri Deve Gowda, on June 4, 1996."
9512,1996-97,When I began work on the CMP I was not even a Minister.
9513,1996-97,When we completed our exercise I found myself in the office of Finance Minister.
9514,1996-97,"Therefore, my commitment to the CMP goes beyond the office I hold."
9515,1996-97,Hon’ble Members will have many opportunities this afternoon to test my commitment and they will find that the CMP has provided the foundation and set the agenda for this Budget.
9516,1996-97,An Update of the Economic Survey 199596 was laid on the Table of the House last Friday.
9517,1996-97,It is a slim document of no more than 21 pages and I hope it made for good weekend reading.
9518,1996-97,Our conclusions are that the economic indicators point to high growth but there are significant areas of weakness.
9519,1996-97,"The Update has identified these areas as the fiscal deficit, sluggish agricultural growth, inadequate infrastructure, high interest rates and the trade deficit."
9520,1996-97,The most worrisome is the decline in the growth of agricultural crop production to 0.9 per cent in 199596.
9521,1996-97,"The Update has also listed fiscal challenge, infrastructure challenge and employment 1 199697 2 and poverty alleviation as key issues which need to be addressed on a priority basis."
9522,1996-97,The CMP has declared that the government will follow economic policies that will promote growth with social justice and lead to greater selfreliance.
9523,1996-97,We have no use for jobless growth; nor for growth that leaves untouched large sections of the people.
9524,1996-97,We will remove controls and regulations over agriculture and industry.
9525,1996-97,We will keep our economy open and competitive in order to encourage more foreign trade and attract more foreign investment.
9526,1996-97,We will reform the tax system.
9527,1996-97,We will broaden and deepen reforms of the financial and capital markets even while strengthening independent regulators like the Reserve Bank of India RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI.
9528,1996-97,"Above all, we will observe fiscal and monetary prudence which is the key to low inflation and rapid growth."
9529,1996-97,"This Budget, therefore, has seven broad objectives: · To remain steadfast on the course of economic reforms and liberalisation aimed at accelerating economic growth."
9530,1996-97,"To ensure broadbased growth in agriculture, industry and services to achieve high employment."
9531,1996-97,To strengthen key interventions to promote human development.
9532,1996-97,To ensure viability in the balance of payments through strong export performance and larger foreign investment flows.
9533,1996-97,I shall now deal with the major areas of the economy and spell out our policy initiatives in order to achieve the objectives that I have just listed.
9534,1996-97,Agriculture & Rural Credit 7.
9535,1996-97,"The Common Minimum Programme lays emphasis on broadbased agricultural development and calls for a doubling of the flow of credit to agriculture and agro industries, particularly to small and marginal farmers, within five years."
9536,1996-97,We have evolved an integrated plan consisting of several elements for fulfilling this important objective.
9537,1996-97,"First, the share capital of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD will be increased from the present level of Rs 500 crore to Rs 2,000 crore in the next five years."
9538,1996-97,"I propose to double NABARD’s paid up share capital to Rs 1,000 crore in the current year."
9539,1996-97,A budgetary provision of Rs 100 crore is being made towards the Government of India’s share and the balance Rs 400 crore will be contributed by the Reserve Bank of India.
9540,1996-97,"Second, the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF which is operated by NABARD and funded by contributions from commercial banks falling short of their priority lending targets will be augmented considerably."
9541,1996-97,"The RIDF provides 3 loans to State governments for completion of projects in areas like medium and minor irrigation, soil conservation and watershed management."
9542,1996-97,"During 199596, NABARD sanctioned loans aggregating Rs 1,984 crore to 19 States for completing 2,489 projects."
9543,1996-97,"During the current financial year, an additional Rs 2,500 crore will be made available for financing rural infrastructure through the RIDF."
9544,1996-97,"In addition to the RIDF, I am proposing an Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme under which the Centre will provide, on a matching basis, additional Central assistance by way of loans to the States for the timely completion of selected large irrigation and multipurpose projects."
9545,1996-97,"I am making an allocation of Rs 800 crore in 199697 to launch this scheme which is designed to accelerate the completion of irrigation projects where the project cost exceeds Rs 1,000 crore and is beyond the resource capability of the States."
9546,1996-97,"I am also allocating Rs 100 crore in the current financial year for irrigation projects where, with just a little additional resources, the projects could be completed and farmers could get the benefit of assured water supply."
9547,1996-97,"Details of the large projects and the projects to benefit 100,000 hectares will be announced by the Planning Commission in the next few days."
9548,1996-97,This programme will be closely monitored by the Department of Programme Implementation.
9549,1996-97,"Fourth, to promote investment in commercial or high technology agriculture and allied activities such as horticulture, floriculture and agroprocessing, state level agricultural development finance institutions are proposed to be set up."
9550,1996-97,NABARD will be the chief promoter.
9551,1996-97,Other national level financial institutions as well as the State governments concerned will be requested to participate in the equity.
9552,1996-97,"Fifth, it has been agreed with RBI to promote the setting up of new private local area banks with jurisdiction over two or three contiguous districts."
9553,1996-97,"This would enable the mobilisation of rural savings by local institutions and, at the same time, make them available for investments in the local areas."
9554,1996-97,"Finally, we have taken a number of decisions that will directly benefit the farmers."
9555,1996-97,"Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister announced increases in the subsidies for phosphatic and potassic fertilisers."
9556,1996-97,"Government have decided to extend the subsidy under the Integrated Cereal Development  Rice Programme to power tillers at the rate of Rs 30,000 or 50% of the cost for each power tiller."
9557,1996-97,"The subsidy scheme on small tractors at the rate of Rs 30,000 per tractor is presently restricted to small and marginal farmers."
9558,1996-97,I am extending this scheme to all farmers.
9559,1996-97,"I am also enhancing the subsidy on sprinkler and drip irrigation from 50% to 70% of the cost of the system and the ceiling is also being raised from Rs  15,000 to Rs 25,000 per hectare."
9560,1996-97,"In respect of small and marginal farmers, women and scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, this limit is being raised to 90% of the cost of the system."
9561,1996-97,"One of the first acts of the Prime Minister, Shri Deve Gowda, was to convene a meeting of Chief Ministers on Basic Minimum Services."
9562,1996-97,"This reflects the resolve of the United Front to “advance the principles of political, administrative and economic federalism”."
9563,1996-97,The Chief Ministers’ Conference recommended adoption 4 of seven objectives to be attained by the year 2000.
9564,1996-97,These are 100% coverage of provision of safe drinking water; 100% coverage of primary health centres; universalisation of primary education; public housing assistance to all shelterless poor families; extension of the midday meal scheme; road connectivity to all villages and habitations; and streamlining the public distribution system targeted to families below the poverty line.
9565,1996-97,These objectives are now being served by Centrallysponsored schemes and schemes in State Plans.
9566,1996-97,"Hon’ble Members will be glad to know that I am providing an additional amount of Rs 2,466 crore as Central assistance for State and UT plans to significantly increase the availability of funds for these schemes."
9567,1996-97,"From this amount, it is our intention to allocate about Rs 250 crore to provide shelter and other basic amenities to slum dwellers."
9568,1996-97,The distribution of this enhanced allocation across the seven schemes and across States and Union Territories will be determined by the Planning Commission in consultation with them.
9569,1996-97,The Update of the Economic Survey has highlighted the enormous challenge on the infrastructure front.
9570,1996-97,The state of our infrastructure  particularly power and roads  is very poor.
9571,1996-97,We cannot sustain a 7 per cent growth unless we can revitalise these infrastructure sectors.
9572,1996-97,"Huge funds are also required for telecom, railways and ports."
9573,1996-97,"Infrastructure needs longterm finance, typically 1520 year financial instruments."
9574,1996-97,"However, it has not been possible to float such instruments in the Indian market so far."
9575,1996-97,"Hence, I am proposing the establishment of an Infrastructure Development Finance Company IDFC."
9576,1996-97,"This company will be incorporated with an authorised share capital of Rs 5,000 crore."
9577,1996-97,"The Central government, the RBI, banks and financial institutions will contribute to the share capital."
9578,1996-97,I am making a budgetary provision of Rs 500 crore in the current financial year as the contribution of the Central government.
9579,1996-97,The RBI’s initial contribution to the share capital will also be Rs 500 crore.
9580,1996-97,"Among other things, the IDFC will act as a direct lender, as a refinancing institution and as a provider of financial guarantees."
9581,1996-97,"I believe that the IDFC will induce investors, both Indian and foreign, to make available long term funds at the lowest possible market rates."
9582,1996-97,I am also proposing some tax incentives for infrastructure investment which I shall outline later.
9583,1996-97,Hon’ble Members are aware that the Central government has already set up the National Highway Authority of India.
9584,1996-97,We need a worldclass national highway system in place very quickly.
9585,1996-97,I have decided to provide a sum of Rs 200 crore to strengthen the capital base of the National Highway Authority of India.
9586,1996-97,The Authority will now be in a position to leverage resources for highway development from both within India and from outside.
9587,1996-97,Small Scale Industry 2 0 .
9588,1996-97,The entrepreneurdriven smallscale sector forms the backbone of our industry.
9589,1996-97,I am deeply committed to strengthening this sector.
9590,1996-97,The following set of measures will be put in place immediately. ·
9591,1996-97,"First, the Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI has an 5 unutilised corpus of about Rs 175 crore in its Technology Development and Modernisation Fund Scheme."
9592,1996-97,I am now proposing that SIDBI should refinance the State Financial Corporations SFCs and commercial banks for modernisation projects upto Rs 50 lakh.
9593,1996-97,This will decentralise decision making to the advantage of smallscale units seeking modernisation funds from SFCs and banks. ·
9594,1996-97,"Second, refinance is now provided for the Single Window Scheme of SFCs etc."
9595,1996-97,I am doubling this ceiling to Rs 100 lakh. ·
9596,1996-97,"Third, SIDBI will participate in venture capital funds set up by public sector institutions as well as private companies upto 50% of the total corpus of the fund, provided such a fund is dedicated to the financing of smallscale industry."
9597,1996-97,"Fourth, in order to encourage a larger number of small scale units to seek ISO 9000 certification of quality, lending institutions will be permitted to lend to the ultimate borrowers on the same terms and conditions as SIDBI’s direct lending scheme."
9598,1996-97,SIDBI will provide refinance assistance to these lending institutions.
9599,1996-97,Science and technology is the key to economic progress and prosperity.
9600,1996-97,"Indian scientists and technologists have accomplished a great deal, especially in the areas of agriculture, space, atomic energy and defence."
9601,1996-97,There is now need for a massive renewal of our science and technology infrastructure.
9602,1996-97,I propose to extend a matching onetime grant for the modernisation of the laboratories and institutes of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research CSIR and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ICAR.
9603,1996-97,I will match every commercial rupee that the CSIR and ICAR earn incrementally in the next two years with another rupee from the Budget.
9604,1996-97,I also propose to strengthen the Fund for Technology Development and Application which was created in 199495 to help indigenously developed technologies reach the stage of commercial application.
9605,1996-97,The interim Budget had provided Rs 10 crore.
9606,1996-97,"As a demonstration of this government’s commitment to science and technology, I am immediately making available Rs 30 crore."
9607,1996-97,The Department of Science & Technology will announce the constitution of the Technology Development Board shortly.
9608,1996-97,Public Distribution System 2 4 .
9609,1996-97,The Common Minimum Programme states that the Public Distribution System will be strengthened to meet the twin objectives of price stability and making available essential articles to the poor.
9610,1996-97,"It is, therefore, proposed to restructure the PDS."
9611,1996-97,A beginning will be made where the need is most acutely felt.
9612,1996-97,The restructured PDS will serve households below the poverty line.
9613,1996-97,Details of the restructured PDS are being worked out and will be announced in due course.
9614,1996-97,The Fifth Pay Commission is expected to submit its report by the end of September 1996.
9615,1996-97,Funds have been provided in this Budget as well as the Railway 6 Budget to meet the anticipated expenditure.
9616,1996-97,"Meanwhile, I am happy that the question of granting another installment of interim relief has been sorted out satisfactorily."
9617,1996-97,Other Welfare Measures 2 6 .
9618,1996-97,The Prime Minister has repeatedly declared that this government is a government of the poor and for the poor.
9619,1996-97,Growth with social justice will be the motto of this government.
9620,1996-97,"Unless the country’s GDP grows at over 7% per year in the next 10 years, we will not be able to abolish poverty and unemployment."
9621,1996-97,"However, there is a need to identify vulnerable sections of the people and help them."
9622,1996-97,The Prime Minister has identified some target groups which deserve to be helped and I am proposing some new initiatives for meeting their special needs.
9623,1996-97,"These initiatives will be implemented through the State governments and, as far as possible, in collaboration with nongovernmental organisations. · · · · · I am setting apart, initially, a sum of Rs 5 crore to assist in the establishment of oldage homes and another sum of Rs  5 crore to assist in the establishment of residential primary schools for poor children irrespective of caste or creed."
9624,1996-97,It is intended that both these programmes should be implemented through nongovernmental organisations.
9625,1996-97,The programmes will be firmed up by the Ministries concerned in consultation with the State governments.
9626,1996-97,Rs 10 crore is being provided for giving assistance to States which have or will set up Women Development Corporations.
9627,1996-97,An additional amount of Rs 10 crore has been set apart for starting trainingcumproduction centres or schemes for destitute women in different States.
9628,1996-97,I am creating a National Illness Assistance Fund with an initial corpus of Rs 5 crore.
9629,1996-97,"Besides, Rs 25 crore have been set apart for contributions to the corpus of State Illness Assistance Funds that we would encourage the State governments to establish."
9630,1996-97,These funds will be used to provide assistance to the very poor for surgery or treatment for serious illnesses requiring hospitalisation.
9631,1996-97,"Rs 5 crore is being provided to award an exgratia amount of Rs 50,000 per family to the families of lorry and bus drivers who meet with fatal accidents."
9632,1996-97,This will be implemented by the State governments on a reimbursable basis.
9633,1996-97,I am making a provision of Rs 5 crore for building residential facilities for hamals  our brothers who toil day and night.
9634,1996-97,This scheme will also be implemented by the States.
9635,1996-97,The biggest challenge that we face is the fiscal challenge.
9636,1996-97,The United Government will consider a scheme of financial assistance to States 7 Front government is committed to bringing the fiscal deficit to below 4% of GDP.
9637,1996-97,This is what the Common Minimum Programme says and this is what I intend to do over a period of time.
9638,1996-97,"One plank of the strategy is, of course, to raise more revenues."
9639,1996-97,"But without a credible public expenditure management policy, no programme of fiscal deficit reduction will be sustained."
9640,1996-97,I believe that no one is against austerity or efficiency as such.
9641,1996-97,"At the same time, I accept the position that sound expenditure management is not a mere technocratic exercise but involves issues of equity, fairness and nondiscrimination."
9642,1996-97,"In order to work out a reasonable policy in this regard, I propose to appoint a highlevel Expenditure Management and Reforms Commission comprising distinguished political leaders, economists and administrators."
9643,1996-97,This Commission will be given four months  and I hope no more to submit its recommendations on public expenditure management and control as far as the Central government is concerned.
9644,1996-97,The report will be made public immediately so that we can generate an informed public debate on an issue that has a vital bearing on our economic future.
9645,1996-97,I also propose to place before the House a discussion paper on subsidies.
9646,1996-97,"The paper will list all the subsidies, visible and hidden, so that there can be an informed debate and a consensus on the overall level of subsidies as a percentage of GDP and their appropriate targeting."
9647,1996-97,"In the meantime, I intend to be strict in matters relating to cash management, project portfolio review, adherence to budgetary ceiling and adequacy of returns from public sector enterprises."
9648,1996-97,Hon’ble Members are aware that in September 1994 an agreement was signed between the Central Government and the RBI to phase out the system of adhoc treasury bills by 199798.
9649,1996-97,The experience last year and in the current year so far has shown the difficulty of staying below the withinyear limit.
9650,1996-97,"Nevertheless, I remain convinced that the system of adhoc treasury bills must be phased out."
9651,1996-97,"However, before this can happen we need to put in place a better expenditure control mechanism."
9652,1996-97,"We also need a more transparent method of defining and reporting the true budget deficit, including all forms of monetisation."
9653,1996-97,I shall present concrete proposals in this regard at the time of presentation of next year’s budget so that RBI can have greater autonomy in formulating and implementing monetary policy.
9654,1996-97,"Insurance, Banking and the Capital Market 32."
9655,1996-97,Earlier I made a reference to insurance in the context of longterm finances.
9656,1996-97,LIC and GIC are our two premier institutions in the insurance sector.
9657,1996-97,I intend to strengthen them.
9658,1996-97,The strength of an insurer has to be measured by the range and quality of its services and products and by the number of people availing of those services and products.
9659,1996-97,I am happy to announce that I have been able to persuade LIC and GIC to offer two new services aimed at the middle class and the poor.
9660,1996-97,LIC will offer a new pension scheme called “Jeevan Suraksha”.
9661,1996-97,The details of the new scheme will be announced separately but an illustration of how the scheme will work can be given.
9662,1996-97,"A person who subscribes to the scheme at age 30 for a period of 30 years by paying just Rs 250 per month will get a life pension of Rs 3,500 per month beginning at age 60."
9663,1996-97,"In addition, that person will get 25% 8 of the commuted value of the pension  about Rs 1 lakh  immediately on retirement."
9664,1996-97,"If the insured person dies before retirement, the spouse will be paid a substantial lifelong pension."
9665,1996-97,This scheme will meet a longfelt need amongst a large number of people for economic security beyond their working life.
9666,1996-97,"To launch this personal cumfamily pension scheme, I am proposing some fiscal incentives which I shall outline later."
9667,1996-97,Medical insurance is an area where the quality of the product can be greatly improved.
9668,1996-97,"Under the existing Medicare scheme, the maximum cover available is Rs 83,000 which is further segmented into different components."
9669,1996-97,This ceiling is being enhanced to Rs 3 lakh with a single aggregate limit.
9670,1996-97,"Furthermore, the GIC will launch a new low price medicare policy appropriate to the vast majority of our people."
9671,1996-97,Jeevan is the brand name for the LIC and we respect intellectual property rights.
9672,1996-97,So we are calling this new scheme “Jan Arogya”.
9673,1996-97,The policy will provide a cover upto
9674,1996-97,"Rs 5,000 per year with an annual premium of only Rs 70."
9675,1996-97,"What is more, a family of four comprising the husband, wife and two children below the age of 25, can pay an annual premium of Rs 240 and get cover for Rs 20,000 for the family as a whole."
9676,1996-97,GIC will soon announce the details of this scheme.
9677,1996-97,I have advised LIC and GIC to introduce modern information technology in their business.
9678,1996-97,I have also asked LIC to review the premium structure based on the latest mortality tables.
9679,1996-97,"An interim, nonstatutory Insurance Regulatory Authority was set up in January 1996."
9680,1996-97,I now propose to introduce a Bill to make it a statutory body and to empower it suitably.
9681,1996-97,"When I return to the subject of insurance in the next Budget, I shall address some of the policy parameters outlined in the Common Minimum Programme, including the sequence of steps for the restructuring of the insurance industry."
9682,1996-97,Reform of the banking sector has been an integral part of the process of economic reforms.
9683,1996-97,The public sector banks have shown an improvement in profitability and capital adequacy and are taking steps to adopt improved technology.
9684,1996-97,The entry of private sector banks has added a welcome measure of competition.
9685,1996-97,"Hon’ble Members are aware that in the past three years the government provided a total of Rs 11,840 crore to recapitalise several public sector banks."
9686,1996-97,"I am happy to inform the House that three of these banks are now in a position to return part of the capital, amounting to Rs 747 crore, reflecting an improvement in their performance."
9687,1996-97,This reflow of resources will help to recapitalise some more public sector banks for which a provision of Rs 909 crore is being made in 199697.
9688,1996-97,Some of the strong public sector banks are also planning to recapitalise themselves by accessing the capital markets directly.
9689,1996-97,Hon’ble Members will be pleased to know that the State Bank of India is today a prized scrip in the market.
9690,1996-97,I am also providing Rs 200 crore in 199697 for restructuring and recapitalising the Regional Rural Banks.
9691,1996-97,The capital market has a crucial role to play in raising funds for new investment.
9692,1996-97,"Government will ensure healthy development of the capital markets through effective regulation, greater transparency and improved trading and settlement practices."
9693,1996-97,Our major stock exchanges have already introduced on line 9 electronic trading.
9694,1996-97,"The commencement of a Central Depository, which is expected in the course of this year, will be a historic further step in the modernisation of the capital markets."
9695,1996-97,The present regulations governing foreign institutional investors allow investment only in listed securities.
9696,1996-97,There is also a limit of not more than 5% for an individual FII and an aggregate of 24% for all FIIs in the stock of a listed company.
9697,1996-97,It has been represented that these limits should be liberalised.
9698,1996-97,"Besides, FIIs are unable to invest in infrastructure because most infrastructure projects are set up by new companies which are not expected to be listed for some time."
9699,1996-97,"Having regard to these representations, I propose to raise the limit of 5% for an individual FII to 10% subject, however, to the aggregate limit of 24% for all FIIs."
9700,1996-97,I also propose to allow them to invest in unlisted companies in the same manner as they are allowed to invest in listed companies.
9701,1996-97,The revised guidelines are being issued separately by SEBI.
9702,1996-97,Non Banking Finance Institutions 4 1 .
9703,1996-97,"Serious concerns have been expressed from time to time about the activities of a number of nonbanking financial institutions, both corporate and noncorporate."
9704,1996-97,"I am happy to inform the House that, in consultation with the Reserve Bank of India, we have decided to bring before this House amendments to the RBI Act to strengthen the regulatory powers over all kinds of nonbanking financial companies."
9705,1996-97,It is widely acknowledged that the Companies Act 1956 needs to be re written comprehensively.
9706,1996-97,Some work has already been done.
9707,1996-97,"I intend to constitute a small drafting team comprising persons with knowledge of law, economics and company affairs to prepare a new draft and make it ready for public debate."
9708,1996-97,"My deadline is January 1, 1997."
9709,1996-97,"In the meanwhile, I propose to introduce some urgent amendments to the present Act to provide for the following: ·"
9710,1996-97,Companies defaulting on payment of interest or repayment of principal on deposits will be debarred from raising further deposits until these defaults are remedied.
9711,1996-97,"The present ceiling of Rs 1,000 on the claims of arrears of wages and salaries of employees in case of winding up of a company is absurdly low."
9712,1996-97,Nonvoting shares will be permitted upto 25% of the issued equity capital.
9713,1996-97,This will go a long way in meeting the demand for a level playing field.
9714,1996-97,Companies in the infrastructure sector will be allowed to issue shares that are redeemable after the expiry of a period of 20 years from the date of issue.
9715,1996-97,Hon’ble Members will agree with me that these changes are necessary 10 and should be introduced right away.
9716,1996-97,"Next year, I shall come back to the House with a new Companies Bill."
9717,1996-97,"In order to achieve competitiveness, Indian industry must be given easy access to improved technology."
9718,1996-97,At present RBI accords automatic approval for technology imports subject to the requirement that royalty will be limited to 5% on domestic sales and 8% on export sales and that the lump sum payment does not exceed Rs 1 crore.
9719,1996-97,All other cases require casebycase approval by the Central government.
9720,1996-97,Industry has represented that the Rs 1 crore limit for automatic approval needs to be increased.
9721,1996-97,"Responding to this demand, it has been decided to increase this limit to $ 2 million equivalent to about Rs 7 crore."
9722,1996-97,"With this liberalisation, a large number of technology import cases will not have to come to government."
9723,1996-97,The Industrial Reconstruction Bank of India IRBI was constituted to function as the principal credit and reconstruction agency.
9724,1996-97,"Thanks to rapid changes, the burden of reconstruction is being shared by different stakeholders including development financial institutions and banks."
9725,1996-97,"I, therefore, propose to transform the IRBI into a fullfledged, allpurpose development finance institution with headquarters in Calcutta."
9726,1996-97,I will soon bring the necessary changes in the statute governing IRBI.
9727,1996-97,"FIPB, Tariff Commission and Disinvestment Commission 4 7 ."
9728,1996-97,"In keeping with the promises made in the Common Minimum Programme, government have reconstituted the Foreign Investment Promotion Board."
9729,1996-97,The Foreign Investment Promotion Council will also be set up shortly.
9730,1996-97,"Together, they will vigorously promote and approve foreign direct investment in India keeping in view the objective of attracting at least $ 10 billion every year."
9731,1996-97,"In order to expedite foreign investment approvals and also increase the transparency of the process, government have decided to expand the list of 35 industries which are eligible for automatic approval upto 51% of foreign equity."
9732,1996-97,"The expanded list will be announced separately by my colleague, the Minister of Industry."
9733,1996-97,"At present, the automatic approval procedure is subject to the requirement that the value of foreign equity should cover the total import of capital goods."
9734,1996-97,This condition was introduced in 1991 when capital goods imports were subject to import licensing.
9735,1996-97,"As capital goods have been free of import licensing restrictions since 1992, this condition is being dropped."
9736,1996-97,Government have also initiated action to set up an independent Tariff Commission.
9737,1996-97,Government have approved the proposal to establish a Disinvestment Commission.
9738,1996-97,Any decision to disinvest will be taken and implemented in a transparent manner.
9739,1996-97,Revenues generated from such disinvestment will be utilised for allocations for education and health and for creating a fund to strengthen public sector enterprises.
9740,1996-97,"The interim Budget for 199697 took credit for Rs 5,000 crore through disinvestment."
9741,1996-97,I propose to take credit for the same amount.
9742,1996-97,"The disinvestment will be done in three tranches, approximately in September, November and January/ February."
9743,1996-97,The Sick Industries Companies Act SICA has a narrow definition of sickness and cannot deal with incipient or potential sickness.
9744,1996-97,Managements have been able to use the BIFR route to abdicate their legitimate responsibilities.
9745,1996-97,"Under the present dispensation workers, financial institutions, banks and government are often the losers."
9746,1996-97,I have initiated a total review of SICA and the working of BIFR and I intend to bring a new Bill in the winter session of Parliament.
9747,1996-97,I have already made a reference to the Chief Ministers’ Conference on Basic Minimum Services.
9748,1996-97,The Prime Minister intends to call another conference of Chief Ministers to discuss the political aspects of CentreState relations and federalism.
9749,1996-97,"At the last conference, the Chief Ministers expressed the view that many centrallysponsored schemes should be retained as such and should continue to be funded by the Central government."
9750,1996-97,"While we respect the views of the Chief Ministers, it is our desire that most Centrallysponsored schemes should be transferred to the control of the State governments."
9751,1996-97,"In the meantime, States will be given greater flexibility in the implementation of these programmes."
9752,1996-97,Provisions available under all other schemes will be pooled and the basic entitlement ratio will be worked out for each State.
9753,1996-97,"The States will be free to select for implementation, within their annual entitlement, such schemes that are more suited to their needs."
9754,1996-97,The Ministry of Planning and Programme Implementation is working on the revised guidelines and procedures in consultation with the concerned Ministries and the States.
9755,1996-97,I also intend to circulate a discussion paper to Hon’ble Members on the 10th Finance Commission’s recommendation to form a single divisible pool of taxes to be shared between the Centre and the States.
9756,1996-97,"Primafacie, the Finance Commission’s recommendation appears to be in the national interest but it will require an amendment to the Constitution."
9757,1996-97,"Hence, I wish to encourage a debate before a final decision is taken."
9758,1996-97,"The Common Minimum Programme has promised that the Government will, within six months, bring out a detailed document that will articulate the priorities and programmes of the Ninth Plan."
9759,1996-97,"While a number of programmes have been initiated in this Budget, it will be our endeavour to prepare an Approach Paper to the Ninth Five Year Plan within four months."
9760,1996-97,"The Ninth Plan will target a growth rate of 7% per annum and will articulate strategies for decentralisation of responsibilities, for raising resources and for ensuring widespread growth."
9761,1996-97,The initiatives that have been taken this year will be followed by a more comprehensive programme of social and economic development with the focus on elimination of poverty.
9762,1996-97,I shall now briefly go over the Budget estimates.
9763,1996-97,As Hon’ble Members are aware details of the revised estimates for 199596 were presented along with the interim Budget in February 1996.
9764,1996-97,"I am, therefore, not going over those estimates again."
9765,1996-97,The figures that are given below are the budget estimates for 199697 and for plan expenditure I shall compare them with the budget estimates for 199596.
9766,1996-97,"For 199697, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 204,698 crore."
9767,1996-97,"Of this, Rs 54,685 crore is gross budgetary support for the Central Plan and assistance to State and UT plans, representing a sharp increase of 13% over Rs 48,500 crore."
9768,1996-97,"Nonplan expenditure is placed at Rs 150,013 crore."
9769,1996-97,"Central assistance for State and UT plans is being stepped up from Rs 19,506 crore to Rs 21,972 crore."
9770,1996-97,The increase will provide funds to the States for implementing the seven Basic Minimum Services schemes to which I have referred earlier.
9771,1996-97,"Gross budgetary support for the Central Plan is being enhanced from Rs 28,994 crore to Rs 32,713 crore."

9777,1996-97,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I hope Hon’ble Members will forgive the Finance Minister if he is partial to the cause of exports."
9778,1996-97,"After all, I cut my teeth in economic administration in the Ministry of Commerce."
9779,1996-97,Promotion of exports must remain high on our agenda.
9780,1996-97,"Hence, I propose to provide a sum of Rs 50 crore for the corpus of the recently established India Brand Equity Fund."
9781,1996-97,I would appeal to industry and trade to contribute at least an equal amount in this financial year itself.
9782,1996-97,A sum of Rs 25 crore has been provided for critical balancing infrastructure.
9783,1996-97,Nonplan provision for export promotion and market development has been enhanced from Rs 315 crore to Rs 460 crore.
9784,1996-97,Deemed exporters will now get refund of terminal excise duty in quick time.

9786,1996-97,"The plan allocation for the Department of Education has been increased substantially from Rs 1,825 crore to Rs 3,388 crore."

9797,1996-97,There are persistent demands from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep for more flexible norms for determining the cost for funding and implementing projects.
9798,1996-97,"Having regard to their special needs, I have agreed to these demands."
9799,1996-97,We will also ensure that the Island Development Authority is activated to accelerate development in these strategic islands.
9800,1996-97,I am happy to inform Hon’ble Members that the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme MPLADS is being continued in the current year.
9801,1996-97,Adequate funds are being made available for this scheme.
9802,1996-97,"The total nonplan expenditure in 199697 is placed at Rs 150,013 crore compared to Rs 123,651 crore in BE 199596 and Rs 134,320 crore in RE 199596."

9806,1996-97,I have already referred to the major new initiatives for giving an impetus to agriculture and irrigation.
9807,1996-97,"The increase on account of higher subsidies for phosphatic and potassic fertilisers will be Rs 1,724 crore over last year’s provision of Rs 500 crore."
9808,1996-97,The enhanced subsidies are expected to lead to a balanced use of various fertilizers for better soil health and productivity.

9815,1996-97,"Nontax revenues, an important component of our receipts, have also shown healthy buoyancy."
9816,1996-97,"The receipts under this head, which were estimated at Rs 29,103 crore in RE 199596, are expected to be Rs 33,035 crore this year."
9817,1996-97,I 14 am confident that we can do better under some heads.

9825,1996-97,I shall come to the Budget deficit and the fiscal deficit in Part B of my speech.
9826,1996-97,"PART B Now, I turn to my tax proposals."
9827,1996-97,"The good news is there are no new direct taxes save one and even that solitary new tax, I am confident, will be almost universally welcomed."
9828,1996-97,"There are pressing demands from all sections of society to raise the threshold limit for personal incometax from the existing level of Rs 40,000 to at least Rs 60,000."
9829,1996-97,"Each increase of Rs 1,000 in the threshold limit will cost the exchequer Rs 150 crore and, since 77.5% of this loss will be borne by the States, any major concession on this front will put a severe strain on the States’ financial resources."
9830,1996-97,"Besides, when the direct tax base is already narrow  only 110 lakh persons pay incometax  no Finance Minister can afford to let 20 or 30 lakhs of them go out of the net."
9831,1996-97,"However, I accept the need to provide relief to the assessees in the first tax bracket, especially the salaried class."
9832,1996-97,"I propose to do so in two ways: first, I propose to reduce the incometax rate for the first bracket from 20 per cent to 15 per cent."
9833,1996-97,This benefit will be available to all assessees.
9834,1996-97,"I also propose to raise the standard deduction from Rs 15,000 to Rs 18,000 for salaried employees having an income upto Rs 60,000."
9835,1996-97,"Thus, a salaried employee with an income of Rs 60,000 per year, making the minimum contribution to his provident fund, will now pay no tax at all."
9836,1996-97,"If he has no savings, he will still pay only Rs 300."
9837,1996-97,We owe a special consideration to our senior citizens.
9838,1996-97,"At present, senior citizens benefit from a special tax rebate of 40% upto an income level of Rs 100,000."
9839,1996-97,"I propose to raise this to Rs 120,000."
9840,1996-97,"Houseowners, residing in their own houses that have been financed by borrowing, deserve relief."
9841,1996-97,"The deduction of interest payments of Rs 10,000 allowed to them from their income from property is proposed to be raised to Rs 15,000."
9842,1996-97,"As another relief measure, I propose to raise the limit under section 80D of the Incometax Act for deduction in respect of insurance on the health of the individual and his family members from Rs 6,000 to Rs 10,000. 8 5 ."
9843,1996-97,I have already mentioned the new scheme of personalcumfamily pension being introduced by LIC.
9844,1996-97,"In order to encourage savings in this form, I 15 propose to allow the contribution to the pension fund to be deducted from taxable income upto a limit of Rs 10,000 per annum."
9845,1996-97,I also propose to exempt the income of such a pension fund in the LIC from the levy of incometax.
9846,1996-97,"At present, a five year tax holiday is available under section 80IA to enterprises engaged in developing, maintaining and operating infrastructure facilities such as roads, highways, bridges, new airports, ports and rail systems."
9847,1996-97,"I propose to extend this incentive to investment in irrigation, water supply, sanitation and sewerage systems."
9848,1996-97,I also propose to provide a five year tax holiday under section 80IA of the Income Tax Act to companies exclusively created to participate in research and development activities.
9849,1996-97,I am also simplifying the existing procedure for giving weighted deduction under section 352AA of the Incometax Act on sums paid for scientific research to a National Laboratory or a University or an Indian Institute of Technology by deleting the condition of approval by an outside body.
9850,1996-97,Infrastructure funds have become an important source of capital to finance infrastructure projects.
9851,1996-97,"In order to encourage such funds established to mobilise resources for financing infrastructure facilities, I propose to exempt them from incometax."
9852,1996-97,"Any dividend, interest or longterm capital gains of such funds or companies from investments in the form of shares or longterm finance in any enterprise set up to develop, maintain and operate an infrastructure facility will be free from income tax."
9853,1996-97,I also propose to allow investment in approved debentures or equity shares of public companies as eligible for tax rebate under section 88 if the proceeds of such public issues are applied to create a new infrastructure facility or to generate or distribute power.
9854,1996-97,"In the case of such investment, the limit of Rs 60,000 under section 88 will be raised to Rs 70,000. 90."
9855,1996-97,Corporate tax rates have been reduced and simplified over the past few years and the results have been very encouraging with a significant increase in corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP.
9856,1996-97,"However, there are two issues which need to be addressed."
9857,1996-97,The first is the promise made in the past that the corporate surcharge will be temporary.
9858,1996-97,"The other is the phenomenon of zero tax companies which, according to many observers, reflects an excessive degree of laxity in the tax regime."
9859,1996-97,I propose to respond to the two issues as follows:
9860,1996-97,The reduced tax burden will benefit all companies big and small.
9861,1996-97,"In a case where the total income of the company, as computed under the Income Tax Act after availing of all eligible deductions, is less than 30 per cent of the book profit, the total income of such a company shall be deemed to be 30 per cent of the book profit and shall be charged to tax accordingly."
9862,1996-97,The effective rate works out to 12 per cent of book profit calculated under the Companies Act.
9863,1996-97,"Companies engaged in the power 16 and infrastructure sectors will, however, be exempted from the levy of MAT. 91."
9864,1996-97,"As a step towards achieving a level playing field for Indian companies visavis the foreign companies, I propose to reduce the tax on longterm capital gains in the case of domestic companies from 30 per cent to 20 per cent."
9865,1996-97,"In order to encourage savings and to channelise savings into investments in priority sectors of the economy, I propose to exempt from tax longterm capital gains if the net consideration received or accruing from the transfer of the capital asset is invested in specified assets for a period of three years or, alternatively, if the entire capital gains are invested in specified assets for a period of seven years."
9866,1996-97,The assessee will now have a choice of two new savings instruments.
9867,1996-97,"I also propose to allow depreciation in the case of fractional ownership of assets because of the need for joint financing of big, capital intensive projects by a consortium of financiers having fractional shares in the assets."
9868,1996-97,"In order to promote efficiency in industry, I propose to provide that unabsorbed depreciation will be carried forward for a period of eight years only in the same manner as business losses."
9869,1996-97,The practice of saleandleaseback of assets results in passing of very high depreciation to the leasing concerns.
9870,1996-97,This needs to be curbed.
9871,1996-97,"Hence, I propose to provide in the Income Tax Act that in case of saleandleaseback transactions, the written down value of the asset, in the hands of lessee, who was the previous owner, will be treated as cost in the hands of the lessor."
9872,1996-97,"This measure, while not affecting bona fide transactions, will prevent lossmaking concerns from indulging in unhealthy tradeoff of depreciation."
9873,1996-97,"I find it unreasonable that commercial properties, not used by the assessee as his business, office or factory premises, should be outside the levy of wealthtax."
9874,1996-97,"Accordingly, I propose to plug this unintended loophole and levy wealth tax on such commercial properties."
9875,1996-97,Exempting under section 1024 of the Income Tax Act the income of an Association of Registered Trade Unions.
9876,1996-97,Extending 100 per cent deduction under section 80G of the Income Tax Act to— Donations made to Illness Assistance Funds established by the Central government and the State governments to meet the medical expenses of the poorest of the poor; Donations made to State and National Councils of Blood Transfusion recently set up by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; and Donations made to the three funds established by the armed forces of the 17 country.
9877,1996-97,"These are the Army Central Welfare Fund, The Indian Naval Benevolent Fund and the Air Force Central Welfare Fund."
9878,1996-97,This is my way of saluting the brave officers and jawans of our armed forces.
9879,1996-97,As a part of our obligation to SAARC I am exempting from income tax the income of SAARC Fund for Regional Projects SFRP.
9880,1996-97,"In order to promote industrial development in the NorthEastern region of the country, a NorthEastern Development Finance Corporation was established in August, 1995."
9881,1996-97,I propose to exempt its income from tax.
9882,1996-97,These proposals are likely to result in an improvement of revenue under direct taxes which is estimated at Rs 912 crore.
9883,1996-97,I shall now come to the proposals relating to indirect taxes.
9884,1996-97,"Over the last few years steps have been taken to reform our indirect tax structure by reducing the number of rates, removing exemptions and by switching over to advalorem rates."
9885,1996-97,On the customs side the peak rate of duty was reduced to 50% in 199596 accompanied by reduction in rates down the line in respect of all commodities.
9886,1996-97,Central excise duties were also revamped and moved closer to a Value Added Tax with the introduction of Modvat for capital goods and extension of input credit facilities to almost all items necessary for the manufacture of goods.
9887,1996-97,"These changes have contributed to the growth in industrial production, simplified the tax structure and brought about greater transparency."
9888,1996-97,"They have also led to strong growth in revenues, with indirect tax collections increasing by 19 per cent in each of the last two years, in spite of substantial reduction in rates."
9889,1996-97,The Common Minimum Programme mandates the government to continue with tax reforms and I propose to do so.
9890,1996-97,"Keeping in view the twin objectives of making our industry globally competitive and providing it reasonable levels of protection in the transitional period, I propose to take measured and calibrated steps in the matter of customs tariffs."
9891,1996-97,The salient features of my proposals are— Reduction in customs duties on crude oil and other basic petrochemical intermediates.
9892,1996-97,"Reduction in the rates of customs duties on raw materials and inputs such as chemicals, plastics, natural rubber and ferrous and nonferrous metals."
9893,1996-97,Substantial reduction in customs duties on raw materials and components required for giving a thrust to the electronic goods sector.
9894,1996-97,Reduction in the rate of duty on computers for giving a boost to the software industry.
9895,1996-97,Reduction in import duty on selected machinery to modernize the textiles and garment sector.
9896,1996-97,Removal of several anomalies in duty rates.
9897,1996-97,"Retention of only such exemptions which are necessary, for the present."
9898,1996-97,This is an area in which India can exploit its potential of trained technical manpower and become a leading nation of the world in the production of chemicals.
9899,1996-97,"To achieve these objectives, I propose to take the following steps: · Reduction in the rate of duty on crude oil from 35% to 25%."
9900,1996-97,Reduction in the rate of duty on bitumen from 30% to 10%.
9901,1996-97,"Unification of rates at 10% on petrochemical building blocks such as cumene, toluene and cyclohexane."
9902,1996-97,"Reduction in the rate of duty on chemicals, both organic and inorganic, from 50% to 40%."
9903,1996-97,Our textile industry employs millions of people.
9904,1996-97,It is necessary to modernise it and provide an environment in which it can grow rapidly.
9905,1996-97,I propose the following measures: · Reduction in the import duty on rayon grade wood pulp from 25% to 5%.
9906,1996-97,Reduction in the import duty on acrylonitrile from 20% to 10%.
9907,1996-97,"Reduction in the rate of duty on DMT, PTA and MEG from 35% to 25%; however in the case of caprolactum the revised duty will be 30%."
9908,1996-97,Reduction in the rate of duty on artificial and synthetic fibres from 45% to 30%.
9909,1996-97,"Unification of the rates of duty on nylon filament yarn, polyester filament yarn and viscose filament yarn from the existing levels of 45% and 40% at 30%."
9910,1996-97,"I also propose a major restructuring of excise duties in the textile sector, extending the benefit of Modvat, to which I shall come a little later."
9911,1996-97,I am confident that with these measures our textile industry will grow from strength to strength in the coming years.
9912,1996-97,Our power plants face a shortage of coal on account of growing demand and better utilisation of installed capacity.
9913,1996-97,I propose to reduce the rate of duty on noncoking coal from 35% to 20%.
9914,1996-97,I also propose reduction of duty on coke from the existing level of 25% to 20%.
9915,1996-97,Our plastics industry is coming of age.
9916,1996-97,I propose a reduction of duty on plastics from 40% to 30%.
9917,1996-97,"Further, on articles of plastics I propose a reduction from the existing level of 50% to 40%."
9918,1996-97,"In regard to rates of duties on drugs and pharmaceuticals, I propose to retain the zero rate of duty on life saving drugs."
9919,1996-97,I also propose to reduce the rate · · India has become a major producer and exporter of chemicals.
9920,1996-97,This 19 of duty on all other allopathic medicines from 50% to 40%.
9921,1996-97,In order to make available veterinary drugs commonly used I propose to reduce the rate on specified veterinary drugs from 15% to 10%.
9922,1996-97,"There has been a persistent complaint from industry that customs duty on metals is very high and this makes it difficult for downstream industry, especially capital goods, to be competitive."
9923,1996-97,Industry has been demanding that the rate of duty on metals should be brought down drastically.
9924,1996-97,"However, realising the need to provide adequate time to our metals industry to adjust itself to global competition, I propose a modest reduction from 35% or 40% at present to a peak rate of 30% on all metals except nickel and aluminum."
9925,1996-97,On unwrought aluminum and unwrought nickel I propose to retain the current level of 10% and 20% respectively.
9926,1996-97,On wrought aluminum I propose to reduce the duty from 25% to 20% and on wrought nickel from 30% to 20%.
9927,1996-97,"While I do not wish to tamper with the rate of duty on machinery which stands at 25%, I propose a reduction of duty on signaling and safety equipment for railways, airports, sea ports etc."
9928,1996-97,The last three years have witnessed a tremendous growth in our electronic industry which has been the result of enterprise as well as the stimulation provided by sharp reduction in customs duties.
9929,1996-97,"In order to maintain this trend, I propose the following changes: · On raw materials, from the existing 15% to 10% · On components, from 25% to 20%. ·"
9930,1996-97,"On glass shells for colour TVs, from 30% to 25%. ·"
9931,1996-97,"On colour picture tubes, from 40% to 30%. ·"
9932,1996-97,"On computers and computer peripherals, from 40% to 20%."
9933,1996-97,Finished goods will continue to attract 50% rate of duty.
9934,1996-97,"With a view to encourage sports in the country, I also propose to reduce import duty on sports goods from 50% to 30%."
9935,1996-97,In order to give relief to professional press photographers I propose to allow them to import free of duty photographic equipment upto Rs 1 lakh.
9936,1996-97,"A similar concession is also being extended to accredited journalists for import of personal computer, typewriter and fax machine."
9937,1996-97,Telecommunication is a growing sector and will turn out to be the lifeline of our economy.
9938,1996-97,The existence of an efficient telecommunication net work is a pre requisite for accelerated economic growth.
9939,1996-97,"In order to give a boost to the efforts being made by the Department of Telecommunications, I propose that the duty on parts and subassemblies of telecommunication equipment be reduced from 35% to 30% and on finished equipment from 50% to 40%."
9940,1996-97,"In order to avoid the temptation to smuggle cellular phones, pagers and trunking handsets, I propose to reduce the customs duty on them to 30%."
9941,1996-97,Upgradation of medical standards in the country is extremely important.
9942,1996-97,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of duty on specified equipment, not generally 20 made in India, and their parts from 15% to 10% and on other medical equipment from 40% to 30%."
9943,1996-97,Edible oils now carry a rate of duty of 30%.
9944,1996-97,This is an important item of daily food for the masses and we have a chronic shortage of edible oils in the country.
9945,1996-97,I propose to reduce the import duty on edible oils from 30% to 20%.
9946,1996-97,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, earlier in my speech I dwelt on the dire need to step up investment in infrastructure."
9947,1996-97,I had also detailed the sectors to which I propose to make large allocations.
9948,1996-97,I have to raise resources to meet these requirements.
9949,1996-97,"I intend to ask importers to share the burden of building the infrastructure in this country because, ultimately, it will help raise production and enhance competitiveness."
9950,1996-97,"I, therefore, propose a levy of 2% as special customs duty on all imports except those that carry nil rate of duty or are imported at nil rate of customs duty for export production under the various duty free licences."
9951,1996-97,This levy will not apply to gold and silver imported by eligible passengers or under special import licences.
9952,1996-97,This is likely to yield about Rs 1600 crore in the current year.
9953,1996-97,"Importers will be happy to know that the Reserve Bank of India is announcing today the withdrawal of the interest rate surcharge of 25% on import finance imposed in February, 1996."
9954,1996-97,I now come to my proposals regarding central excise.
9955,1996-97,A large number of countries in the world today have a value added tax system which has been recognised to be the most efficient form of commodity taxation.
9956,1996-97,I am glad to note that some State governments are moving towards the value added tax system.
9957,1996-97,"The last few years of reforms have taken us closer to having a Central VAT, but there are still certain legal obstacles. 122."
9958,1996-97,Our central excise structure still has 11 advalorem rates.
9959,1996-97,The rates range from 0 to 50 per cent.
9960,1996-97,"Ideally there should be only four rates of excise duties Ñ zero, a lower rate of excise duty on goods of mass consumption, a single normal rate on all other goods and a higher rate on luxury items."
9961,1996-97,It is absolutely necessary for us to move towards this rate structure so that we put an end to wasteful litigation and have a transparent and simple tax structure.
9962,1996-97,It was not possible in the time available to me in preparing this Budget to achieve this goal in the current year.
9963,1996-97,"However, I propose to take the first step this year and I am confident that we will achieve a fourrate excise duty structure in another year or two."
9964,1996-97,I propose to integrate the tax on the textile sector with the mainstream of central excise duties by introducing the Modvat principle in this sector.
9965,1996-97,"Hon’ble Members are aware that at present excise duties are levied at the fibre and yarn stage and there is only an additional excise duty, in lieu of sales tax, on fabrics."
9966,1996-97,"This is one of the most inefficient ways of taxation as it results in very high duties on inputs, which encourages evasion; it does not capture value addition; and it denies the industry an opportunity of claiming Modvat input credit on capital goods, chemicals and yarn."
9967,1996-97,"While modernisation of other industries is taking place speedily, our textile industry has not been able to participate fully in this process because of this lopsided tax structure."
9968,1996-97,"I, therefore, make the following proposals."
9969,1996-97,"I propose to reduce the excise duty on yarn in the case of polyester filament yarn from the current level of 50% to 40% and unify the rates on other yarn at 21 20%, except nylon filament yarn and cotton yarn for which the present rates of 30% and 5% respectively will be retained."
9970,1996-97,"In order to provide Modvat for the textile sector, I propose to impose a basic excise duty of 5% on cotton fabrics and 10% on other fabrics which will be collected at the processed fabric stage."
9971,1996-97,The processors would be in a position to Modvat the duty paid on yarn imputed on the basis that yarn accounts for 50% of the value of the finished fabric.
9972,1996-97,I have adopted a simple procedure of imputed value to avoid the imposition of a basic duty on grey fabrics which are manufactured by thousands of powerlooms.
9973,1996-97,"Such powerlooms will, therefore, continue to be outside the excise net."
9974,1996-97,Composite mills and textile processors will be able to avail themselves of Modvat facilities hitherto not extended to them.
9975,1996-97,"This restructuring of excise duty, together with the substantial reduction in customs duties on selected machinery and on inputs for the textile sector, should provide a major boost to the textile industry."
9976,1996-97,I believe that this will also simplify the calculation of drawback rates for garment exporters.
9977,1996-97,"In my proposals on customs duties, I have proposed a reduction in customs duty on crude oil from 35% to 25%."
9978,1996-97,This is part of a restructuring and rationalisation of the duty structure aimed at encouraging efficient refineries and enabling me to shift the duties from the input stage to the product stage.
9979,1996-97,I propose to make up the loss on customs duty by adjusting the excise duty upward from 10% to 15% on all petroleum products except LPG and kerosene.
9980,1996-97,The proposed changes in customs and excise duties taken together are revenue neutral and will have no impact on the administered prices of petroleum products.
9981,1996-97,Honourable Members are aware that almost all articles of mass consumption are already exempt from excise duty and a large number of other widely consumed articles carry a rate of only 10%.
9982,1996-97,I propose to exempt some more articles from excise duty.
9983,1996-97,They are: a Vanaspati and margarine; b Writing and printing paper supplied to all State Text Book Corporations; c Animal fats and oils; d Asbestos fibre; e Metallic ores; and f Tapioca products.
9984,1996-97,"I propose to reduce the duty on the following articles: a Tooth paste, from 20% to 10%; b Detergents, from 30% to 25%; c Cartons, boxes and bags made of paper and paperboard, from 20% to 10%; d Glassware produced by semiautomatic process, from 20% to 10%; e Glassware used for table, kitchen etc., from 15% to 10%; f Articles of asbestos cement, from 25% to 20%; and g Ceramic articles, other than glazed tiles, from 20% to 15%."
9985,1996-97,I also propose to raise the exemption limit for footwear from Rs 50 to Rs  75 per pair.
9986,1996-97,The rates of excise duty on motor vehicles are not in consonance with the accepted classification of such vehicles.
9987,1996-97,"I therefore propose the following rationalisation: 22 a Duty on motor cars and other motor vehicles principally designed to carry not more than six persons, excluding the driver, will remain unchanged at 40%."
9988,1996-97,There is no change in the duty on twowheelers or tractors.
9989,1996-97,"If there is one area in which a Finance Minister can both tax and please, it is cigarettes."
9990,1996-97,"Today, however, I shall please you only in a small way by proposing modest increases in the specific duties on cigarettes ranging from about 5% to 71/ 2%."
9991,1996-97,"In the case of nonfilter cigarettes, not exceeding 60 mm in length, popularly called mini cigarettes, I propose to raise the tax by 25% from Rs 60 per thousand to Rs 75 per thousand. 131."
9992,1996-97,In order to encourage R & D efforts in India I propose to exempt goods developed and patented in India and concurrently in specified countries from the levy of excise duty for a period of three years.
9993,1996-97,I am also rationalising the exemption from customs duty for import of equipment and consumables for R&D institutions.
9994,1996-97,"I have proposed the addition of potassium chlorate, copper powder and cigarette lighters to the list of goods eligible for duty exemption under the SSI scheme."
9995,1996-97,The reduction in import duties proposed elsewhere will also substantially benefit the small scale industries.
9996,1996-97,In order to benefit hundreds of small scale manufacturers of matches I have decided to dispense with the physical control system operating on them and introduce the self removal procedure freeing them from the day to day bother of control.
9997,1996-97,I hope SSI match units will respond with substantial increase in payment of excise duties.
9998,1996-97,I have proposed rationalisation of rates and exemptions both in customs and excise in several other areas.
9999,1996-97,I would not like to take the time of the House by going into these details.
10000,1996-97,Our excise procedures are outdated and not in tune with the times.
10001,1996-97,They need to be modified.
10002,1996-97,They should encourage voluntary compliance with tax laws by the tax payers.
10003,1996-97,"With effect from 1st October,1996, assessees would no longer be required to furnish copies of invoices along with the monthly returns."
10004,1996-97,All that they would be required to furnish to the excise department will be a simple Return indicating the duty paid on self assessment basis.
10005,1996-97,Wherever possible the assessees’ computers could also be linked to the Department’s computers for on line assessment.
10006,1996-97,I also propose to introduce a scheme of selective audit by the excise officers and dispense with the existing scheme of routine examination and checking of returns and documents furnished by the assessees.
10007,1996-97,"This scheme would also come into force from 1st October, 1996."
10008,1996-97,I am sure that these changes would be widely welcomed by the manufacturers who are required to pay excise duties and I expect them to comply with the laws faithfully.
10009,1996-97,"However, I wish to affirm government’s resolve to deal with 23 tax evaders sternly."
10010,1996-97,"I am proposing suitable changes in the Customs and Excise Acts to provide for mandatory penalty, together with interest, for evasion of duties on account of fraud, collusion, misstatement or suppression of facts."
10011,1996-97,"Henceforth, the mandatory penalty for evasion of duty on these counts shall be equal to the amount of duty evaded."
10012,1996-97,Tax evaders would also be required to pay interest starting from the first day of the succeeding month in which the duty evaded ought to have been paid and also face criminal prosecution.
10013,1996-97,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Central Excise and Salt Act, 1944, reminds us of the colonial era when excise duty was collected on salt."
10014,1996-97,There is no excise duty on salt and hence the reference to salt is outdated.
10015,1996-97,I propose to delete all references to salt.
10016,1996-97,The Modvat scheme which provides for duty credit on inputs and capital goods has been liberalised considerably over the past few years.
10017,1996-97,"Still, there are problems about the coverage of certain inputs and capital goods."
10018,1996-97,I propose to clarify the scope of eligible capital goods by specifying the heading and subheadings of the tariff relating to capital goods in the Modvat Rules.
10019,1996-97,It is also a matter of concern that there is misuse of the Modvat credit scheme.
10020,1996-97,"At present, Modvat invoices can be issued by any dealer registered with the excise department and this facility is reportedly being misused."
10021,1996-97,"Therefore, I propose to restrict the issue of Modvatable invoices by dealers upto two stages."
10022,1996-97,Suitable provisions are also being made in the Modvat Rules for charging of interest in the case of wrong availment of Modvat credit and for mandatory penalty for misuse of Modvat facility.
10023,1996-97,The tax on services has come to stay.
10024,1996-97,"With a view to widening the tax base, I propose to bring in advertising services, radio paging services and courier services under the tax net."
10025,1996-97,The tax on these services will be at the rate of 5%.
10026,1996-97,"While this measure is expected to yield Rs 150 crore in a full year, I am taking credit only of Rs 70 crore in the current year."
10027,1996-97,My proposals relating to reduction in customs duties are estimated to result in a loss of Rs 650 crore in the remaining part of the current financial year.
10028,1996-97,"However, by taking into account receipts from the special customs duty estimated to be Rs 1600 crore, there will be a net gain of Rs 950 crore in customs revenue."
10029,1996-97,"In the case of excise duties, including additional excise duties, a gain of Rs 760 crore is estimated."
10030,1996-97,"Of this, the States are likely to get Rs 384 crore as their share of excise duties."
10031,1996-97,"I now have something to say on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Communications."
10032,1996-97,"Postal rates, some of which were last revised in 1990, do not meet even the direct cost of most of the services resulting in increasing budgetary support."
10033,1996-97,"Not withstanding this, no change in the rates of ordinary postcard, letter, parcels and other postal services is being proposed."
10034,1996-97,A modest increase is proposed only in respect of two services which are used for business and commercial purposes.
10035,1996-97,The rate of the printed post card is being increased from 60p. to Re.1 and the registration fee is being increased from Rs  6 to Rs 8.
10036,1996-97,"It has also been decided to introduce a new category of postcard, called Competition Postcard, which alone may be used for responding to any competition organised on or through television, radio, newspapers or magazines."
10037,1996-97,It is proposed to remove the unintended subsidisation by fixing the tariff for this category of postcard at Rs 2.
10038,1996-97,The changes 24 will take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed.
10039,1996-97,"The revisions proposed are estimated to yield a modest revenue of Rs 38 crore in 1996 97, still leaving a large postal deficit."
10040,1996-97,Copies of notifications giving effect to the above changes in customs and excise duties will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
10041,1996-97,My budget proposals have many implications both for the expenditure side and the revenue side.
10042,1996-97,"However, Hon’ble Members will be pleased to know that the end result is satisfactory."
10043,1996-97,"The revenue deficit in 199697 is placed at Rs 31,475 crore or 2.5% of GDP which is significantly lower than Rs 33,331 crore in RE 1995 96 or 3% of GDP."
10044,1996-97,"The fiscal deficit comes to Rs 62,266 crore in 199697, which is lower than the figure of Rs 64,010 crore in RE 199596."
10045,1996-97,"As a percentage of GDP, the fiscal deficit is 5% in 199697 compared to 5.9% in the previous year."
10046,1996-97,I hope to do better in my next budget and move along the path of reducing the fiscal deficit to below 4%.
10047,1996-97,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, at the end of this exercise, I ask myself what is a budget about?"
10048,1996-97,"While it is a measure of the health of the economy, it is also a mirror to the travails and aspirations of the people."
10049,1996-97,"I have made an attempt to raise revenues without putting any burden upon the poor, to allocate large resources for agriculture, irrigation, infrastructure and the social sector, to provide more funds for basic minimum services, to give tax reliefs to the salaried and the middle classes and to promote savings and investment."
10050,1996-97,I have strived to serve the seven objectives that I declared at the outset.
10051,1996-97,The Common Minimum Programme is absolutely right when it says that the country’s GDP needs to grow at over 7% per year in the next 10 years in order to abolish poverty and unemployment.
10052,1996-97,I believe that our economy is on a high growth curve.
10053,1996-97,Wisdom dictates that we remain on that curve.
10054,1996-97,"In order to do so, we need more reforms, not less."
10055,1996-97,"We need more resources, not less."
10056,1996-97,"We need more discipline, not less."
10057,1996-97,"And we need more compassion, not less."
10058,1996-97,"If we remain true to the Common Minimum Programme, we shall overcome our difficulties and take India to the frontline of the nations of the world."
10059,1996-97,"This budget, my maiden effort, attempts to blend Ñ I hope in the right proportions Ñ courage and compassion, reform and restraint and growth and social justice."
10060,1996-97,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend this budget to this august House."
10061,1997-98,"Sir,I rise to present the Budget for the year 199798."
10062,1997-98,The government headed by Prime Minster Shri Deve Gowda completes nine months today.
10063,1997-98,"When I stood before this House on July 22, 1996, this House received my proposals with a mixture of wonder, curiosity and scepticism."
10064,1997-98,"I was, after all, the Finance Minister of the genuine coalition government at the Centre."
10065,1997-98,"I was also the first Finance Minister who belonged to an avowed regional party, albeit with a national outlook."
10066,1997-98,One national party acknowledged that it had lost its claim to form the government.
10067,1997-98,"Another tried, but failed."
10068,1997-98,"It is in that situation that regional parties, and certain parties with a larger national presence, came together to form the United Front government."
10069,1997-98,"These partieslong regarded as children of a lesser Godhave demonstrated that, given the opportunity, they can form a government not only at the State level but also at the Centre."
10070,1997-98,"Inspired by the idea off a truly cooperative federal polity, Chief Ministers have assembled, more often than ever before, at the InterState Council, the National Development Council and at the Special Conferences to formulate national policies."
10071,1997-98,"The formulations of the government by the United Front and our efforts to take decisions by a national consensus, in the fiftieth year of India’s independence, have deepened and broadened Indian democracy."
10072,1997-98,The foundation of the Budget remains the Common Minimum Programme.
10073,1997-98,The experience of the last eight months has demonstrated the enormous strengths of the programme.
10074,1997-98,"Drawing on the CMP, my first Budget articulated seven broad objectives."
10075,1997-98,"These objectives embraced vital elements such as growth, basic minimum services, employment, macroeconomic stability, 1 2 investment particularly in infrastructure, human development and a viable balance of payments."
10076,1997-98,I believe these objectives remain as valid today as they were eight months ago.
10077,1997-98,July 1996 Budget Promises 5.
10078,1997-98,"On the last occasion, I had made over forty specific promises on policies and programmes."
10079,1997-98,"I have carefully taken stock of the situation, and Hon’ble Members will be pleased to know that I have fulfilled all these promises, save one, to which I shall refer presently."
10080,1997-98,"To recall the more important ones, I am happy to state that we have · Provided an additional sum of Rs  2466 crore to the States for seven Basic Minimum Services; · Funded the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDFII with Rs  2500 crore; · Expanded the list of industries eligible for automatic approval for foreign equity investment; · Set up the Disinvestment Commission and the Tariff Commission; · Introduced the Jeevan Suraksha and the Jan Arogya insurance schemes; and · Launched the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme."
10081,1997-98,The one commitment that I have been unable to keep is to set up an Expenditure Management and Reforms Commission.
10082,1997-98,I failed because I wanted an A team and I was not content with a B team.
10083,1997-98,"Key members of the A team are in this House and in the Rajya Sabha, and they still elude me."
10084,1997-98,"Meanwhile, I have not let up on my resolve to keep expenditure within the Budget, and I have achieved a fair measure of success."
10085,1997-98,The Economic Survey 199697 was laid in the Parliament a few days ago.
10086,1997-98,It provided a detailed and balanced account of the state of the economy.
10087,1997-98,"There is indeed much to be done, but there is also much to be proud of."
10088,1997-98,The outstanding feature of the economy is that the GDP has been growing during the last three years at an average rate of 7%.
10089,1997-98,"I salute the farmers, the workers, the entrepreneurs and the service providers who have made this possible."
10090,1997-98,"The positive features of our economic performance in 199697 include: · Continued high economic growth at 6.8%; · A strong recovery of growth in agriculture and allied sectors to 3.7%, after a disappointing minus 0.1% in 199596; · Rebound in foodgrains production to 191 million tonnes; ·"
10091,1997-98,Manufacturing sector growth at 10.6%; and ·
10092,1997-98,"A sizeable build up in our foreign currency reserves from US$ 17.0 billion to US$ 19.5 billion as on February 27, 1997."
10093,1997-98,I shall not be true to myself or to the country if I did not highlight the areas of weakness.
10094,1997-98,Two areas of great concern are the sharp drop in domestic crude oil production and the sluggish performance of the power sector.
10095,1997-98,"Other matters of concern include a deceleration in the growth of exports, a rise in the rate of inflation and a volatile capital market."
10096,1997-98,Government has addressed these concerns through some farreaching initiatives in the last three months.
10097,1997-98,I have also fresh proposals in this Budget.
10098,1997-98,"Macroeconomic management involves, inevitably, striking a balance between various objectives and considerations."
10099,1997-98,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, in 199596, the growth in money supply was reduced sharply to 13.2%."
10100,1997-98,"Although this helped to contain inflation, it also led to high real interest rates, a widespread perception of a liquidity crunch and a slackening of investment proposals."
10101,1997-98,"Since July 1996, corrective action has been taken which has eased the availability of money and brought down the interest rates."
10102,1997-98,"The longdelayed increase in the prices of petroleum products and supplyside problems, arising mainly out of lower production and lower procurement of wheat in the last season, exerted pressure on the price level."
10103,1997-98,Government has taken a number of steps to maintain price stability.
10104,1997-98,Paddy production and procurement in the Kharif season have been satisfactory and we have adequate stocks of rice.
10105,1997-98,The Rabi wheat crop is also very promising and steps will be taken to maximise procurement.
10106,1997-98,"At the same time, I would like to make it clear that, if necessary, government will not hesitate to import wheat and other essential articles to counter the pressure on prices."
10107,1997-98,Maintaining price stability is high on the agenda of this government.
10108,1997-98,"Apart from supply side management, we have to adopt prudent fiscal and monetary policies that will stabilise prices."
10109,1997-98,"For the year 199798, the government and RBI will act in concert towards a further reduction in the fiscal deficit, containment of the growth of money supply within 16% and adoption of a liberal import policy for essential commodities."
10110,1997-98,Our goal is to break inflationary expectations and reduce the rate of inflation from the present level.
10111,1997-98,Our fight against poverty is not a game in populism.
10112,1997-98,It is a battle at the grassroots level.
10113,1997-98,"It is a battle in which, I believe, all of us ought to be on the side of the poor."
10114,1997-98,Those who are poor are those who do not have land or water or education or opportunity.
10115,1997-98,"Our programmes, therefore, revolve around the concerns of the poor."
10116,1997-98,For example · The flagship programme of the Prime Minister is the Basic Minimum Services plan.
10117,1997-98,"As against Rs  2466 crore in the current year, I propose to provide Rs  3300 crore for this programme in 199798."
10118,1997-98,This will include Rs  330 crore for slum development. ·
10119,1997-98,The provision for the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme is being enhanced from Rs  900 crore to Rs  1300 crore in 199798.
10120,1997-98,"The Ganga Kalyan Yojana is intended to support farmers to take up schemes for groundwater and surface water utilisation through a mixture of subsidy, maintenance support and credit arrangements."
10121,1997-98,Rs  200 crore · · is being provided in 199798.
10122,1997-98,"On august 15, 1997, the Prime Minister will inaugurate the Kasturba Gandhi Shiksha Yojana, a programme to establish special schools for girl children in the districts which have particularly low literacy rate."
10123,1997-98,I have placed Rs  250 crore in the Budget for 199798.
10124,1997-98,"All current schemes, addressed to different target groups such as PMRY, IRDP, NRY etc., will be reoriented to provide skillbased training, entrepreneurship development and subsidylinked bank credit to 1 million youth to empower them to start viable small business."
10125,1997-98,"While maintaining the large outlays for these programmes, it is necessary to rationalise their number and make them more focussed and effective."
10126,1997-98,"The Planning Commission is now engaged in a comprehensive exercise and the revised portfolio of poverty alleviation programmes will be implemented with effect from April 1, 1997."
10127,1997-98,Agriculture is the lifeblood of our economy.
10128,1997-98,The CMP calls for a doubling of the flow of credit to agriculture and agroindustries within five years.
10129,1997-98,"In 1996 97, the first year of this government, it is estimated that credit flow to agriculture will increase from about Rs  22,000 crore to nearly Rs  28,600 crorean increase of an unprecedented Rs  6,600 crore."
10130,1997-98,Hon’ble Members will be glad to know that the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF has proved to be popular and successful.
10131,1997-98,"Under RIDF I, Rs  2,000 crore was sanctioned for 4,530 projects."
10132,1997-98,"By March 1997, disbursements will amount to about Rs  1,400 crore."
10133,1997-98,"Under RIDFII, 8,387 projects worth over Rs  2,500 crore have been sanctioned."
10134,1997-98,"RIDFIII will be launched in 199798 and Rs  2,500 crore will be provided."
10135,1997-98,I urge the States to continue to make the best use of these funds.
10136,1997-98,The policy of recapitalising the Regional Rural Banks RRBs will continue next year.
10137,1997-98,I am providing Rs  270 crore for this purpose.
10138,1997-98,I also intend to allow a greater role to sponsor banks in the ownership and management of RRBs.
10139,1997-98,NABARD has been given Rs  500 crore as advance additional share capitalRs  100 crore by government and Rs  400 crore by RBIin the current year.
10140,1997-98,The share capital will be augmented by a similar allocation in 199798.
10141,1997-98,"I am also glad to announce that, as promised last year, NABARD has promoted and incorporated this month, state level agricultural development finance institutions in three States as joint ventures."
10142,1997-98,More will be incorporated next year.
10143,1997-98,"The CMP said that all controls on agricultural products will be reviewed and, wherever found unnecessary, will be abolished."
10144,1997-98,Only some regulations are by the Central government and a beginning is being made by abolishing a few.
10145,1997-98,"The Rice Milling Industries Regulation Act, 1958 and the Ginning and Pressing Factories Act, 1925 will be repealed."
10146,1997-98,"Licensing, price control and requisitioning under the Cold Storage Order, 1964 will be removed."
10147,1997-98,"The Edible Oils and Edible Oil Seeds Storage Control Order, 1977 and the Cotton Control Order, 1986 will be invoked Our government believes that poverty alleviation programmes are 5 only in welldefined emergency situations."

10149,1997-98,An international Castor Oil Futures Exchange will be set up.
10150,1997-98,I urge State governments to follow this lead and abolish as many controls as possible.
10151,1997-98,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, government has recently enhanced the investment ceiling for plant and machinery of small scale industries SSIs to Rs  3 crore and of tiny units to Rs  25 lakhs."
10152,1997-98,"In order to ensure that credit is available to all segments of the nowenlarged SSI sector, the RBI is issuing instructions that out of the funds normally available to the SSI sector, 40% will be reserved for units with investment in plant and machinery between 5 lakhs, 20% for units with investment between Rs  5 lakhs and Rs  25 lakhs and the remaining 40% for other SSI units."
10153,1997-98,Government also announced recently that it will examine carefully the other recommendations of the Abid Hussain Committee on the SSI sector.
10154,1997-98,"With a view to reduce wastage in agricultural commodities, improve quality and hygiene and promote exports, the Advisory Committee on reservation and dereservation has recommended that 14 items, now reserved for manufacture in the SSI sector, may be dereserved."
10155,1997-98,Government has accepted these recommendations.
10156,1997-98,"The dereserved items include ricemilling, dal milling, poultry feed, vinegar, synthetic syrups, biscuits, ice cream, a variety of automobile parts and corrugated paper and boards."
10157,1997-98,It is expected that new investment and improved technology will flow into these businesses.
10158,1997-98,"A constraint on adding to the housing stock of the country is the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act, 1976."
10159,1997-98,It is the intention of the government to move a Bill for amending the Act in this session of the Parliament.
10160,1997-98,Indira Awas Yojana was launched to build houses for the poor in rural areas.
10161,1997-98,"Housing finance companies provide credit, but the bulk of such credit flows into the urban and semiurban areas."
10162,1997-98,"There are some rural housing credit programmes but they lend meagre amounts up to Rs  10,000."
10163,1997-98,There is virtually no source of credit for the farmer who wishes to build a modest house on his freehold land or to improve or add to his old dwelling.
10164,1997-98,This gap must be filled.
10165,1997-98,In consultation with the National Housing Bank NHB and others I have worked out a plan.
10166,1997-98,"Loans, up to Rs  2 lakhs, will be given for building houses on freehold land in rural areas at normal rates of interest, subject to the borrower putting in onethird of the value of the house."

10181,1997-98,"In the meanwhile, government has decided to delegate more monetary powers to the Boards of profitmaking enterprises."
10182,1997-98,"For these PSUs, the existing limits for capital expenditure that can be incurred without the prior approval of the government is being doubled straightaway, and where the gross block is over Rs  500 crore, the limit will be Rs  100 crore."
10183,1997-98,"The Disinvestment Commission was constituted in August, 1996 and 40 PSUs were referred to the Commission for advice."
10184,1997-98,The Commission has submitted its first report.
10185,1997-98,It has made specific recommendations in respect of three companies.
10186,1997-98,We intend to proceed with the disinvestment in these companies along the lines suggested by the Commission.
10187,1997-98,"While the Commission will make further reports every month, a second batch of PSUs has been referred to the Commission."
10188,1997-98,"As the Commission has observed “The essence of a longterm disinvestment strategy should be not only to enhance budgetary receipts, but also minimise budgetary support towards unprofitable units while ensuring their longterm viability and sustainable levels of employment in them.”"
10189,1997-98,Government agrees with this view and I appeal to Hon’ble Members to take a positive view of disinvestment.
10190,1997-98,"The country’s demand for petroleum products is growing at over 8% per annum, which is faster than the growth of domestic supply."
10191,1997-98,We cannot choke this growth.
10192,1997-98,"At the same time, we must reduce our dependence on imported petroleum products."
10193,1997-98,There is no real alternative to increasing the supply.
10194,1997-98,"Just 6 of the 26 basins that have potential for oil and gas in India have been explored, and that too only partially."
10195,1997-98,"The Minister for State for Petroleum and Natural Gas will be making a detailed In 1995, the Central government enhanced the ceiling on the amount 7 statement on the new exploration licensing policy NELP shortly."
10196,1997-98,"The highlights of the policy are the following: · Companies, including ONGC and OIL, will be paid the international price of oil for new discoveries made under the NELP; · Royalty payments will be fixed on an ad valorem basis instead of the present system of specific rates; · Royalty payments for exploration in deep waters will be charged at half the rate for offshore areas for the first seven years after commencement of commercial production; · Freedom for marketing crude oil and gas in the domestic market; · Tax holiday for seven years after commencement of commercial production for blocks in the NorthEast region; · ONGC and OIL will get the same duty concessions on import of capital goods under the NELP as private production sharing contracts; · Cess levied under the Oil Industry Development Act, 1974 will be abolished for the new exploration blocks; and · A separate petroleum tax code will be put in place as in other countries to facilitate new investments."
10197,1997-98,It is my fervent hoe that Indian and foreign companies will respond positively to this package of measures.
10198,1997-98,"In order to ensure that adequate domestic refining capacity is created, I propose to allow refineries to import capital goods during the Ninth Plan period at a concessional duty on par with the fertiliser sector."

10221,1997-98,The committee appointed by me draft a new Companies Bill has also made valuable suggestions.
10222,1997-98,"After considering these suggestions, I propose to accept five recommendations: · The principle of buyback of shares by companies subject to certain conditions will be introduced in the Companies Act; · The provisions of Sections 370 and 372 of the Companies Act will be merged and an overall ceiling of 60% will be kept for intercorporate investment and loans; · The Companies Act will be amended to provide for nomination facilities for holder of securities; · Companies raising funds from the capital market will be required to give an annual statement disclosing the enduse of such funds; and · One time permission will be given to stockbrokers to corporatise their business without attracting tax on capital gains, which will be exempted."
10223,1997-98,"I am of the firm view that markets will prosper when economic growth continues to be strong, the fiscal deficit is reduced, interest rates decline and investors are reassured that their interests are secure."
10224,1997-98,FERA and Money Laundering 38.
10225,1997-98,"As we progress towards a more open economy with greater trade and investment linkages with the rest of the world, the regulations governing foreign exchange transactions also need to be modernised."
10226,1997-98,"It is generally acknowledged that the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 needs to be replaced by a new law consistent with full current account convertibility and our objective of progressively liberalising capital account transactions."
10227,1997-98,"Hence, I propose to introduce, later this year, a Bill titled The Foreign Exchange Management Act."
10228,1997-98,A RBIappointed group is expected to complete the drafting of the Bill shortly.
10229,1997-98,"While FERA is being replaced, we will not let up in our effort to curb the laundering of illgotten money."

10232,1997-98,"The Technology Development Board, established to accelerate the commercialisation of indigenous technology, has identified 16 projects that are commercially viable in the fields of agriculture, health, chemicals and pharmaceuticals."
10233,1997-98,"In 199697, I provided Rs  30 crore to the Technology Development Fund."
10234,1997-98,I propose to increase the allocation in 199798 to Rs  70 crore.
10235,1997-98,A little while ago I made a reference to capital account convertibility.
10236,1997-98,We are proud of our foreign exchange earners.
10237,1997-98,They have been given the facility of the Export Earners Foreign Currency EEFC Account.
10238,1997-98,"At present, the total amount in these accounts is a modest Rs  2000 crore."
10239,1997-98,I propose to expand the scope of the account by allowing the following facilities: 41.capital account convertibility.
10240,1997-98,This is a cherished goal.
10241,1997-98,It is also a matter of great sensitivity.
10242,1997-98,"Hence, I shall not make any commitment."
10243,1997-98,"For the present, I am asking RBI to appoint a group of experts to lay out the road map towards capital account convertibility, prescribe the economic parameters which have to be achieved at each milestone and work out a detailed time table for achieving the goal."
10244,1997-98,I believe the appointment of such a group will send a powerful signal to the world about our determination to join the ranks of the frontline nations.
10245,1997-98,My last budget was viewed in certain quarters as science and technology friendly.
10246,1997-98,"Flattery has its rewards, and I intend to strengthen my friendship with the scientific community."
10247,1997-98,I propose to take the following initiatives: I also believe that the time has come for a preparatory work towards 43.that there is declining interest in the learning of sciences in schools and colleges.
10248,1997-98,I hold the view that an MBA – even if he is from Harvard – is not a patch on a scientist.

10250,1997-98,Outstanding scientists below the age of 45 will be assisted to attain and sustain world class levels in science.
10251,1997-98,A sum of Rs  50 crore in the Department of Education’s budget will be used to create a corpus.
10252,1997-98,The Minister of State for Science and Technology will announce the details of the scheme.
10253,1997-98,Closer linkages have to be developed between Indian industry and publiclyfunded research laboratories.
10254,1997-98,"Hence, I propose to allow government promoted societies recognised by the Department of Science and Industrial Research and notified under the Income Tax Act to invest in the equity of private sector companies."
10255,1997-98,These institutions will invest not money but their knowledge and know how as their equity.
10256,1997-98,Tomorrow’s technology is based on today’s science.
10257,1997-98,I am concerned 10 Information Technology 45.
10258,1997-98,"If there is one science that will dominate the 21st century, it is information technology."
10259,1997-98,"If there is one industry in which India can emerge as a world leader, it is information technology."
10260,1997-98,"However, for this potential to be realised, we need a completely new policy for manufacturing and marketing IT products."
10261,1997-98,"The Electronic Hardware Technology Park EHTP Scheme, presently in force, gives limited flexibility."
10262,1997-98,There is an imperative need to increase production volumes and attract foreign direct investment.
10263,1997-98,"Accordingly, it has been decided that EHTP/ EOU/EPZ units in electronic hardware may be permitted to sell one half of the value of their products, during any 12 month period, in the domestic market and export the other half."
10264,1997-98,"The sale in the domestic market will be on payment of excise duty equivalent to full custom duty, including additional duty of customs."
10265,1997-98,"Details of the new unified manufacturing scheme will be incorporated in the new EXIM policy that will be effective from April 1, 1997."
10266,1997-98,Companies Act and Direct Taxes Act 46.
10267,1997-98,Hon’ble Members will recall that I had set up an expert group to draft a new Companies Bill and another expert committee to prepare a new Direct Taxes Bill.
10268,1997-98,Both groups have done splendid work and have submitted their reports.
10269,1997-98,Copies of the reports will be distributed widely.
10270,1997-98,A working draft of each Bill will also be circulated as soon as it is ready.
10271,1997-98,It is my hope that there will be wide and informed debate on the two Bills.
10272,1997-98,It is my intention to bring the new Companies Bill before this House in the monsoon session and the new Direct Taxes Bill in the winter session.
10273,1997-98,The CMP accords high priority to infrastructure.
10274,1997-98,The India Infrastructure Report has been published and it now remains for us to implement the report.
10275,1997-98,"The critical need is funds, and that too longterm funds."
10276,1997-98,"That is why the CMP said, “There is a strong link between infrastructure development and the financial sectors reforms."
10277,1997-98,Infrastructure needs longterm finances.”
10278,1997-98,Hon’ble Members are fully aware that longterm funds are in the Pension and Insurance sectors.
10279,1997-98,Our foremost companies in the insurance sector are LIC and GIC.
10280,1997-98,"After a long interval of time, LIC and GIC have been given the full complement of Board members."
10281,1997-98,"We have also decided to grant substantial autonomy to LIC and GIC, including the power to make nonscheduled, nonconsortium investments, to determine the terms and conditions of service of their employees and agents, to make regulations and some other powers."
10282,1997-98,LIC and GIC will be further strengthened in due course.
10283,1997-98,"Under the present laws, pension funds are, by an archaic defintion, included in the business of life insurance."
10284,1997-98,"However, it is selfevident that pension and insurance are two different benefits and two different businesses."
10285,1997-98,"While life insurance is the monopoly of LIC, several pension funds have been rightly exempted and allowed to operate independently."
10286,1997-98,"In 1995, at the instance of my distinguished predecessor, UTI floated the UTI Retirement Benefit Plan."
10287,1997-98,"It has attracted about 80,000 subscribers."
10288,1997-98,I propose to allow UTI to expand the above plan into a full fledged pension fund.
10289,1997-98,UTI has made a request to government in this regard; LIC has no objection; and hence it is appropriate to amend the laws.
10290,1997-98,"Similarly, the penetration of health insurance cover in our country is distressingly low."
10291,1997-98,Just about 20 lakh Indians have some kind of health cover.
10292,1997-98,"The Jan Arogya scheme, launched barely six months ago, has already attracted 4 lakh policyholders."
10293,1997-98,"Clearly, there is a demand for health insurance products."
10294,1997-98,GIC has frankly admitted that its Mediclaim policy has not been successful and that it would like to promote joint ventures in this line of business.
10295,1997-98,GIC is also confident of facing competition in the health insurance business.
10296,1997-98,"Accordingly, I propose to move necessary amendments to enable GIC to float joint ventures and also to allow entry of selected Indian players in the health insurance sector."
10297,1997-98,What I have outlined is a very modest opening of one segment of the insurance sector.
10298,1997-98,"LIC will continue to enjoy a monopoly in the life insurance business and GIC will continue to enjoy a monopoly in the nonlife, nonhealth insurance business."
10299,1997-98,"I would also like to make it clear that only a few Indian companies, that is Indiancontrolled and with majority Indian ownership, will be permitted to enter the health insurance business."
10300,1997-98,Comprehensive regulation will be made and enforced by the Insurance Regulatory Authority IRA for all the service providers in the insurance industry.
10301,1997-98,"They will also have to meet the prudential, investment and social norms laid down by the IRA."
10302,1997-98,Phasing out of Ad Hocs 53.
10303,1997-98,Hon’ble Members will recall that in my last Budget speech I had promised to present concrete proposals in this Budget to phase out the system of ad hoc treasury bills by 199798.
10304,1997-98,I am glad to announce that the government and the RBI have worked out the specific measures in this regard.
10305,1997-98,"The system of ad hoc treasury bills to finance the budget deficit will be discontinued with effect from April 1, 1997."
10306,1997-98,A scheme of ways and means advances WMA by the RBI to the Central government is being introduced to accommodate temporary mismatches in the government’s receipts and payments.
10307,1997-98,This will not be a permanent source of financing the government’s deficit.
10308,1997-98,"Besides ways and means advances, RBI’s support will be available for the government’s borrowings programme."
10309,1997-98,Details of the scheme are being separately announced by the RBI.
10310,1997-98,What I am effecting today is a bold and radical change which will strengthen fiscal discipline and provide greater autonomy to RBI in the conduct of the monetary policy.
10311,1997-98,"With the discontinuance of ad hoc treasury bills and tap treasury bills, and the introduction of ways and means advances, the concept of Budget deficit, as currently defined, will lose its relevance either as an indicator of short term requirement of funds by the government or the extent of monetisation."
10312,1997-98,"Therefore, it is proposed to discontinue the practice of showing the ‘Budget deficit’; instead Gross Fiscal Deficit GFD would become the key indicator of deficit."
10313,1997-98,The extent of RBI support to the Central government’s borrowing programme will be shown as “Monetised deficit” in the Budget documents.
10314,1997-98,Several countries have used variety of indexed bonds to provide investors an effective hedge against inflation and to enhance the credibility of antiinflationary policies followed by the government.
10315,1997-98,I believe the time is ripe for India to introduce a capital indexed bond where the repayment of the principal amounts will be indexed to inflation.
10316,1997-98,I have already placed in the House a discussion paper on the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission TFC on the formula to be adopted for devolution of resources from the Centre to the States.
10317,1997-98,The views of the States have been received.
10318,1997-98,The Standing Committee of the InterState Council has also considered the matter.
10319,1997-98,"Based on these consultations, I propose to accept the recommendations of the TFC to form a single, divisible pool of taxes to be shared between the Centre and the States."
10320,1997-98,"To begin with, we shall adopt the proportion of 29% recommended by the TFC."
10321,1997-98,This will be an improvement on the present share of the States.
10322,1997-98,"However, we are willing to discuss the matter further when we bring the Constitution Amendment Bill to give effect to the decision."
10323,1997-98,"We reaffirm our belief that the polity of India requires a strong Centre and strong States and if, I may add, strong local bodies."
10324,1997-98,Revised Estimates for 199697 58.
10325,1997-98,I shall now briefly go over the Revised Estimates Revised Estimates for 199697.
10326,1997-98,"The Budget Estimates for 199697 had placed the total expenditure at Rs  2,04,660 crore."
10327,1997-98,"This is now expected to come down to Rs  2,02,298 crore."
10328,1997-98,"This is the net effect of a decrease of Rs  2,571 crore in nonPlan expenditure and an increase of Rs  209 crore in the Plan expenditure."
10329,1997-98,"NonPlan expenditure in the current year is placed at Rs  1,47,404 crore."
10330,1997-98,"This represents a decrease of Rs  2,571 crore over the Budget Estimates basically on account of saving of Rs  3,000 crore in the provision made for the likely impact of the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission."
10331,1997-98,"On the other hand, we have not got Rs  4,500 crore of the anticipated receipts from disinvestment."
10332,1997-98,"Despite these constraints, I made an additional provision of Rs  1,700 crore for Defence during the year."
10333,1997-98,"On balance, we have managed our receipts and expenditure within the Budget."
10334,1997-98,My greatest satisfaction is on the Plan side.
10335,1997-98,We saved a considerable amount of Plan expenditure of the Central government.
10336,1997-98,"It was, therefore, possible for me to provide an additional Rs  2,500 crore to the States as Additional Central Assistance for externallyaided projects."
10337,1997-98,I also provided Rs  663 crore to Jammu and Kashmir during the year.
10338,1997-98,"As a result, total Plan expenditure has increased by Rs  209 crore."
10339,1997-98,"If I have robbed Peter, the Central government, it is only to pay Paul, the States."
10340,1997-98,"In October, 1996, the Prime Minister announced a package of initiatives for the NorthEast, including adequate funding for ongoing projects, which will require over Rs  6,000 crore."
10341,1997-98,Government will allocate funds for these projects in the Ninth Plan.
10342,1997-98,The Numaligarh Refinery is making good progress.
10343,1997-98,I have provided Rs 100 crore for the project in the RE 199697 and over the next two years adequate funds will be found to ensure its completion on schedule.
10344,1997-98,"The overall gross tax revenue which was estimated at Rs  1,32,145 crore in the Budget estimates will be marginally higher by Rs  174 crore, although the net tax revenue of the Centre would be marginally less by about Rs  100 crore from the Budget estimate of Rs  97,310 crore."
10345,1997-98,"Taking into account the Revised Estimates of revenues and expenditure, the Revenue Deficit has come down from the Budget estimate of 2.5% of GDP to 2.3% of the GDP."
10346,1997-98,There is no change in the Budget estimate of the fiscal deficit which would remain at 5% of the GDP.
10347,1997-98,I am profoundly sorry to disappoint my wellmeaning critics.
10348,1997-98,What will we do without our critics?
10349,1997-98,As Saint Tiruvalluvar said: “Idipparai Illatha Emara Mannan Keduppar Ilanum Kedum” Behold the King who reposeth not on those who can rebuke him/
10350,1997-98,He will perish even when he hath no enemies.

10396,1997-98,PART B Let me preface my tax proposals by saying that I have set for myself the goal of augmenting the net tax revenues of the Central government by a healthy 1516%; I believe that through the measures proposed by me we will attain this goal.
10397,1997-98,I shall begin with my direct tax proposals.
10398,1997-98,The CMP affirms that “the United Front government will continue with tax reforms and take other steps to augment revenues legitimately due to the government and to curb tax evasion.
10399,1997-98,"I believe that a good tax policy should aim at moderate rates, a wider tax base, simpler procedural rules and securing greater compliance."
10400,1997-98,Households and the corporate sector are our best savers; we must reward them.
10401,1997-98,"From another point of view, however, the tax to GDP ratio for the Central government, which currently is only around 10.5 per cent, needs to increase to sustain the needs of public investment and social sector expenditure."
10402,1997-98,"Moreover, the proportion of direct taxes should increase in the total tax revenues of the government."
10403,1997-98,"It is inexplicable that in a country of over 900 million people, only 12 million people are assessed to incometax and, what is worse, only about 12,000 assessees are in the tax bracket of income above Rs  10 lakhs."
10404,1997-98,I intend to make a beginning in widening the tax net by an amendment of Section 139 of the income tax Act.
10405,1997-98,"My proposal is that residents of large metropolitan cities who satisfy any of the two following economic criteria, namely, ownership of a fourwheeler vehicle, occupation of immovable property meeting certain prescribed criteria, ownership of a telephone and foreign travel in the previous year, should normally fall within the taxable slabs and should voluntarily file their tax returns."
10406,1997-98,I appeal to them to cooperate in our endeavour.
10407,1997-98,"If anyone fails to do so, the incometax Department would serve upon him a notice obliging him to file his return so that taxes, if due from him could be collected."
10408,1997-98,Those who live in apparent comfort must have the satisfaction of finding their names in the records of the incometax Department.
10409,1997-98,"With the same objective, I also propose to introduce a new Estimated Income Scheme for retail traders."
10410,1997-98,The scheme will apply to persons engaged in the business of retail trade of any goods or merchandise having a total turnover of less than 40 lakhs.
10411,1997-98,"A trader with a turnover of less than 8 lakhs will stand exempted, given the present exemption limit."
10412,1997-98,The income of the trader will be estimated at 5 per cent of the total turnover.
10413,1997-98,Assessees who file a return showing income less that 5% of turnover will be required to maintain books of account and get their accounts audited.
10414,1997-98,"With the aforesaid steps, the existing presumptive scheme under section 115K, popularly known as Rs  1,400 scheme, which has not yielded the desired results, being discontinued."
10415,1997-98,"Members may recall that, last July, I had reduced the incometax rate for the first income slab from 20 per cent to 15 per cent."
10416,1997-98,"It was, I believe, a step in the right direction."
10417,1997-98,"If we look at comparative incometax slabs in other developing Asian countries, it will be evident that tax rates in India are still high and constitute an important reason for tax evasion."
10418,1997-98,"It is now widely accepted that moderate rates 16 of taxation encourage savings, foster growth and motivate voluntary compliance."
10419,1997-98,I have received wise counsel from many Hon’ble Members.
10420,1997-98,"I have, therefore, decided to lower the rates of personal incometax acrosstheboard in a significant manner."
10421,1997-98,"The current rates of 15, 30 and 40 per cent are being replaced by the new rates of 10, 20 and 30 per cent."
10422,1997-98,"The rate will be 10 per cent in the first slab of Rs  40,000 to Rs  60,000, and 20 per cent in the slab of Rs  60,000 to Rs  1,50,000 and 30 per cent for all income above Rs  1,50,000."
10423,1997-98,The new rates are so moderate that there is now little justification for increasing the exemption limit.
10424,1997-98,"However, salaried persons deserve some relief."
10425,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose to increase the limit of standard deduction to Rs  20,000, which will, henceforth, apply uniformly to all salaried taxpayers."
10426,1997-98,"An employee drawing a salary of Rs  75,000 per annum and contributing 10 per cent thereof to the provident fund would have to pay no tax at all."
10427,1997-98,"During the last meeting of the National Development Council, a suggestion was made that the government should think of a scheme to harness ‘black money’ for productive purposes."
10428,1997-98,I have balanced the economic and the ethical arguments.
10429,1997-98,I have considered various options.
10430,1997-98,And I believe that the time is opportune to introduce a Voluntary Disclosure Scheme.
10431,1997-98,"This would be a simple scheme where, irrespective of the year or the nature or the source of the funds, the amount disclosed, either as cash, securities or assets, whether held in India or abroad, would be charged at the revised highest rate of tax."
10432,1997-98,Interest and penalty will be waived.
10433,1997-98,"Immunity will be granted from any action under the incometax, Wealth tax and Foreign Exchange Regulation Acts."
10434,1997-98,"The date of commencement of the scheme will be notified separately, but the scheme will end on December 31, 1997."
10435,1997-98,"Of the total resources which can be secured under the Scheme, a substantial part – 77.5 per cent – accrue to the State governments."
10436,1997-98,I hope they will cooperate in our endeavour in attracting people to avail of this new opportunity being offered to those who have shied away from paying legitimate taxes in the past.
10437,1997-98,The share which becomes available to the Central government will go entirely towards financing the Basic Minimum Services programme and infrastructure needs.
10438,1997-98,I also propose to give some further relief to our senior citizens.
10439,1997-98,"I propose to increase the rate of rebate available to them to 100 per cent, from the existing 40 per cent, subject to a limit of Rs  10,000."
10440,1997-98,Thus a senior citizen having an income upto Rs  1 lakh would not have to pay any tax.
10441,1997-98,Senior Citizens with higher incomes will also enjoy this exemption limit but will be taxed above the threshold level of upto Rs  1 lakh.
10442,1997-98,"Responding to demands from Chief Ministers, Propose to amend section 80G of the Incometax Act to provide for 100 per cent deduction in respect of donations made to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund or Lieutenant Governor’s Relief Fund."
10443,1997-98,"Turning to corporate taxes, I had in my last budget reduced the rate of surcharge from 15 per cent to 7.5 per cent and had expressed the hope that I would take a similar step in my next budget."
10444,1997-98,I propose to abolish the balance surcharge on companies.
10445,1997-98,Corporates should be encouraged to undertake new investments.
10446,1997-98,"Hence, 17 I propose to reduce the tax rate applicable to both domestic and foreign companies."
10447,1997-98,The rate for domestic companies will now be 35 per cent and for foreign companies 48 per cent.
10448,1997-98,"The reduction in the corporate rates, apart from better compliance, should impart an added momentum to the growth process, create multiplier beneficial effects all around and also attract greater foreign investment."
10449,1997-98,There has also been a demand from the corporate sector that the tax rate of 30 per cent on royalty and technical services fees payable to foreign companies is too high and acts as a hindrance to the transfer of technology.
10450,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose to reduce this rate to 20 per cent."
10451,1997-98,I have received requests from nonresident Indians that the capital gains tax rate in their case arising on transfer of securities should be at par with the rate applicable in the case of FIIs.
10452,1997-98,"I see merit in their demand and, accordingly, propose that the rate be reduced from the existing 20 per cent to 10 per cent."
10453,1997-98,"The Minimum Alternate Tax MAT on companies, which was introduced last year, has been the subject of extensive debate."
10454,1997-98,A large number of representations have been received to repeal – or review – the provisions.
10455,1997-98,"The economic rationale for MAT has, I am afraid, not been altered and I am unable to accept the request that the provision introduced last year be totally withdrawn."
10456,1997-98,"However, there is a case for a review of the manner in which the tax is charged and collected."
10457,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose to make the following changes in the provisions of MAT: i Export profits will be exempt from MAT and will be eligible for full deduction under section 80HHC."
10458,1997-98,A system of credit will be introduced in respect of the payment of MAT.
10459,1997-98,"When a company pays MAT, the tax credit earned by it shall be allowed to be carried forward for a period of 5 assessment years and, in the assessment year when regular tax becomes payable, the difference between the regular tax and tax computed under MAT for that year will be set off against the MAT credit available."
10460,1997-98,"Thus, at the proposed new rate of corporate tax, every company including the zero tax companies, would have to pay incometax of not less than 10.5 per cent on its book profits."
10461,1997-98,Another area of vigorous debate over many years relates to the issue of tax on dividends.
10462,1997-98,I wish to end this debate.
10463,1997-98,"Hence, I propose to abolish tax on dividends in the hands of the shareholder."
10464,1997-98,Some companies distribute exorbitant dividends.
10465,1997-98,"Ideally, they should retain bulk of their profits and plough them into fresh investments."
10466,1997-98,I intend to reward companies who invest in future growth.
10467,1997-98,"Hence, I propose to levy a tax on distributed profits at the moderate rate of 10 per cent on the amount so distributed."
10468,1997-98,This tax shall be incidence on the company and shall not be passed on the shareholder.
10469,1997-98,"In order to encourage investments in government securities, called gilts, I propose to abolish Tax Deducted at Source TDS on such securities."
10470,1997-98,"I also propose to include gilts for the higher deduction limit of Rs  15,000 under section 80L of the Incometax Act as is available in respect of income received from the units of UTI or approved mutual funds."
10471,1997-98,I have already announced that Telecommunication will qualify as infrastructure.
10472,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose to extend the following benefits to this sector: i Tax holiday under section 80 IA; ii Amortisation of license fees; and iii Inclusion of investment made in debentures and equity shares of a public company providing telecommunication services for the purposes of tax rebate under section 88."
10473,1997-98,"In order to encourage the development of tourism infrastructure, I propose to give a deduction of 50 per cent of the profits in respect of new hotels which are located in a hilly area or a place of pilgrimage or a specified place of tourist importance."
10474,1997-98,These hotels will also be exempt from the levy of expenditure tax.
10475,1997-98,"In respect of hotels located in other places, excluding the four metropolitan cities, the deduction shall be only 30 per cent of the profits."
10476,1997-98,Taxing financial itermediation goes contrary to the canons of sound public finance.
10477,1997-98,"Today, an interesttax at the rate of 3 per cent is levied on the interest income of lending institutions, including banks and NBFCs."
10478,1997-98,I propose to reduce the levy to 2 per cent and I hope to eliminate this levy progressively.
10479,1997-98,This will help to keep down the cost of borrowing.
10480,1997-98,"As a measure of simplification, I propose to amend Section 37 of the Incometax Act to provide for the removal of artificial disallowance on account of advertisement, travelling, hotel expenses, entertainment expenses etc. incurred for legitimate business purposes."
10481,1997-98,I have also decided to eliminate a number of exemptions which continue to remain on statute book and have since lost their relevance or rationale.
10482,1997-98,"These include exemptions and deductions under sections 1015A, 1026AA, 80GG and 80JJ."
10483,1997-98,"Now, I turn to my indirect tax proposals."
10484,1997-98,In relation to indirect taxes the CMP has stipulated: “The progress towards the goal of bringing India’s tariffs in accord with world levels will be measure and calibrated.”
10485,1997-98,"On more than one occasion, I have stated that we would achieve the average levels of tariffs prevalent in ASEAN countries by the turn of the century."
10486,1997-98,This will give time to Indian industry to adjust to these changes.
10487,1997-98,This year’s proposals should be seen in this background.
10488,1997-98,I propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 50% to 40% 112.
10489,1997-98,High levels of customs duties on capital good are inconsistent with our policy of attracting the best technology.
10490,1997-98,Greenfield investments in large projects should be globally competitive.
10491,1997-98,I have tried to harmonise the needs of the Indian industry with the requirements of the capital goods sector.
10492,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose a modest reduction in duty on capital goods from 25% to 20%."
10493,1997-98,This reduced rate of 20% will also apply to project imports.
10494,1997-98,Over the next two to three years these rates 19 would need to be further adjusted to conform to levels prevalent in other developing Asian countries.
10495,1997-98,"I also propose to exempt plans, designs and drawings from the levy of customs duty."
10496,1997-98,The customs duty on several inputs for the steel industry is being reduced.
10497,1997-98,"I propose to reduce the duty on coking coal of ash content below 12% from 5% to 3% and on coking coal of higher ash content, as well as coke, from 20% to 10%."
10498,1997-98,"I also propose to reduce the duty on nickel from 20% to 10%, on ferro alloys from 25% to 20% and on rerollable steel scrap from 30% to 20%."
10499,1997-98,All these measures should benefit the steel industry to reduce its cost of production.
10500,1997-98,Iron and steel products at present generally attract customs duty at 30%.
10501,1997-98,I do not propose to make any major changes in the duty structure this year.
10502,1997-98,"However, I propose to reduce the duty on Cold Rolled Coils of iron and steel from 30% to 25% to help the engineering industry."
10503,1997-98,I further propose to reduce the duty on ships brought for breaking from 10% to 5% and on pig iron from 20% to 10%.
10504,1997-98,I propose to reduce the duty on noncoking coal from 20% to 10%.
10505,1997-98,This will help the power sector.
10506,1997-98,Chemicals constitute vital inputs for several downstream industries including the small scale sector.
10507,1997-98,I propose to reduce the duty on organic and inorganic chemicals from 40% to 30%.
10508,1997-98,I also propose to make the following reductions on certain essential chemicals: ·
10509,1997-98,"On linear alkylbenzene, from 30% to 20%. ·"
10510,1997-98,"On methanol, from 30% to 20%. ·"
10511,1997-98,"On naphthalene, from 30% to 20%. ·"
10512,1997-98,"On phenol, from 30% to 25%. ·"
10513,1997-98,"On catalysts, from 30% to 25%."
10514,1997-98,"I also propose to reduce the customs duty on dyes, pigments, paints and varnishes, glues, enzymes and modified starches from 40% to 30%."
10515,1997-98,These reductions will significantly benefit our textile industry.
10516,1997-98,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the scheduled dismantling of quantitative restrictions under the Multi Fibre Agreement will expose all textile exporting countries to stiff competition."
10517,1997-98,The Ministry of Textiles have created a “Technology Upgradation Fund” for both the textile and jute industries to enhance the competitive efficiency of these sectors.
10518,1997-98,"Our textile industry has, therefore, to upgrade its technologies in the shortest possible time."
10519,1997-98,"Last year, I had reduced the customs duty on several kinds of textile machinery to 10%."
10520,1997-98,"In order to improve the quality of our garments for exports, this year I propose to ad some more processing machines to this category."
10521,1997-98,"However, to mitigate any adverse impact on domestic manufacturers, I have decided to allow them to import the components and parts of these machinery at a concessional duty of 10%."
10522,1997-98,"As a relief to the woolen textile industry, I propose to reduce the import duty on apparel grade wool from 25% to 20%, on wool waste from 30% to 20% and on woolen and synthetic rags from 30% to 25%."
10523,1997-98,"On flax fibre, I propose to reduce the duty from 30% to 20%."
10524,1997-98,"In order to conserve our forest resources, I propose to fully exempt wood logs, fuel wood, wood chips, etc. from customs duty."
10525,1997-98,The spread of “Information Technology” has radically altered conventional wisdom on growth strategies.
10526,1997-98,I propose several measures to encourage this industry and to reduce costs.
10527,1997-98,These include: · Full exemption to computer software.
10528,1997-98,"Reduction on duty on computer parts, other than populated printed circuit boards from 20% to 10%."
10529,1997-98,Reduction of duty on cartridge tape drive and digital video disc drive from 20% to 10%.
10530,1997-98,Reduction on · Reduction on · Reduction on · Reduction on duty on populated printed circuit boards from 30% to 20%.
10531,1997-98,Reduction on duty on parts of cellular telephones and pagers from 30% to 20%.
10532,1997-98,Reduction on duty on telecom equipment from 40% to 30% and on their parts from 30% to 20%.
10533,1997-98,"Ham operators are presently eligible to import specified equipment upto a value of Rs  50,000 at a concessional rate of duty."
10534,1997-98,"I propose to raise this limit to Rs  75,000."
10535,1997-98,I propose to reduce the duty on watch parts and movements from 50% to 25% and on watch cases of base metals from 50% to 30%.
10536,1997-98,I also propose to reduce duty on horological materials from 20% to 10%.
10537,1997-98,This will help our watch industry to further enhance their quality.
10538,1997-98,We are all concerned about the menace of growing pollution.
10539,1997-98,"In order to help reduce the cost of CNG kits, I have decided to reduce the customs duty on such kits and their parts from 10% to a modest 5%."
10540,1997-98,"Similarly, I propose to reduce the customs duty on catalytic converters and their parts to 5% from their existing rate of 25%."
10541,1997-98,"To improve the quality of medical care, I propose to reduce the import duty on medical equipment from 30% to 20%; on linear accelerators of 15 MeV and above used for cancer treatment from 10% to 0%; and on ophthalmic blanks for making spectacle lenses from 50% to 20%."
10542,1997-98,"To promote tourism, I propose to reduce the import duty on specified equipment required for hotels from 35% to 25% and on specified specialty food items used by foreign tourists from 50% to 25%."
10543,1997-98,I also propose to give some relief to the film and photographic industry by reducing the import duty on cine films and other photographic films from 30% to 25% and on parts of cameras from 50% to 25%.
10544,1997-98,I propose to reduce the customs duty on baggage from 60% to 50%.
10545,1997-98,I now come to proposals on central excise.
10546,1997-98,Our excise structure is far too complex.
10547,1997-98,"Till some time ago, we had a multiplicity of rates, innumerable enduse exemptions and other distortions."
10548,1997-98,Considerable simplification has taken place.
10549,1997-98,"Last July, I promised that within three years we shall have a four rate tax structure."
10550,1997-98,"I find that, in the first instance, it is necessary to reduce the dispersion in excise rates."
10551,1997-98,I believe that we can eventually gravitate towards a mean rate around 18%.
10552,1997-98,"With this objective in view, I have introduced three new rates, namely, 8% 13% and 18%."
10553,1997-98,In the process I have done away with the rates of 20% and 10% except in the case of some petroleum products.
10554,1997-98,"In the interest of revenue, I have perforce to continue, for the time being, the rate of 15% which will apply to metals and a few other commodities."
10555,1997-98,"However, the excise duty structure is still punctuated with many exemptions."
10556,1997-98,"All commodities, with some unavoidable exceptions, should be subject to excise duty at minimum rate."
10557,1997-98,I propose to undertake this exercise in the next year’s budget.
10558,1997-98,Cotton yarn will continue to bear excise duty of 5% only.
10559,1997-98,"I propose to withdraw the exemption in a few cases like jams, jellies, sauces and soups where I propose to impose a nominal duty of 8% ."
10560,1997-98,"Similarly, I propose to levy a duty of 8% on pens and ball point pens exceeding a value of Rs  100 per piece and on nonpower sun glasses."
10561,1997-98,"However, writing ink will be free from excise duty."
10562,1997-98,"On a number of items of mass consumption like biscuits, sugar confectionery, laundry soap, tooth paste, tooth powder, kitchen and tableware of glass, and clocks and watches of a value upto Rs  600 per piece, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 10% to 8%."
10563,1997-98,"A rate of 13% would be applied for watches and clocks above Rs  600 per piece and other items machinery and parts, tyres and tubes of twowheeled motor vehicles, fluorescent tubes, and computers and parts thereof."
10564,1997-98,"A reduced rate of 13% will also apply to Xray films, sanitary towels, napkins for babies and similar sanitary articles."
10565,1997-98,"In respect of a large number of products, I propose to reduce the excise duty by percentages ranging from 2% to 7% and apply the mean rate."
10566,1997-98,"Accordingly, the mean rate of 18% would be applicable to many commodities including cocoa and cocoa preparations, instant coffee, sherbats, organic and inorganic chemicals, paints and dyes, electric wires and cables, toilet soaps, detergents, articles of leather, synthetic rubber, fibres and blended synthetic yarn, paper and paper board, plywood, travel goods and a host of consumer durables."
10567,1997-98,Agricultural and horticultural machinery are fully exempt from excise duty.
10568,1997-98,"I propose to extend the exemption from excise duty to milking machines, dairy machines and their parts."
10569,1997-98,"In order to revive and give a thrust to the ailing jute industry, I propose to fully exempt all jute and jute products from excise duty."
10570,1997-98,"At present, import of equipment and consumables by recognized research 22 institutions is exempt from customs duty."
10571,1997-98,"In the interest of the domestic producer, I propose to allow the purchase of indigenous equipment and consumables by such institutions free of excise duty."
10572,1997-98,I also propose to reduce the duties of excise on certain items in order to bring about a more balanced excise structure on the whole.
10573,1997-98,The changes proposed are: · Reduction of duty on taxis and cars for physically handicapped from 30% to 25%.
10574,1997-98,Reduction of duty on polyester filament yarn from 40% to 30%.
10575,1997-98,Reduction of duty on cosmetics and toilet preparations from 40% to 30%.
10576,1997-98,Reduction of duty on glazed tiles from 30% to 25%.
10577,1997-98,Reduction of duty on air conditioner from 40% to 30%.
10578,1997-98,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, smoking in public places is banned in Delhi."
10579,1997-98,The fight against cancer and respiratory diseases continues.
10580,1997-98,"My contribution will be to increase the excise duty on nonfilter cigarettes, not exceeding 60mm in length, popularly called mini cigarettes, from Rs  75 per thousand to Rs  90 per thousand."
10581,1997-98,I have also increased the duty on other categories of cigarettes.
10582,1997-98,The increase range from Rs  20 to Rs  70 per thousand.
10583,1997-98,There has been no increase in the excise duty on biris since 1995.
10584,1997-98,"I, therefore, propose to increase the excise duty on biris from Rs  5 per thousand to Rs  6 per thousand."
10585,1997-98,The impact of this duty change on the retail price would be only 2 paise for a bundle of 20 biris.
10586,1997-98,"As regards cigarettes, the increase would be 15 times more for every mini cigarette."
10587,1997-98,"The small scale sector makes an important contribution to our overall production, provides gainful employment and also contributes to our export effort."
10588,1997-98,It is the declared policy of this Government to free the small scale industry from the rigours of cumbersome procedures.
10589,1997-98,"In line with this objective, I have radically simplified the scheme of excise duty concessions for the small scale units."
10590,1997-98,"I intend to continue the full exemption for duty on clearances upto Rs  30 lakhs and upto Rs  100 lakhs, if the small scale unit does not avail any modvat credit on duty paid inputs."
10591,1997-98,The flat rate of duty will be 3% advalorem on clearances between Rs  30 to Rs  50 lakhs and 3% advalorem on clearances between Rs  50 to Rs  100 lakhs.
10592,1997-98,The flat rate will apply for all specified goods to which the small scale exemption is applicable.
10593,1997-98,"In the revised scheme of exemption, the small scale units will not be required to maintain complicated records for availing modvat."
10594,1997-98,They will also not be required to determine the classification of goods.
10595,1997-98,"In order to curb avoidance from payment of duty, I have decided to exclude a few items like cotton yarn and texturised manmade yarn from the purview of the SSI exemption scheme."
10596,1997-98,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, while it is our policy to moderate the tax rates and simplify procedures, the government is equally committed to curb evasion of taxes."
10597,1997-98,"It is reported that in some sectors, like induction furnace, steel rerolling mills etc., evasion of excise duty is substantial and the production is not being reported correctly."
10598,1997-98,I propose to tackle this problem by introducing collection of excise duty 23 on the basis of their production capacity.
10599,1997-98,Suitable legislative changes in the excise law for enabling the implementation of the aforesaid changes are under consideration.
10600,1997-98,The details of the proposals would be submitted to this House in due course.
10601,1997-98,The average citizen consumes a basket of commodities.
10602,1997-98,As a result of my proposals – some increases and many reductions – I believe the basket will carry a significantly lower tax burden.
10603,1997-98,The services sector contributes nearly 40% of the GDP.
10604,1997-98,"Hence, I propose to extend the service tax to cover a number of well known services like: · Transportation of goods by road; · Consulting engineers; · Custom house, Steamer and Clearing and Forwarding agents; · Air travel agents, tour operators and car rental agencies; · Outdoor caterers, pandal contractors and mandap keepers; · Manpower recruitment agencies."
10605,1997-98,"The proposals on service tax are estimated to yield a revenue of Rs  1,200 crore in a full year."
10606,1997-98,"However, for the financial year 199798, I am taking credit for Rs  900 crore."
10607,1997-98,"I wish to inform the House that in order to improve our national highways, I propose to utilise the bulk of the proceeds realised from service tax on transportation of goods by road to augment the resources of the National Highway Authority."
10608,1997-98,"On the conventional basis, my proposals relating to reduction in customs duties are estimated to result in a loss of Rs  2,625 crore in a financial year and, in the case of excise duties, my proposals are broadly revenue neutral."
10609,1997-98,"However, the buoyancy and the growth momentum that would be imparted to the economy would more than compensate for our losses computed through the conventional calculations."
10610,1997-98,I now have to say something on behalf of my colleague the Minister of Communications who has made a statement earlier today.
10611,1997-98,A revision of tariffs for some postal services has become unavoidable.
10612,1997-98,"However, in doing so, we have kept in view the interest of the common man and the role of postal services in meeting wider social obligations."
10613,1997-98,"While there is no change for Registered Newspapers, the price for ordinary Post Card is being raised to 25 paise and printed Post Card to Rs  1.50."
10614,1997-98,The price for Inland Letter is also being raised from 75 paise to Re. 1 and for Envelope from Re. 1 to Rs  2.
10615,1997-98,Certain other changes are also being effected which is explained in the memorandum circulated alongwith the budget documents.
10616,1997-98,The changes will take effect from a date to be notified later.
10617,1997-98,The proposed revisions are estimated o yield an additional revenue of Rs  367 crore in a full year and Rs  305 crore during 199798.
10618,1997-98,This modest increase is necessary for the development of postal services and in partially bridging the deficit on the numerous services being provided by the Postal Department.
10619,1997-98,Copies of the notifications giving effect to the above changes in customs and excise will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
10620,1997-98,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, as I come to the end of my labours, let me look at the final 24 outcome."
10621,1997-98,"The revenue deficit in 199798 is placed at Rs  30,266 crore or 2.1% of GDP."
10622,1997-98,"The fiscal deficit comes to Rs  65,454 crore which is 4.5% of GDP."
10623,1997-98,I have not wavered in my commitment to continue on the course of fiscal correction.
10624,1997-98,"With the support of this House, and as I promised in the CMP, I hope to bring the fiscal deficit under 4% in the next budget."
10625,1997-98,"Our goal must be to achieve rapid and broadbased growth which alone can ensure higher employment, better living standards and a humane and just society."
10626,1997-98,The challenges that we face today are not unique to India.
10627,1997-98,"Other countries, including our friends in Asia, have faced similar challenges."
10628,1997-98,Other Asian countries are surging ahead.
10629,1997-98,"And, finally, there is the example of China, powering its way to becoming the second largest economy in the world."
10630,1997-98,"These countries have shown that with courage, wisdom and pragmatism they can find their rightful places in the world."
10631,1997-98,"Deng Xiao Peng, to whom we paid homage a few days ago, once said, “From our experience of these last few years, I is entirely possible for economic development to reach a new stage every few years."
10632,1997-98,Development is the only hard truth.”
10633,1997-98,India’s economy has also reached a new stage.
10634,1997-98,Our beloved India is far stronger today than she was six years ago.
10635,1997-98,"I would appeal to this House, and to the Indian people to heed the call of Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore:"
10636,1997-98,"Desha desha nadita kari mandrita tabha bheri, Aashilo jata birabrinda aashana tabha gheri."
10637,1997-98,"Deen aagata oyi, Bharat tabu kayi?Shay ki rahila lupta aaji shabajanapaschatay?"
10638,1997-98,Louk bishwakarmabhar mili shabar shathay Thy call has sped over all countries of the world And men have gathered around thy seat.
10639,1997-98,"The day is come; but where is India?Does she still remain hidden, lagging behind?"
10640,1997-98,Let her take up her burden and march with all.
10641,1997-98,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to this august House."
10642,1998-99,I rise to present the budget for the year 199899.
10643,1998-99,This is the first budget of the Government led by Prime Minister Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
10644,1998-99,It is a defining moment in history.
10645,1998-99,It is an occasion fraught with expectation.
10646,1998-99,I am very grateful to the Prime Minister for the confidence he has reposed in me and the guidance he has given me.
10647,1998-99,It has been just over ten weeks since this Government took office.
10648,1998-99,But we know already that a new India is rising.
10649,1998-99,"And as May 11 was surely the first step, today is yet another."
10650,1998-99,"Certainly, a long journey lies ahead, but as history will prove, we have now begun to build a new India."
10651,1998-99,"This will be a strong and prosperous India  a nation selfreliant, but not autarchic, rather a nation keen to deal with the world as an equal partner with other countries."
10652,1998-99,"As the saying goes, “only the strong can be free."
10653,1998-99,And only the productive can be strong”.
10654,1998-99,This is the new India we propose to build.
10655,1998-99,The dimensions of the economic challenges that confront us today have come into sharper focus since the time I presented the interim budget before this House.
10656,1998-99,"While the people of India have reacted with pride over the events of May 11, some of our friends abroad have responded negatively."
10657,1998-99,"I am confident that these initial negative responses will be moderated as our position gets better understood, and will not have any significant impact on our economic development."
10658,1998-99,"On our part, our policies have to be clearly directed and firm."
10659,1998-99,As Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore said “You cannot cross the sea by standing and staring at the water”.
10660,1998-99,We intend to cross the sea and I seek the cooperation of this august House in this national endeavour in the weeks and months ahead.
10661,1998-99,In preparing this budget I have been guided by the famous talisman of Gandhiji.
10662,1998-99,I have recalled to myself the face of the poorest and the weakest man I have seen and made sure that this budget is of use to him.
10663,1998-99,This budget is rooted in Swadeshi which will be unfolded as we go along.
10664,1998-99,"But I shall hasten to add that Swadeshi does not mean isolation, Swadeshi means making India strong and self reliant so that we can compete with the world and win."
10665,1998-99,"As our courageous Prime Minister has himself said : ÉÊãÉaÉÉ cÉlÉ àÉå v ́ÉVÉ BÉE£ÉÉÒ xÉÉ ZÉÖBÉEäMÉÉ, BÉEnàÉ ¤ÉfÃ ®cÉ cè BÉE£ÉÉÒ xÉÉ °ôBÉEäMÉÉ* Flag we hold shall never bow, Marching steps shall never halt."
10666,1998-99,"A few days ago the Economic Survey, 199798 was tabled in Parliament."
10667,1998-99,It provides a comprehensive analysis of the economy’s performance during 199798.
10668,1998-99,"In my interim budget speech I had already drawn attention to some disquieting trends: overall economic growth slowed to 5 per cent in 199798; agricultural growth was negative, with foodgrain production dropping to194 million tonnes from199 million tonnes in the previous year; growth of industrial production slackened to 4.2 per cent; export performance was weak for a second successive year, recording growth in dollar terms of less than 3 per cent; the fiscal deficit worsened to 6.1 per cent of GDP; the capital market remained in the doldrums and infrastructure bottlenecks continued to plague the economy."
10669,1998-99,But I am not daunted by the situation.
10670,1998-99,"Only the weak are tamed by adversity, the strong rise above them."
10671,1998-99,"Drawing on the National Agenda for Governance and policy statements of the Prime Minister, I believe the key objectives of this budget should be to: * Strengthen the foundations of the Indian economy to deal effectively with an inherently uncertain external environment."
10672,1998-99,Reverse the decline in agriculture and strengthen the rural economy.
10673,1998-99,"Restore the momentum of industrial growth, especially of small scale enterprises, and revive the capital market."
10674,1998-99,Accelerate the development of infrastructure.
10675,1998-99,"By these and other means, rapidly expand productive job opportunities."
10676,1998-99,"Calibrate the pace and character of integration with the world economy, while strengthening India’s international economic position through revival of exports and reduced reliance on borrowed funds."
10677,1998-99,Ensure macroeconomic stability and control over inflation.
10678,1998-99,Raise the rate of domestic savings to achieve higher national investment and thus lay the basis for faster mediumterm growth.
10679,1998-99,Supplement this effort through foreign investment.
10680,1998-99,"As I stand here and address this august House, my thoughts wander naturally to the remote villages of India and to millions of our toiling farmers."
10681,1998-99,I have no doubt in my mind that the health and dynamism of the rural economy is central to India’s economic and social development.
10682,1998-99,I propose to do the following for agriculture and rural development: *
10683,1998-99,Water is a critical input for agriculture.
10684,1998-99,"Yet, after all these years of development only 37 per cent of our cultivable area is under assured irrigation."
10685,1998-99,The bulk of our poor people live in rainfed areas.
10686,1998-99,We propose to accord top priority for development of rainfed areas on a watershed basis and thereby enhance agricultural productivity in a sustainable manner.
10687,1998-99,"Watershed Development Programmes, currently spread across several ministries and departments, will be unified and the plan allocation stepped up to Rs 677 crore from Rs 517 crore in RE 199798."
10688,1998-99,"Furthermore, there is an increase in the provision for the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme by 58 per cent over 199798."
10689,1998-99,Next only to water is the question of rural credit and rural infrastructure.
10690,1998-99,Under the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF managed by NABARD moneys are made available to the State Governments for rural infrastructure.
10691,1998-99,"During the past three years about Rs  2,500 crore has been allocated to it annually."
10692,1998-99,"I am pleased to announce RIDF IV with an enhanced allocation of Rs 3,000 crore."
10693,1998-99,I invite the States to come forward to utilise this important facility.
10694,1998-99,I propose to augment NABARD’s share capital by Rs 500 crore in the current year.
10695,1998-99,Government will allocate Rs 100 crore from the budget and the RBI will contribute the balance of Rs 400 crore.
10696,1998-99,This will enable NABARD to leverage additional resource from the market to meet the credit needs of agriculture.
10697,1998-99,The problem of rural unemployment and underemployment is a massive one.
10698,1998-99,This can only be solved through selfemployment.
10699,1998-99,"There is no reason why every craftsman, artisan and weaver cannot become an entrepreneur and run his own little enterprise."
10700,1998-99,A major bottleneck however has been lack of credit facilities.
10701,1998-99,Earlier NABARD had launched a limited scheme for promotion of Self Help Groups SHG as a channel for the flow of funds to the micro enterprises.
10702,1998-99,I am asking NABARD to greatly extend the scope and coverage of the scheme so that 2 lakh Self Help Groups covering 40 lakh families can be assisted over the next five years through this scheme of micro credit.
10703,1998-99,The Reserve Bank of India is also advising commercial banks to design specific loan package to meet the needs of micro enterprises.
10704,1998-99,"I have asked the National Housing Bank to finance one lakh rural dwelling units under the Swarna Jayanti Housing Finance Scheme as against 50,000 units last year."
10705,1998-99,"Sponsor banks are being given an enlarged role in providing management, operational and restructuring support to RRBs."
10706,1998-99,They are even committed to civil prison for this default.
10707,1998-99,"While the repayment culture must improve, this government is determined to create conditions so that no farmer goes to jail for a loan repayment default or is forced to commit suicide."
10708,1998-99,The Reserve Bank will be issuing appropriate guidelines to the banks for hasslefree settlement of old cases of overdues.
10709,1998-99,Banks will be encouraged to provide appropriate relief on accumulated interest in deserving cases.
10710,1998-99,The new procedure should also help in reducing the outstanding volume of NonPerforming Assets NPAs of the banking sector.
10711,1998-99,"NABARD is being asked to formulate a model scheme for issue of Kisan Credit Cards to farmers on the basis of their holdings for uniform adoption by the banks so that the farmers may use them to readily purchase agricultural inputs such as seeds, fertilisers, pesticides etc. and draw cash for their production needs."
10712,1998-99,"The ingenuity and enterprise of our farmers is today hamstrung by numerous Central and State laws and regulations relating to the production, marketing and movement of agricultural commodities."
10713,1998-99,"My colleague, the Minister of State for Agriculture, will soon be bringing out, under the guidance of the Prime Minister, the Government’s National Agricultural Policy paper which will address these constraints in a comprehensive manner."
10714,1998-99,The Minister of Commerce is systematically reviewing existing controls on exports of all agricultural commodities except foodgrains.
10715,1998-99,There is no reason why our farmers should not reap the benefits of access to wider global markets.
10716,1998-99,The system of agricultural cooperatives in our country is plagued by bureaucracy and political interference at many levels.
10717,1998-99,"As part of a concerted programme to revitalise the cooperative sector, government will shortly bring forward a model cooperative law to replace the MultiState Cooperative Societies Act of 1984 and will encourage the States to make similar amendments in their own acts."
10718,1998-99,"There has been a long standing demand from our farmers and the Ministry of Agriculture for the exclusion of farm implements and tools from the list of items reserved for manufacture by the SSI sector, so that farmers can benefit from a wider range of implements and tools at competitive prices and with requisite after sales service."
10719,1998-99,This proposal had also been recommended by the Advisory Committee of the Ministry of Industry.
10720,1998-99,Government have decided to accept this recommendation.
10721,1998-99,India has made commendable progress in oilseeds production in recent years.
10722,1998-99,"In order to establish an efficient market environment and to reduce volatility in prices in this sector, the government is planning to introduce futures trading in edible oilseeds, their oils and their cakes."
10723,1998-99,The existing subsidy schemes for both urea and decontrolled phosphatic and potassic fertilisers are being continued.
10724,1998-99,"However, for achieving optimum crop response ratio to fertiliser use, the use of all the three nutrients, nitrogen N, phosphorus P and potassium K should be balanced."
10725,1998-99,This balance has been progressively distorted over time because of the low price of urea compared with decontrolled fertilisers.
10726,1998-99,"The NPK balance, which was 5.9:2.4:1 in 199192, had 5 changed adversely to 10:2.9:1 by 199697."
10727,1998-99,An increase in the price of urea would help restore this balance.
10728,1998-99,"The increase is also justified on the ground of rising costs, which have led to a more than 50 per cent increase in the subsidy on indigenously produced urea in two years between 199596 and RE 199798."
10729,1998-99,"It is, therefore, proposed to increase the selling price of urea by Re.1 per kilogram with immediate effect."
10730,1998-99,Government is committed to provide safe drinking water to all rural habitations in the next five years.
10731,1998-99,"To achieve this ambitious target, a multi pronged approach to rural water supply is being adopted: *"
10732,1998-99,"The allocation for the Accelerated Rural Water Supply Programme is being enhanced from Rs 1,302 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 1,627 crore in this regular budget."
10733,1998-99,This enhanced outlay will cover about one lakh habitations.
10734,1998-99,"As mentioned earlier, we will give a special thrust to Watershed Development Programmes."
10735,1998-99,This will also ensure better results for ground water availability and conservation.
10736,1998-99,"States are being encouraged to institutionalise communitybased rural water supply programmes, which secure active participation of beneficiaries to own, operate and maintain rural water supply facilities."
10737,1998-99,"Over the years, programmes for alleviation of poverty and employment generation have proliferated."
10738,1998-99,"Each scheme is well intentioned but their multiplicity has led to needless duplication, high overhead costs, confusion at field levels and insufficient benefit to the people."
10739,1998-99,It is proposed to unify the various programmes under two broad categories of Self Employment Schemes and Wage Employment Schemes.
10740,1998-99,Funding and organisational patterns will be rationalised to achieve maximum beneficial impact of these programmes.
10741,1998-99,"The SSI sector makes a valuable contribution of about 40 per cent to our total manufacturing sector production, 35 per cent to exports and employs over 160 lakh workers."
10742,1998-99,Our commitment to the SSI sector is total.
10743,1998-99,The commonest complaint of SSI entrepreneurs and associations are the insufficiency of timely credit and the harassment of the “Inspector Raj”.
10744,1998-99,"On the credit problems of the SSI sector, I propose the following initiatives: *"
10745,1998-99,"At present, for SSI units having aggregate working capital requirements up to Rs 2 crore, the working capital limit is determined by the banks on the basis of a simple calculation of 20 per cent of their annual turnover."
10746,1998-99,This facility is being doubled to Rs 4 crore.
10747,1998-99,This will ease the flow of bank credit to SSI.
10748,1998-99,"To moderate the cost of credit to SSI units, RBI will advise the banks to accord SSI units with a good track record, the benefit of lower spreads over the prime lending rate."
10749,1998-99,"To equip SIDBI to play its apex role in SSI credit provision more effectively, SIDBI will be delinked from IDBI and IDBI shareholding in SFCs will be transferred to SIDBI."
10750,1998-99,SSI units are often handicapped by delays in the settlement of their dues from larger companies.
10751,1998-99,"To tackle this problem, I am asking RBI to strengthen the existing mechanisms available to SSI for discounting of bills."
10752,1998-99,RBI will also modify its guidelines to commercial banks on credit appraisal to give greater weight to the amount of overdue outstandings that large units have in respect of SSI supplier.
10753,1998-99,"My colleague, the Minister of Industry is separately bringing amendments in the Interest on Delayed Payments to Small Scale and Ancillary Industry Undertaking Act,1993 to make the existing legislation more effective."
10754,1998-99,"As for the pervasive problem of the “Inspector Raj”, I shall be announcing far reaching changes in the administration of Central Excise which should help SSI units significantly."
10755,1998-99,I urge all States to review their laws and regulations and make necessary changes to lighten the burden of the inspector raj problem of SSI units.
10756,1998-99,I shall also be announcing some tax concessions to the SSI sector later in my speech.
10757,1998-99,Private Investment in Industry 2 0 .
10758,1998-99,"The government accords high priority to boosting private investment, including foreign investment, in industry."
10759,1998-99,We must minimise bureaucratic and procedural hurdles and create an investor friendly environment.
10760,1998-99,Industrial licensing was abolished in most industrial sectors as part of the economic reforms.
10761,1998-99,"On reviewing the remaining handful of licensed sectors, the government have further decided to delicense coal and lignite and petroleum products."
10762,1998-99,Industrial deregulation would remain incomplete without reducing the burdens imposed by the “Inspector Raj”.
10763,1998-99,The majority of inspectors operate under State level statutes.
10764,1998-99,Government have initiated a dialogue with the State Governments to explore the consolidation of regulatory legislation relating to industry and exchange of best practices across States in carrying out the necessary inspections in the least burdensome way.
10765,1998-99,I will return to this subject when I present my excise proposals.
10766,1998-99,The Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB has done a good job in promoting foreign investment and streamlining the procedures at the Central government level.
10767,1998-99,Foreign investment flows have increased substantially and were estimated to be $3.1 billion in 199798.
10768,1998-99,About 60 per cent of investment approvals are in the energy and infrastructure sectors.
10769,1998-99,It will be our objective to create conditions in which foreign investors will find India an attractive investment destination.
10770,1998-99,We hope to double the inflow of foreign direct investment within two years.
10771,1998-99,Foreign investors are frequently inhibited by lack of familiarity with our systems and statutes and particular problems at the State level.
10772,1998-99,"To reduce such problems, we will implement a system whereby, an officer of the administrative Ministry would be designated as a monitoring officer to help processing and implementation of the project in 7 conjunction with Central and State authorities for every foreign investment proposal exceeding Rs 100 crore."
10773,1998-99,We are committed to creating a hasslefree procedure and I would like to assure all foreign investors that a decision on their investment proposals shall be taken within a period of 90 days.
10774,1998-99,It will be the personal responsibility of the monitoring officer to ensure this.
10775,1998-99,"The National Agenda, identifies housing as a priority area."
10776,1998-99,"We will move purposefully to tackle the country’s enormous housing shortage problem through partnership between government, housing finance institutions and the private sector."
10777,1998-99,"The budget allocation for the Indira Awas Yojana Programme is being substantially enhanced to Rs 1600 crore, from Rs 1144 crore in RE 1997 98."
10778,1998-99,The scope of this scheme is also being widened to include a loancum subsidy programme.
10779,1998-99,The Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act will be repealed to free the supply of usable urban land for housing construction.
10780,1998-99,The capital base of the Housing and Urban Development Corporation HUDCO is being increased by Rs 110 crore from the budget so that it may leverage more funds for housing construction.
10781,1998-99,I also have some tax incentives for housing which I will outline later in my speech.
10782,1998-99,The acuteness of our infrastructure problems is equalled only by our resolve to tackle them.
10783,1998-99,One of the major planks of this budget is to provide strong stimulus to the infrastructure sector through larger public and private investment in these sectors.
10784,1998-99,This will also help to boost industrial growth and overall economic activity.
10785,1998-99,"The plan outlay for the key infrastructure sectors of Energy, Transport and Communications in the revised estimates for 199798 was Rs 45,252 crore."
10786,1998-99,"I am happy to announce that the outlay for these sectors for the current year will be Rs 61,146 crore."
10787,1998-99,This is an increase of 35 per cent.
10788,1998-99,I am hopeful that this steep increase in investments will trigger industrial activity and revive rapid economic growth.
10789,1998-99,"Within a few weeks of taking office, the government passed an important ordinance for establishing Central and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions with the primary objective of rationalising electricity tariffs."
10790,1998-99,This will go a long way towards enhancing investor confidence in the power sector and facilitate raising resources for higher public and private investment.
10791,1998-99,We have also simplified the procedures for extending sovereign counter guarantees for a few “Fast Track” power projects which were held up for long.
10792,1998-99,We now expect early financial closure of these projects.
10793,1998-99,"The total plan outlay for Ministry of Power is being increased to Rs 9,500 crore as against Rs 6,738 crore in RE 199798."
10794,1998-99,"The outstanding dues from State Electricity Boards to major public sector undertakings such as NTPC and Coal India amount to about Rs 10,000 crore."
10795,1998-99,These large outstanding dues are serious impediments to investment by these public sector undertakings.
10796,1998-99,The government will evolve a guarantee scheme to cover such dues.
10797,1998-99,"On the strength of such guarantees, the PSUs concerned will be able to raise resources either by securitising these debts or directly entering the market for tapping resources."
10798,1998-99,This would help these enterprises to raise resources to fund large projects in the power and coal sectors.
10799,1998-99,The resulting investment will also boost industrial growth and investment through linkage effects.
10800,1998-99,We must build more roads and the quality of our roads must also improve.
10801,1998-99,Our National Highways must be brought up to international standards.
10802,1998-99,I am providing Rs 500 crore for the National Highways Authority of India to catalyse new road projects including fourlaning of existing National Highways.
10803,1998-99,I shall announce some more measures for this sector in Part B of my speech.
10804,1998-99,"To enhance longterm finance for infrastructure investment in the private sector, the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited IDFC was incorporated as a nongovernment company in 1997."
10805,1998-99,"I am happy to inform the House that the IDFC has tied up its paid up equity capital of Rs 1,000 crore, including equity participation of Rs 400 crore by nine foreign investors and has now commenced operation."
10806,1998-99,"In order to put IDFC on par with other all India public Financial Institutions in the matter of fiscal incentives and fund raising benefits extended to these institutions, it is proposed to make necessary amendments to the Companies Act."
10807,1998-99,Provident funds are a potentially important source of funding for private sector infrastructure projects.
10808,1998-99,The present pattern of investment prescribed for provident funds does not permit any investment in securities of private sector infrastructure projects.
10809,1998-99,I propose to provide some flexibility in this regard by allowing upto 10% of the new accretion to provident funds to be invested in private sector securities which have an investment grade rating from at least two credit rating agencies.
10810,1998-99,This is an enabling provision which will allow the Board of Trustees managing these funds to invest in these securities subject to their assessment of the riskreturn prospects of each security.
10811,1998-99,Education is the key vehicle for social transformation.
10812,1998-99,Universalisation of elementary education and eradication of illiteracy are central elements of our social policy.
10813,1998-99,Government also plans to implement the Consitutional provision for making primary education free and compulsory up to fifth standard and for girls up to the college level.
10814,1998-99,"This budget provides for a nearly 50 per cent increase in the total budgetary allocation to Education, from Rs 4,716 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 7,047 crore in this budget."
10815,1998-99,We are committed to raising the total resource allocation for Education to 6 per cent of GDP in a phased manner.
10816,1998-99,The allocations under the Kasturba Gandhi Shiksha Yojana and the Mahila Samiridhi Yojana will be integrated to support a unified Action Plan for accelerating female education.
10817,1998-99,"Swami Vivekanand while exhorting the youth had said “A far greater work is the sacrifice of yourself for the benefit of your race, for the welfare of humanity.”"
10818,1998-99,"In order to harness the limitless energy of the youth, government will formulate a scheme for creation of a National Reconstruction Corps, which will mobilise youth for communitybased nation building activities."
10819,1998-99,The scheme will also promote self employment of youth whereby the volunteers would simultaneously be given training in vocations and entrepreneurship development for taking up selfemployment vocations.
10820,1998-99,An interMinisterial Committee is being set up to work out the details.
10821,1998-99,The Prime Minister has underlined the crucial importance of Information Technology for India.
10822,1998-99,It is the fastest growing sector of the Indian economy as indeed of the world economy.
10823,1998-99,"It has tremendous potential for the generation of employment, incomes and export earnings."
10824,1998-99,It can also provide millions of skilled jobs for women.
10825,1998-99,Our Information Technology specialists and software creators are second to none in the world.
10826,1998-99,The government have set itself a target of making India a Global Information Technology Power and one of the largest generators and exporters of software in the world within ten years.
10827,1998-99,"A National Information Technology Task Force, headed by the Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission has been set up, to formulate a National Informatics Policy which will help achieve our objectives."
10828,1998-99,Our software companies operate in a highly competitive global market and the skilled professionals working in these companies have attractive opportunities abroad.
10829,1998-99,Our companies need flexible systems of incentives to retain their human resources.
10830,1998-99,"They have sought permission to offer stock option schemes to their Indian employees linked to ADR/GDR issues abroad, under which their employees will be eligible for ADR/GDR stock options."
10831,1998-99,"In recognition of the excellent work being done in this sector, and its very special circumstances, the government have decided to formulate a special scheme to allow such options for the software sector."
10832,1998-99,The details of the scheme will be notified separately.
10833,1998-99,I also have some fiscal proposals to support rapid development of this crucial sector which I will present later in my speech.
10834,1998-99,"A mature and well functioning financial system is essential for promoting savings, channelling investment into the most productive activities and ensuring an efficient payments mechanism."
10835,1998-99,The East Asian financial crisis has highlighted the importance of prompt action to strengthen our financial system.
10836,1998-99,The recently submitted Narasimham Committee Report has provided many recommendations which are being examined in consultation with RBI.
10837,1998-99,"However, I am happy to announce that decisions have been taken on some important recommendations."
10838,1998-99,The relatively high level of NonPerforming Assets NPAs in our public sector banks is a cause for concern.
10839,1998-99,"Net NPAs, averaging 9 per cent in 199697, must be brought down to below 5 per cent by the year 2000 2001."
10840,1998-99,"As one way of reducing NPAs, Debt Recovery Tribunals will be strengthened and more Tribunals will be set up to cover all States."
10841,1998-99,A few banks have particularly high NPAs.
10842,1998-99,"These banks will be encouraged, on an experimental basis, to establish Asset Reconstruction Companies, which will takeover the NPAs of the bank at their realisable value and swap them with special bonds to be held by the bank."
10843,1998-99,The Asset Reconstruction companies will concentrate on recovery of dues to realise the maximum value for the assets transferred to them.
10844,1998-99,"To strengthen the underlying health of our banks, RBI is raising the minimum required Capital Adequacy Ratio for banks from the present 8 per cent to 9 per cent by March 31, 2000 and to 10 per cent by as early as possible thereafter."
10845,1998-99,"RBI will also announce certain other enhancements of prudential norms in regard to asset classifications, income recognition, risk weights, etc. *"
10846,1998-99,Our financial system today works under the burden of several archaic laws regarding transfers of and transactions in properties and financial instruments.
10847,1998-99,An Expert Group is being set up to propose precise legal amendments in the key laws to make the provisions consistent with modern financial and banking practices.
10848,1998-99,NonBank Finance Companies NBFCs perform an important role in our financialinvestors.
10849,1998-99,The Reserve Bank of India Act was amended last year with a view to laying down a framework for improved regulation of NBFCs.
10850,1998-99,RBI has recently issued guidelines for registration as also for effective regulation of NBFCs.
10851,1998-99,Our objective will be to develop a framework of prudential regulations and a supervisory system which will foster the development of a healthy financial system and also provide transparent disclosure norms leading to greater depositor awareness to enable the investors to take well informed investment decisions.
10852,1998-99,"Along with reform of the banking sector, it is necessary to move forward with reforms in insurance which has hitherto been a public sector monopoly."
10853,1998-99,"In order to provide better insurance coverage to our citizens and also to augment the flow of longterm resources for financing infrastructure, I propose to open the insurance sector to competition from private Indian companies."
10854,1998-99,The Insurance Regulatory Authority will also be converted into a statutory body.
10855,1998-99,Necessary legislation will be introduced later in the year.
10856,1998-99,FEMA and Money Laundering 42.
10857,1998-99,"The present Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 is outdated and is no longer in keeping with the needs of the economy and the changes that have taken place in foreign exchange markets and transactions."
10858,1998-99,We have moved to full current account convertibility.
10859,1998-99,It is no longer appropriate to deify foreign exchange as something special and maintain a burdensome and highly regulatory structure around this deity.
10860,1998-99,"Accordingly, government have decided to repeal FERA and replace it with a new Foreign Exchange Management Act FEMA, which would be consistent with the needs of a modern economy."
10861,1998-99,The new Bill will be introduced in this session of Parliament.
10862,1998-99,"At the same time, I want to assure the House that the replacement of FERA by FEMA is in no way intended to give license for illegal transactions to drug peddlers, sector."
10863,1998-99,"But regulation of this sector has to improve to protect unwary small 11 terrorists, arm smugglers and other perpetrators of heinous economic crimes."
10864,1998-99,"Indeed, to protect our society from the globally recognised and, growing problem of money laundering, I will also bring an anti Money Laundering Bill before the House simultaneously with FEMA."
10865,1998-99,I am proposing a number of measures to strengthen our capital markets: *
10866,1998-99,The Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI has approved the introduction of trading in stock index futures as a way of providing greater opportunities for hedging and inducing more liquidity into the market.
10867,1998-99,The government will bring forward the necessary amendment to the Securities Contracts Regulation Act to enable derivative instruments to be treated as securities.
10868,1998-99,Foreign institutional investor FII debt funds are today allowed to invest only in listed debt securities.
10869,1998-99,I propose to allow them to invest in unlisted domestic debt securities also; the risk of default would be borne by the FIIs.
10870,1998-99,"To encourage modernisation of broker services, a one time permission was given last year to stock brokers to corporatise their businesses without attracting capital gains tax."
10871,1998-99,I propose to extend this exemption by one year.
10872,1998-99,"To encourage more primary public issues, I am proposing certain changes to expand the income tax deductibility of expenses incurred on public issues."
10873,1998-99,"After some of the turbulent events in the stock markets in recent years, a special effort must be made to restore the confidence of small investors."
10874,1998-99,I am asking SEBI to devote special attention to strengthening the institutional arrangements for protecting small investors from defaults and financial failures of brokers and other market intermediaries.
10875,1998-99,"Whenever I have travelled outside India, NonResident Indians NRIs have expressed a sincere desire to contribute meaningfully to the development of India."
10876,1998-99,"I believe NRIs constitute a huge, untapped potential for India’s development."
10877,1998-99,I propose the following steps to encourage NRIs to participate in the development of their country of origin: *
10878,1998-99,"At present NRIs are allowed to purchase shares in Indian companies in the secondary market subject to a limit of 1 per cent of the company’s total equity for individual NRIs and NRI overseas corporate bodies, with a 5 per cent limit for aggregate NRI/OCB investments in the company."
10879,1998-99,These limits were imposed many years ago when our capital market regulations were much weaker and there were no rules governing acquisition and takeovers.
10880,1998-99,The situation has changed materially in both these respects.
10881,1998-99,"I, therefore, propose to raise the individual investment limit of 1 per cent for NRIs to 5 per cent and the aggregate limit for all NRI investments in a company from 5 per cent to 10 per cent."
10882,1998-99,I am having these procedures thoroughly reviewed with a view to modifying them to facilitate investment by NRIs in our capital markets.
10883,1998-99,The Unit Trust of India will launch a new India Millennium Scheme which will be open for subscription in dollars only by NRIs.
10884,1998-99,The money collected under this scheme would be invested in shares of Indian companies with high potential for growth and in high quality Indian debt.
10885,1998-99,The details of the scheme will be announced shortly.
10886,1998-99,The State Bank of India is launching a new Resurgent India Bond denominated in foreign currencies for subscription by NRIs.
10887,1998-99,"This will enable NRIs to contribute to the flow of resources for our country’s development, especially for building up infrastructure."
10888,1998-99,The bond will be fully repatriable and the government will extend tax concessions similar to those currently available to NRI deposits to this new bond.
10889,1998-99,I am confident that NRIs will welcome this initiative and will contribute liberally to these Bonds.
10890,1998-99,I have one more significant announcement to make for NRI’s.
10891,1998-99,Government have decided to draw up a scheme for issuance of a Persons of Indian Origin PIO Card for those living abroad and having foreign passports.
10892,1998-99,"The PIO Card, which would be extended to persons of Indian Origin settled in countries to be specified by government would besides introducing a visafree regime, also confer some special economic, educational, financial and cultural benefits."
10893,1998-99,The details are being worked out.
10894,1998-99,Decentralisation and Expenditure Restructuring 47.
10895,1998-99,"Government have already appointed a Special Task Force on Devolution of Powers to States, under the Chairmanship of Shri Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, to examine and recommend measures for devolution of additional financial powers to the States and additional or alternative means by which States can raise more resources."
10896,1998-99,The first report of the Task Force has been received.
10897,1998-99,We are examining the recommendations in consultation with the RBI.
10898,1998-99,The distinction between plan and nonplan expenditures in our budgetary system has created several problems.
10899,1998-99,It has led to an excessive focus on so called plan expenditures with a corresponding neglect of items such as maintenance which is classified as nonplan.
10900,1998-99,"Various bodies, including the Finance Commission, have advocated the elimination of the plan and nonplan distinction in the budget."
10901,1998-99,"I propose to constitute a Task Force, including representatives of Planning Commission, Finance Ministry, Comptroller and AuditorGeneral of India and State Governments to examine these issues in a comprehensive manner and to make recommendations for a functionally viable and more focussed presentation of government expenditure in the budget."
10902,1998-99,A related problem is the proliferation of Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes over the years.
10903,1998-99,"There is a need to rationalise these, with the objective of reducing overlaps and duplication, modifying procedures and norms and making them more easily accessible to the intended beneficiary."
10904,1998-99,"The Task Force, mentioned above, will also advise on this issue."
10905,1998-99,Development of North Eastern Region 5 0 .
10906,1998-99,The government have already decided to restructure the North Eastern Council NEC for speedy implementation of important infrastructural programmes 13 in this region.
10907,1998-99,Sikkim will also be included in the Council.
10908,1998-99,Necessary legislation will be introduced in Parliament to effect these changes.
10909,1998-99,"Furthermore, it has been decided that a nonlapsable Central Resource Pool will be created for deposit of funds from all Ministries where the plan expenditure on the North Eastern region is less than 10 per cent of the total plan allocation of the Ministry."
10910,1998-99,"The difference between 10 per cent of the allocation and the actual expenditure incurred on the North Eastern region will be transferred to the Central Pool, which will be used for funding specific programmes for economic and social upliftment of the North Eastern States."
10911,1998-99,The NorthEastern Development Finance Corporation Limited NEDFi promoted by public sector financial institutions and banks was incorporated in 1995.
10912,1998-99,NEDFi strives to respond to the specific needs of industries in the NorthEast.
10913,1998-99,At present there is one State Financial Corporation SFC in Assam and twin function Industrial Development Corporations IDCs in some other States.
10914,1998-99,"In order to foster healthy and efficient growth of these institutions, I am proposing that the refinancing function for industrial loans of SFC/IDCs of the NorthEast will be undertaken henceforth by NEDFi, rather than IDBI/SIDBI as at present."
10915,1998-99,Disinvestment/Privatisation/PSU Reform 53.
10916,1998-99,"The regular budget takes credit for a receipt of Rs 5,000 crore from disinvestment in the current year."
10917,1998-99,"In order to expedite the process the government have decided to disinvest specified portions of equity from IOC, GAIL, VSNL and CONCOR."
10918,1998-99,"As part of an overall strategy to restructure Indian Airlines and expand its capacity, government have decided to restructure the capital of Indian Airlines and also to undertake a phased disinvestment in this company, over three years, bringing the government’s equity holding down to 49 per cent."
10919,1998-99,Some public sector undertakings have consistently incurred large losses.
10920,1998-99,"Experience and studies by independent organisations, have conclusively established them to be unrevivable."
10921,1998-99,"Nevertheless, a decision on their closure has been delayed only on account of the concern for the interest of the workers."
10922,1998-99,"In order to find a viable and satisfactory solution to this dilemma, the government have decided to provide a safety net to the workers of enterprises destined for closure by providing a liberal and attractive compensation package prior to closure."
10923,1998-99,"At present, when a unit is closed, the workers are only entitled to retrenchment compensation under the Industries Development and Regulation Act, which is only 15 days wages for each completed year of service."
10924,1998-99,"To make the compensation package attractive, it is proposed to make applicable the benefits of VRS package, namely 45 days wages for each completed year of service, subject to the maximum wage or salary accruable on the basis of the balance of years of service left to all the workers of these public sector units."
10925,1998-99,"As a further improvement to the package, the workers of these units will also be eligible for a maximum of 60 months or 5 years salary or wages as compensation in the case of all those who have completed not less than 30 years of service."
10926,1998-99,This would mean that all those who have put in more than 30 years of service will get more than the normal VRS.
10927,1998-99,The other conditions of the VRS will apply and this offer will be made time bound.
10928,1998-99,A separate Restructuring Fund is being constituted for this purpose and these public sector enterprises will be advanced funds from the budget to offer a 14 compensation package to the workers.
10929,1998-99,"Once the labour is separated, the assets of the company will be available for disposal at the best economic price."
10930,1998-99,"The proceeds of the disposal, after settling all pending liabilities, will be credited to the Restructuring Fund which will get recouped to that extent."
10931,1998-99,"This would enable the fund to operate on atleast a partially selfsustaining basis and it is expected that, in the course of time, budgetary support for the fund will gradually diminish."
10932,1998-99,"Government have also decided that in the generality of cases, the government shareholding in public sector enterprises will be brought down to 26 per cent."
10933,1998-99,"In cases of public sector enterprises involving strategic considerations, government will continue to retain majority holding."
10934,1998-99,The interest of workers shall be protected in all cases.
10935,1998-99,Budget Estimates for 199899 57.
10936,1998-99,As Hon’ble Members are aware details of the revised estimates for 199798 were presented along with the interim budget in March 1998.

10938,1998-99,The figures that are given below are the budget estimates for 199899.

10974,1998-99,"The provision for interest payments has increased from Rs 65,700 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 75,000 crore."
10975,1998-99,"The provision for Defence expenditure has been increased substantially from Rs 36,099 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 41,200 crore."
10976,1998-99,"I will consider further increase in the budgetary support during the course of the year, if necessary."
10977,1998-99,There can be no compromise in our defence preparedness.
10978,1998-99,"An amount of Rs 9,000 crore is being earmarked for Food subsidy in 1998 99 representing an increase of Rs 1,500 crore over RE 199798."
10979,1998-99,The provision for sugar subsidy has been retained at Rs 400 crore.
10980,1998-99,An increase in food subsidy has become necessary due to recent revision of minimum support price for wheat procurement and also to clear arrears pertaining to previous years.
10981,1998-99,"Pursuant to the change in the selling price of urea, the provision for subsidy on indigenous nitrogenous fertilisers is being reduced from Rs 6,600 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 6,000 crore."
10982,1998-99,"The subsidy on decontrolled phosphatic and potassic fertilisers is being increased from Rs 2,600 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 3,000 crore."
10983,1998-99,"Grants to States is being enhanced in 199899 from Rs 4,114 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 6,314 crore representing an increase of Rs 2,200 crore."
10984,1998-99,"Of this, the increase of Rs 950 crore is due to assistance to the States for improvement in the pay & allowances of the university and college teachers."
10985,1998-99,The balance of the increase is mainly due to grants under Tenth Finance Commission’s award.
10986,1998-99,"The provision for pension is being increased by Rs 459 crore over RE 1997 98 to Rs 7,342 crore."
10987,1998-99,This provision takes into account the effect of Government’s decision to raise the age of superannuation from 58 years to 60 years.
10988,1998-99,This will also have have an impact on the Small Savings Collections.
10989,1998-99,"The provision for loans to States and Union Territories against net small savings collections is being kept at Rs 14,200 crore against the provision of Rs 15,732 crore in RE 199798."
10990,1998-99,"A provision of Rs 1,482 crore has been made for nonplan loans to public sector enterprises mainly for payment of salaries and wages to the employees of sick and convalescent PSUs."
10991,1998-99,Revenue Receipts I shall now turn to the revenue receipts.
10992,1998-99,"Hon’ble Members are aware that on the basis of a consensus reached in the Third Meeting of the InterState Council held on July 17, 1997, the then government had approved in principle to accept the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission regarding the alternative scheme of sharing of Centre’s tax revenues with the States."
10993,1998-99,I am happy to announce that we have ratified this decision.
10994,1998-99,"Accordingly, I propose to shortly introduce a Constitution Amendment Bill to give effect to this alternative scheme subject only to one modification."
10995,1998-99,The modification is that the percentage share of States’ share in the gross proceeds of Central taxes may be reviewed by successive Finance Commissions instead of freezing it for fifteen years as suggested by the Tenth Finance Commission.
10996,1998-99,"Gross tax revenues at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 1,48,506 crore."
10997,1998-99,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, we had made a provision of Rs 7,594 crore in the RE 199798 for States’ share in the proceeds of the Voluntary Disclosure of Income Scheme, 1997 as the collections were estimated to be 17 Rs 10,050 crore by March 31, 1998."
10998,1998-99,"However, the actual collection is reported to be about Rs 1,000 crore less."
10999,1998-99,"After making adjustment for the excess share paid to the States, I am providing Rs 39,074 crore as the share of taxes of the States."
11000,1998-99,"Thus, the Centre’s net tax revenue will be Rs 1,09,432 crore over RE 199798 of Rs 99,158 crore."
11001,1998-99,"Nontax revenues are estimated to increase from Rs 39,356 crore in RE 1997 98 to Rs 45,137 crore this year."
11002,1998-99,"I have taken credit for Rs 2,800 crore as license fee from the operators of cellular and basic telecom services and Rs 4,200 crore as net surplus profits of the Reserve Bank of India."
11003,1998-99,"The net revenue receipts for the Centre, including nontax receipts, are expected to increase from Rs 1,38,514 crore in RE 199798 to Rs 1,54,569 crore in 199899."
11004,1998-99,"In the area of capital receipts, market borrowings are placed at Rs 55,931 crore."
11005,1998-99,"Net external assistance is estimated at Rs 2,337 crore."
11006,1998-99,"I am also taking credit for receipts from disinvestment of equity in public sector enterprises of Rs 5,000 crore."
11007,1998-99,I shall come to the fiscal deficit in Part B of my speech.
11008,1998-99,"PART B Sir, I now present my tax proposals."
11009,1998-99,There has been much talk of a tough budget.
11010,1998-99,The temptation to raise taxes in the given situation was indeed great.
11011,1998-99,But I recognise that direct tax policy must impart stability and confidence both to individuals and corporates.
11012,1998-99,"Therefore, any uncertainty in this regard must be ended."
11013,1998-99,Tax rates introduced last year are moderate enough.
11014,1998-99,I do not propose to introduce any changes in the rate structure either for individual or corporate taxes.
11015,1998-99,"I do hope that longterm stability in tax structure would create virtuous circles of increased productivity, voluntary compliance and enhance our tax widening efforts."
11016,1998-99,"In fact, I am going to announce a couple of concessions."
11017,1998-99,"Considering the difficulties experienced by the tax payers at the marginal level, the level for tax exemption is being raised from the existing limit of Rs 40,000 to Rs 50,000."
11018,1998-99,"Salary earners having income upto Rs 1 lakh will be further pleased to know that I propose to raise the ceiling of standard deduction in their case from Rs 20,000 to Rs 25,000."
11019,1998-99,"Their pleasure, I hope, will be happily shared by those salary earners whose income is more than Rs 5 lakhs."
11020,1998-99,They will henceforth not be entitled to this deduction.
11021,1998-99,"For salary earners having income between Rs 1 lakh and Rs 5 lakhs, no change is proposed in the existing position."
11022,1998-99,"I also propose to enhance the ceiling of taxfree reimbursement of medical expenses from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000."
11023,1998-99,"In a country of our size, it is a matter of great anxiety that the total number of assessees constitutes less than 1.25% of our population."
11024,1998-99,The scope for tax widening remains the single most formidable challenge in the area of direct taxes.
11025,1998-99,It is well accepted tenet of taxation policy that moderate rates of taxes only make sense if the 18 net is wide and the scope of evasion progressively minimised.
11026,1998-99,"Towards this objective, I propose to take some important initiatives."
11027,1998-99,"Last year, a scheme was introduced to cover 12 important cities where if you fulfil two of the four criteria, namely, possession of a house, subscription to a telephone, spending on foreign travel and possession of a motor vehicle, you would be obliged to file an incometax return."
11028,1998-99,This scheme had several lacunae which I propose to remove.
11029,1998-99,"In the first instance, the scheme is being extended now to cover 23 more cities in India taking the total coverage to 35 cities."
11030,1998-99,"The net itself is being enlarged to include two additional criteria, namely, holding a credit card and membership of expensive clubs, taking the total parameters to six."
11031,1998-99,"Finally, the matching of two out of four parameters apart from being an administratively onerous task provided an escape route to many potential assessees."
11032,1998-99,"I believe that if any one fulfils one of the six criteria, it would be reasonable to ask the individual to file his incometax return."
11033,1998-99,It could thereafter be determined whether he is liable for payment of taxes or not.
11034,1998-99,"This revised “OnebySix”, as the scheme would now be known, is a significant initiative in our tax widening efforts and it is my intention to raise the total number of individuals filing their incometax returns by at least 50 percent during a full fiscal year."
11035,1998-99,"Coupled with tax widening, tax evasion continues to be a serious handicap."
11036,1998-99,"While efforts at enforcement would be strengthened, I propose to undertake a new initiative in making it obligatory for assessees to quote their PAN or GIR number mandatorily in respect of certain high value transactions."
11037,1998-99,These transactions would be : *
11038,1998-99,Purchase & Sale of immovable property *
11039,1998-99,Purchase & Sale of motor vehicles *
11040,1998-99,"Transaction in shares exceeding Rs 50,000 * Opening of new bank accounts *"
11041,1998-99,"Fixed deposits of more than Rs 50,000 * Applications for allotment of telephone connection *"
11042,1998-99,"Payment to hotels exceeding Rs 25,000/. With increased usage of computerisation, this data will be fully utilised for increasing the taxbase and for preventing the leakage of revenue."
11043,1998-99,We must recognise that the cumbersome nature of our income tax forms coupled with complex procedures is a serious deterrent to an honest individual in becoming an assessee.
11044,1998-99,"I, therefore, propose to introduce, for the first time, a simple one page taxpayerfriendly return form to be hereinafter called, ‘SARAL’, applicable to all noncorporate taxpayers."
11045,1998-99,SARAL can be filled up easily without the aid of Chartered Accountants or Tax Advisors.
11046,1998-99,"The ‘SARAL’, I hope, would become popular enough, through voluntary compliance and the assistance of NGOs, which I propose to muster, along with mobile vans for important cities, can be widely distributed and collected easily on spot."
11047,1998-99,"This will, apart from contributing to our tax widening effort, also make an important psychological difference in the mindset of potential tax assessees."
11048,1998-99,Litigation has been the bane of both direct and indirect taxes.
11049,1998-99,A lot of energy of the Revenue Department is being frittered in pursuing large number of litigations pending at different levels for long periods of time.
11050,1998-99,Considerable revenue 19 also gets locked up in such disputes.
11051,1998-99,"Declogging the system will not only incentivise honest taxpayers, enable government to realise its reasonable dues much earlier but coupled with administrative measures, would also make the system more user friendly."
11052,1998-99,"I, therefore, propose to introduce a new scheme called “SAMADHAN”."
11053,1998-99,"The scheme would apply to both direct taxes and indirect taxes and offer waiver of interest, penalty and immunity from prosecution on payment of arrears of direct tax at the current rates."
11054,1998-99,"In respect of indirect tax, where in recent years the adjustment of rates has been very sharp, an abatement of 50 per cent of the duty would be available alongwith waiver of interest, penalty and immunity from prosecution."
11055,1998-99,Legal measures are also being proposed to limit and expedite litigation.
11056,1998-99,"These include enhanced scale of fees for filing appeals before the Appellate Commissioner and the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, abolition of the level of Deputy Commissioner Appeals, provision of direct appeals to High Courts to reduce delay, and also extension of the scope of the Authority for Advance Ruling to notified categories of resident tax payers."
11057,1998-99,Moderate rates and large concessions do not go hand in hand.
11058,1998-99,"I have, therefore, carried out a review of the various concessions and exemptions under the Incometax Act."
11059,1998-99,I find that many of them are no longer necessary and some of them are also being used for tax avoidance.
11060,1998-99,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw many of these provisions."
11061,1998-99,These include exemption to the Export Import Bank of India and exemption in respect of certain perquisites of foreigners employed in India.
11062,1998-99,"The blanket exemption in respect of educational and medical institutions which is being misused, is proposed to be withdrawn, compelling such institutions to come under a discipline."
11063,1998-99,"However, safeguards are being provided to ensure that the institutions genuinely serving the social cause in either field do not lose the existing benefits."
11064,1998-99,I also propose to plug certain loopholes.
11065,1998-99,Rule 5a of the First Schedule to the Incometax Act relating to computation of profit of insurance business other than life insurance business is being amended to prevent leakage of revenue.
11066,1998-99,"Similarly, section 1023G of that Act is being recast to serve the objective of infrastructure financing without misuse of the concession."
11067,1998-99,"Under the existing provisions, there is no mechanism to ensure that the tax free funds raised by an infrastructure enterprise are actually used for infrastructure development within a reasonable time and are not used for any other purpose."
11068,1998-99,I propose to provide such a mechanism.
11069,1998-99,Gifttax has been levied in India since 1958.
11070,1998-99,The revenue yield from this tax has been insignificant.
11071,1998-99,Last year we collected barely Rs 9 crore.
11072,1998-99,The Gifttax Act has also not been successful as an instrument to curb tax evasion and avoidance.
11073,1998-99,"I, therefore, propose to discontinue the levy of gift tax on gifts made after 30th September, 1998."
11074,1998-99,"At the same time, to ensure that there are no leakages of income tax revenue through the mechanism of gifts, I propose to tax the gifts under the Incometax Act itself in the hands of the recipients."
11075,1998-99,"However, the gifts from non residents including NRIs through banking channels will continue to enjoy exemption as at present."
11076,1998-99,I have already said that housing is an area which requires our utmost attention.
11077,1998-99,"Therefore, I propose several incentives to encourage housebuilding activity."
11078,1998-99,These include : * Tax holiday for approved housing projects  100 per cent deduction from profits for first five years and 30 per cent deduction for subsequent five years.
11079,1998-99,"Increased deductions against income from house property  deduction for repairs and collection charges increased from 1/5th to 1/4th and deduction for interest on borrowed capital in case of selfoccupied property increased from Rs 15,000 to Rs 30,000."
11080,1998-99,Carryforward of losses from house property against future income under the same head to be allowed for 8 years.
11081,1998-99,Deduction equal to 50 per cent of the profits to companies engaged in housing projects aided by the World Bank.
11082,1998-99,Section 80GG in respect of deduction for rents paid is being reintroduced.
11083,1998-99,Exemptions to certain specified properties like commercial complexes under the Wealthtax Act.
11084,1998-99,"Other areas in the social sector for which new tax incentives are proposed or the existing ones being increased include employment generation, improvement of environment, upliftment of women, road safety, cooperatives and medical expenses of the handicapped."
11085,1998-99,I propose to allow a new deduction to companies with a view to encourage them to employ additional work force.
11086,1998-99,"An amount equal to 30 per cent of additional wages paid to the new workmen will be allowed as a deduction against profits, subject to certain conditions."
11087,1998-99,"For improvement of environment, I propose to allow 100 percent deduction, subject to a ceiling of Rs 5 lakhs, to undertakings engaged in the collection or processing of biodegradable waste."
11088,1998-99,I also propose to make activities which encourage the production of bacteria induced fertilisers eligible for 100 per cent deduction under section 35AC of the Incometax Act.
11089,1998-99,Necessary amendment in the rules will be notified for this purpose.
11090,1998-99,"Similar benefit is proposed to be extended to the activities of establishing and running of educational institutions, hospitals and medical facilities in rural areas exclusively for women and children and also creches and schools for the children of workers employed in factories or at project sites."
11091,1998-99,I also propose similar amendment of rules to make activities which promote road safety and traffic awareness and prevent accidents eligible for 100 per cent deduction under section 35AC. 1 0 4 .
11092,1998-99,The promotion of sports and games in the country needs to be encouraged.
11093,1998-99,I propose setting up of National Sports Fund and further propose that donations made to the Fund will be eligible for 100 per cent deduction.
11094,1998-99,I propose to extend 100% tax holiday granted to industrial undertakings located in any industrially backward State or district till the year 2000.
11095,1998-99,"I also propose similar extension of tax holiday to power sector upto the year 2003 and also to new refineries set up after 1st October, 1998."
11096,1998-99,I also propose to extend infrastructure status to inland waterways and inland ports.
11097,1998-99,I further propose tax holiday benefits to radio paging services and services provided by satellite owners for telecommunication.
11098,1998-99,I also propose several measures in response to demands from business and industry.
11099,1998-99,Certain categories of business reorganisations are proposed to be freed from any additional tax liability or loss of tax benefits keeping in view the necessity of such reorganisation consequent on economic liberalisation.
11100,1998-99,No capital gain would be charged and the benefit of carryforward of losses and unabsorbed depreciation would be allowed in case of specified reorganisations.
11101,1998-99,Intangible assets are proposed to be allowed depreciation at the rate of 25 per cent.
11102,1998-99,Provisions for amortisation of preliminary expenses are proposed to be liberalised.
11103,1998-99,The period of amortisation is proposed to be reduced from 10 years to 5 years and the rate of deduction will consequently be doubled.
11104,1998-99,Stock lending is proposed to be exempted from capital gains.
11105,1998-99,Delay in refund of excess tax collected tantamounts to denial of justice.
11106,1998-99,"It is a source of constant harassment, particularly of small tax payers."
11107,1998-99,"I intend to mitigate this difficulty by effecting an amendment in section 192 of the Incometax Act which will enable adjustment of loss from house property against salary income, at the source itself."
11108,1998-99,"This, I believe, will eliminate a large number of refund claims."
11109,1998-99,"In response to demands from tax payers, I propose to take further measures."
11110,1998-99,"Under the existing provisions of section 44AA of the Incometax Act, every person carrying on business or profession is required to maintain account books, if his income from business exceeds Rs 40,000 or his total turnover exceeds Rs 5 lakhs."
11111,1998-99,"Considering the increased cost of engaging accountants, I propose to enhance these limits to Rs 1,20,000 and Rs 10 lakhs respectively."
11112,1998-99,"I further propose that the penalty leviable at the minimum rate of Rs 100 per day for failure to furnish certificates of tax deduction or collection at source under section 203 or to deliver copies of declarations under section 197A, shall not exceed the amount of tax deductible or collectible, as the case may be."
11113,1998-99,"Presently, there is no such ceiling on the quantum of penalty leviable which causes hardship, particularly to small businessmen."
11114,1998-99,Certain demands of the film industry have also engaged my attention and I propose to give relief to them.
11115,1998-99,"Under the existing rules, if a film is released on commercial basis at least 180 days before the end of the previous year, full amortisation of the cost incurred on production or acquisition of distribution rights of the film is allowed in the year of release itself whereas if the film is released later, full amortisation is not allowed in that year."
11116,1998-99,"Considering that nowadays film producers and distributors release a large number of prints simultaneously to counter the threat of videopirates and cable television, resulting in shorter life span for exploitation of films, I propose to reduce the aforesaid period of 180 days to 90 days."
11117,1998-99,This will enable the film industry to quickly recoup the cost of film production and distribution.
11118,1998-99,"I also propose that producers of films, who are required to furnish information in respect of all payments over Rs 5,000 to the Incometax Department in any financial year would have to do so now only in respect of payments over Rs 25,000."
11119,1998-99,I hope these measures would inspire the film industry to make better and healthier films.
11120,1998-99,A controversy has arisen recently regarding the deductibility of payments by way of extortion money.
11121,1998-99,"To set the controversy at rest, I propose to explicitly 22 provide retrospectively since the inception of Incometax Act, 1961 that any money paid by way of extortion will not qualify for deduction as a business expense."
11122,1998-99,"As further rationalisation measure, I propose to make certain amendments with regard to block assessment procedure and treatment of MODVAT credit in the valuation of inventories and capital assets."
11123,1998-99,The limit of room rent in hotels for the purpose of attracting expenditure tax is proposed to be increased from Rs 1200 to Rs 2000 per day.
11124,1998-99,Taxpayers all over the world have a sense of pride in discharging their legitimate dues to the government and the society recognises the important contribution they are making in enabling the State to discharge its responsibilities.
11125,1998-99,"In this country, regrettably, the culture of pride by honest taxpayer and a social recognition of his important role has yet to evolve."
11126,1998-99,We must make a change in this mindset.
11127,1998-99,"Towards this objective, I propose to introduce a scheme called “SAMMAN” to demonstrate the society’s recognition of their important contribution to the national cause."
11128,1998-99,The details of the facilities and recognition to be conferred on the taxpayers and PAN holders would be separately announced.
11129,1998-99,"I hope the above measures alongwith SARAL, SAMMAN and SAMADHAN will go a long way in making our efforts to increase the tax payers compliance a success."
11130,1998-99,"But while we are doing what we can, I call upon the people of India to do their patriotic duty by the country and honestly pay their taxes."
11131,1998-99,"Before I move on to indirect tax, I would like to state that a large number of suggestions were received from all sections of tax payers and I have got them carefully examined."
11132,1998-99,It is not practicable to acknowledge all these communications individually.
11133,1998-99,I do so now collectively and am extremely thankful to the tax payers for their valuable suggestions.
11134,1998-99,"Hon’ble Members would see from the budget documents that the figure projected by way of revenue realisation from direct taxes is Rs 48,855 crore which is higher than the figure indicated in the interim budget."
11135,1998-99,"This is after taking into account the revenue loss of Rs 950 crore, worked out on a mechanical basis, arising out of certain proposals for reliefs and concessions placed before the House."
11136,1998-99,"We intend to make this loss up and collect the budgeted amount through improved collection of arrears, continuation of the tax base enlargement efforts, rigorous enforcement and tightening measures reflected in the budget proposals."
11137,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, our mediumterm objective is to enhance the taxGDP ratio."
11138,1998-99,"As far as customs duties are concerned the process of restructuring has resulted in a progressive reduction in tariffs, with a view to align these with internationally acceptable levels, and the broadbanding of rates."
11139,1998-99,These measures have enhanced the competitveness of Indian industry.
11140,1998-99,"On the excise side, until a few years ago the regime was characterised by a multiplicity of rates and punctuated with numerous ad hoc exemptions."
11141,1998-99,"As a result, the tax structure was opaque."
11142,1998-99,It is the objective of the present proposals to introduce greater transparency in the system through a significant rationalisation of rates.
11143,1998-99,The ultimate objective of this process is to move towards a Central Value Added Tax VAT system which can then be merged with a generalised VAT.
11144,1998-99,It is our intention to move in this broad direction.
11145,1998-99,The domestic industry has responded favourably to the restructuring of customs duties and has shown commendable resilience.
11146,1998-99,They need to improve their competitive efficiency to meet the challenges of global competition.
11147,1998-99,But they also have legitimate concerns which cannot be ignored.
11148,1998-99,"In this background, the path of transition has to be carefully calibrated to ensure that the adjustment process for the Indian industry is orderly without leading to serious disruption."
11149,1998-99,I have received representations from a cross section of the industry about the regime of import duties.
11150,1998-99,Members have also written to me expressing their concern on the general health of the domestic industry.
11151,1998-99,The demands are diverse and asymmetrical in most cases.
11152,1998-99,This is for obvious reasons.
11153,1998-99,"While the users of imported raw materials and other inputs or the consumers of finished imported goods would benefit from further reduction in import duties, the domestic producers have made a convincing case for urgent relief to the domestic industry."
11154,1998-99,I have given my earnest consideration to these concerns and the competing claims.
11155,1998-99,I am persuaded about a clear disability that our commodity taxation inflicts on the indigenous goods visavis the imported goods.
11156,1998-99,"While the former are subjected to sales tax and other local taxes and levies, the import sector escapes them by their very nature."
11157,1998-99,"In order to provide a level playingfield to the domestic industry, I propose to impose an additional nonmodvatable levy of 8% on imports which is approximately equal to the burden of local taxes on domestic producers."
11158,1998-99,This duty should not be viewed as a protectionist measure but only as a response to a legitimate demand for a level playing field.
11159,1998-99,"The new levy would not apply to crude oil, newsprint, capital goods sector under a special tariff regime or goods which are subjected to additional duties of excise in lieu of sales tax, gold and silver imported by passengers or other nominated agencies and life saving drugs that are free from customs duties."
11160,1998-99,The levy would also not apply to goods which are currently exempt both from basic and additional duties of customs.
11161,1998-99,"Similarly, goods imported for subsequent trading have also been left out of its purview, since they bear the burden of Sales tax at the time of first sale."
11162,1998-99,The new levy will also not apply to inputs imported under exportpromotion schemes.
11163,1998-99,"In addition, there may be other sectors eligible for exemptions."
11164,1998-99,These would be examined and if considered appropriate notified separately.
11165,1998-99,The gradual reduction of import duties in the past few years has resulted in certain distortions and anomalies.
11166,1998-99,My proposals seek to correct them as far as found feasible without causing abrupt disruption in the duty structure.
11167,1998-99,The steel industry has shown considerable resilience in the past to withstand gradual reduction in customs duties.
11168,1998-99,"Last year, however, the steel industry has not shown any appreciable growth."
11169,1998-99,I propose to increase the customs duty on cold rolled coils of iron and steel from 25% to 30%.
11170,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on stainless steel melting scrap from 10% to 5% and on refractory ceramic goods from 40% to 30%.
11171,1998-99,I am confident that these changes alongwith the imposition of the special additional duty that I have proposed on the imports in general would provide adequate relief to the steel industry.
11172,1998-99,The duty on wrought copper is being raised from 30% to 35%.
11173,1998-99,I do not intend to make any other changes in the duty structure applicable to ferrous and nonferrous metals.
11174,1998-99,"Textile intermediates like DMT, PTA, MEG attract customs duty at 25%."
11175,1998-99,"However, caprolactum which is the raw material for making nylon yarn is subjected to a higher duty of 30% ."
11176,1998-99,I am reducing the duty on caprolactum also to the level of 25% so that all the major textile intermediates attract the same rate of duty.
11177,1998-99,"The import duty on paraxylene, an important input for synthetic fibres and yarn, is being reduced from a total of 15% to 5%."
11178,1998-99,The decentralised sector of the textile industry generates avenues for employment.
11179,1998-99,It deserves to be encouraged by reducing cost.
11180,1998-99,I propose to reduce customs duty on apparel grade raw wool from a total of 25% to 20%.
11181,1998-99,The duty on wool waste and garnetted stock of wool is also being reduced by the same extent.
11182,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on acetate and cuprammoniun filament yarn from 30% to 20%.
11183,1998-99,"In the same vein, machinery required for viscose filament yarn and woollen industry is being accorded the concessional duty of 10% 1 2 8 ."
11184,1998-99,The import of paper and paper board has shown phenomenal growth in terms of quantity.
11185,1998-99,"In order to improve the competitiveness of the domestic producers, I propose to increase the customs duty on paper and paper board from 20% to 30%."
11186,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, my government values the right to information."
11187,1998-99,"With a view to further strengthen this right, I propose to reduce customs duty on standard newsprint from 10% to 5%."
11188,1998-99,I also propose to rationalise the duty structure by subjecting glazed newsprint to the same rate of duty.
11189,1998-99,"Furthermore, I also intend to exempt newsprint from the applicability of 8% across the board special additional duty."
11190,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on light weight coated paper weighing upto 51 grams per square metre for printing of magazines to a total of 5%.
11191,1998-99,The customs duty on photographic chemicals is being raised from 25% to 30%.
11192,1998-99,"Similarly, the duty on citric acid is being increased from 30% to 40%."
11193,1998-99,I propose to reduce the customs duty on jumbo rolls of cinematographic film from 25% to10%.
11194,1998-99,Motor vehicle parts are generally subjected to customs duty at 40%.
11195,1998-99,"However, I.C. engines and parts thereof for motor vehicles attract a lower rate of 20%."
11196,1998-99,I propose to raise the customs duty thereon to 30%.
11197,1998-99,I propose to reduce the duty on industrial diamonds from 30% to 20%.
11198,1998-99,This would help the diamond cutting tool industry.
11199,1998-99,"As a measure of rationalisation, I propose to reduce the duty on rayon grade wood pulp from 10% to 5%."
11200,1998-99,Thalassaemia is a lifethreatening blooddisorder.
11201,1998-99,"There have been requests for exempting maltol, an input used in the manufacture of drugs for the treatment of this disorder."
11202,1998-99,I propose to fully exempt maltol from customs duty.
11203,1998-99,Hydroxy ethyl starch and dextran are used in the manufacture of artificial plasma which is free from import duty.
11204,1998-99,I propose to reduce the burden of duty on artificial plasma by reducing the duty on hydroxy ethyl strach and dextran from 30% to 5%.
11205,1998-99,"I also propose to exempt Lamivudine, which is used for the treatment of AIDS, from customs duty."
11206,1998-99,Leather industry contributes significantly to our export effort.
11207,1998-99,"In order to encourage its export, I propose to reduce the duty on specified machinery for leather industry from 20% to 5%."
11208,1998-99,This would also be the rate applicable to leather splitting machinery.
11209,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on saddle trees from 30% to 10%.
11210,1998-99,"Sir, the House is aware that India has joined the Information Technology Agreement."
11211,1998-99,We are committed to abolish the import duty on products of information technology.
11212,1998-99,This is not because we are bound by the ITA but because we are convinced that spread of information technology and freer exchange of information is the key to success and human welfare.
11213,1998-99,"I propose to reduce the duty on floppy disk drives, hard disk drives and CDROM drives from a total of 12% to 5%."
11214,1998-99,The duty on ICs of value exceeding one thousand rupees per piece is also being reduced to 5%.
11215,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on computer parts excluding PPCB from a total of 15% to 12%.
11216,1998-99,The duty on PPCB is being reduced from a total of 25% to 22%.
11217,1998-99,I also propose to reduce the duty on cathode ray tubes for colour monitors for computers from a total of 15% to 5% and on deflection components for colour monitors for computers from a total of 25% to 5%.
11218,1998-99,My proposals also include reduction in duty on telecom software from 40% to 30%.
11219,1998-99,Such software henceforth will not be subject to any additional duty of customs.
11220,1998-99,"In order to encourage the domestic telecom equipment sector, I propose to reduce the duty on parts of such equipment to 20%."
11221,1998-99,"As a measure of environmental protection, I propose to reduce the import duty on sawn wood and certain other varieties of wood from 30% to 25%."
11222,1998-99,"I also propose to reduce the duty on biopesticides, which are ecofriendly , from 30% to 5%."

11225,1998-99,"On silicon, which is widely used in solar energy applications, I propose to reduce the duty to half of the existing 10%."
11226,1998-99,I propose to reduce the duty on  * Solar cells and modules from 30% to 20% *
11227,1998-99,Button cells from 20% to 10% *
11228,1998-99,Watch movements from 25% to 20% *
11229,1998-99,DC micro motors from 40% to 20% * CD mechanism from 40% to 30% 142.
11230,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker Sir, good roads are a necessity for social and economic development."
11231,1998-99,I am sure that those of us who are privileged to afford personalised vehicles can afford to contribute to the faster development of good roads in the country.
11232,1998-99,I propose to charge an additional tax at the rate of rupee one per litre on petrol with immediate effect.
11233,1998-99,This is expected to generate an amount of Rs 790 crore in a year which will be used for the development of roads and entirely go towards augmenting the corpus of the National Highways Authority of India.
11234,1998-99,I propose to extend the concessions presently available to import of equipment for construction of National Highways to other roadconstruction projects also.
11235,1998-99,The importers of precious yellow metal can certainly afford to contribute a bit more to the national exchequer.
11236,1998-99,I propose to increase the import duty on gold from 220 rupees per ten grams to 250 rupees per ten grams.
11237,1998-99,The duty free allowance for baggage is Rs 6000 at present.
11238,1998-99,Many countries do not impose any such restrictions.
11239,1998-99,While we may not follow them there is need to increase the present limit to reduce delays in clearance of passengers.
11240,1998-99,I propose to increase the baggage allowance from Rs 6000 to Rs 12000 for passengers returning to India after a stay exceeding three days.
11241,1998-99,"I also propose to extend free allowance of Rs 3000 to Indian residents returning from Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar or China by air, after a stay exceeding three days."
11242,1998-99,There are a number of items on which it is necessary to reduce the customs duties marginally on account of GATT binding.
11243,1998-99,I do not wish to take the time of the House in going into the details.
11244,1998-99,The government is committed to provide a tax code which is consistent with dismantling of administered pricing mechanism of petroleum products in a phased manner.
11245,1998-99,"By the year 2001, the import duty on crude has to be reduced from the current level of 27% to not more than 5%."
11246,1998-99,"The import duty on down stream products like furnace oil, LSHS, HSD oil, motor spirit and ATF has also to be reduced to the level of 10% to 15%."
11247,1998-99,"In this process, we will ensure an effective protection not exceeding 20% for downstream industry by suitable differential and calibration of import duty structure."
11248,1998-99,I have initiated the process of implementing the decisions arising from the dismantling of administered pricing mechanism.
11249,1998-99,I propose to reduce the customs duty on crude from a total of 27% to 22%.
11250,1998-99,This is estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 965 crore in a year.
11251,1998-99,"In order to recoup the loss, I propose to increase the excise duty on motor spirit from 20% to 35%."
11252,1998-99,"I also propose to impose customs duty on kerosene imported for parallel marketing at 32%, including special duty of 2%."
11253,1998-99,I now come to my proposals on central excise.
11254,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the contribution of the small scale sector in the economy cannot be over emphasised."
11255,1998-99,It is a critical fast track for generating employment thus promising support to thousands of families.
11256,1998-99,The predecessor governments have been sympathetic to the small scale sector but I am afraid they have not done enough to encourage them so as to exploit their full potential.
11257,1998-99,The fiscal incentives provided to the small scale sector have been rather meagre for a number of years.
11258,1998-99,I have taken certain important steps in this direction.
11259,1998-99,"I propose to raise the exemption limit for excise purpose from Rs 30 lakhs to Rs 50 lakhs, an increase of about 65%."
11260,1998-99,The clearances between Rs 50 lakhs to Rs 100 lakhs shall be charged to a flat nominal rate of 5%.
11261,1998-99,These proposals would result in a revenue loss of Rs 300 crore in a year.
11262,1998-99,This is a small price to pay to restore to health this vital sector of our economy.
11263,1998-99,Over the years the scheme of Modvat credit has been considerably liberalised.
11264,1998-99,"However, the amount of Modvat credit availed has grown unexpectedly fast in recent years, suggesting misuse of the Modvat credit scheme in the absence of a 27 comprehensive computer net work for crosschecking modvatable invoices from a flung ranges."
11265,1998-99,"Until such a computer network becomes functional, and as a transitional measure, I propose to restrict the availability of Modvat credit by 5% of the duty paid in the case of inputs used in the manufacture of excisable goods."
11266,1998-99,"However, no restriction is placed on the Modvat credit in respect of capital goods."
11267,1998-99,My proposals regarding other changes in excise duty are guided by the overall need to rationalise the ratestructure so as to reduce the multiplicity of rates and ensure convergence towards a mean rate of 18% ad valorem.
11268,1998-99,"An ideal tax structure would be one where, barring the mean rate, there is one lower rate for items deserving concession and a higher rate for what may be described as demerit goods."
11269,1998-99,This would minimise the oscillations in rates and call for compression of intermediate rates.
11270,1998-99,"As a first step towards a convergence to the mean rate, I propose to impose excise duty of 8% on certain commodities."
11271,1998-99,These include : * Packaged tea *
11272,1998-99,"Branded butter, cheese and ghee *"
11273,1998-99,"Sewing machines, other than hand operated * Branded spices * Branded edible preparations when produced in factories * Preparations of meat and fish sold under a brand name *"
11274,1998-99,Skimmed milk powder other than for infant feeding *
11275,1998-99,Tractors not exceeding 1800 cc *
11276,1998-99,I also propose to charge excise duty on exempted articles of plastics at a flat rate of 5% on clearances in excess of Rs 1 crore in a financial year.
11277,1998-99,"In the same spirit, I propose to increase the excise duty on medical instruments and appliances as also on pollution control equipment from 5% to 8%."
11278,1998-99,A good number of commodities are subject to excise duty at 8%.
11279,1998-99,Some of them can bear a higher duty.
11280,1998-99,"I , therefore, propose to increase the excise duty on these commodities to 13%."
11281,1998-99,"As a result, malt, certain types of cartons, medical furniture, sun glasses and unrecorded audio cassettes will henceforth be subjected to duty at 13%."
11282,1998-99,"As a measure of rationalisation, I propose to increase the duty on arms and ammunition from 18% to 25%."
11283,1998-99,"I, however, assure the House that arms and ammunition for the military services will continue to be exempt from excise duty."
11284,1998-99,I propose to raise the duty on multiutility vehicles from 25% to 30% and on solid or cushion tyres also from 25% to 30%.
11285,1998-99,I also propose to raise the duty on marble tiles from Rs 30 square metre.
11286,1998-99,My proposals also include reduction of excise duty on: *
11287,1998-99,Effluent treatment plants from 13% to 8% * Diesel engine sets upto 10 HP from 13% to 8% *
11288,1998-99,Surgical and medical examination gloves from 18% to 8% *
11289,1998-99,Potassium iodate from 18% to 8% *
11290,1998-99,Electronic calculators from 18% to 8% * Pagers from 18% to 13% * Cellophane from 25% to 18%.
11291,1998-99,PVC compound from 25% to 18%.
11292,1998-99,I propose to exempt 100% woodfree particle boards and fibre boards made from agrobased residues from excise duty.
11293,1998-99,"Henceforth, cement bonded particle board, jute particle board, rice husk board, glass fibre reinforced gypsum board, sisal fibre board and bagasse board will also be free from excise duty."
11294,1998-99,"I also propose to exempt blocks and bricks containing more than 25% fly ash, ready mixed concrete, jute blankets and jute felt from excise duty."
11295,1998-99,"Henceforth, pultruded jute articles shall also be free from excise duty."
11296,1998-99,I propose to exempt recorded audio cassettes from excise duty.
11297,1998-99,I also propose to exempt recorded video cassettes intended for television broadcasting from excise duty.
11298,1998-99,The exemption for computer software will now be broadbanded to cover all software.
11299,1998-99,The domestic nylon industry is stagnating for various reasons.
11300,1998-99,I propose to reduce the duty on nylon filament yarn from 30% to 25%.
11301,1998-99,Finance Ministers are often criticised by the tax payers for their compulsive habit to increase the burden of taxes.
11302,1998-99,"However, such complaint cannot be justified by compulsive smokers."
11303,1998-99,I propose to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by varying degrees ranging from 6% to 11% of the specific rates.
11304,1998-99,I have no intention of being harsh on smokers all the way.
11305,1998-99,"Accordingly, I propose to reduce excise duty on matches manufactured in the cottage sector by half from Rs 0.50 to Rs 0.25 per hundred boxes."
11306,1998-99,A smaller reduction is also being made in respect of matches manufactured by other sectors.
11307,1998-99,High rates of duties are known to induce evasion and avoidance.
11308,1998-99,I propose to reduce the excise duty on alcoholbased toilet preparations from 100% to 50%.
11309,1998-99,I expect that this will improve compliance and States will get more revenue.
11310,1998-99,The Maximum Retail Price MRP based excise levy introduced last year in respect of certain products has been welcomed by the industry.
11311,1998-99,This scheme provides 29 for simplification and certainty in taxation.
11312,1998-99,"I propose to extend this scheme to a few more commodities, such as chocolates, malted food preparations, glazed tiles, razor blades, radio sets, domestic electrical appliances and pan masala."
11313,1998-99,"In the last budget, a number of services were added in the tax net."
11314,1998-99,These included the service rendered on transportation of goods by road.
11315,1998-99,The House is aware that it led to wide spread resistance and protests.
11316,1998-99,"As a result, this service tax was virtually kept in abeyance and rightly so."
11317,1998-99,I have decided to abolish the service tax on transportation of goods by road.
11318,1998-99,I have also decided to abolish the service tax payable by outdoor caterers and pandal contractors.
11319,1998-99,"However, I have proposed service tax on some new services."
11320,1998-99,These are services provided by : * Architects * Interior decorators *
11321,1998-99,Company Secretaries * Private security services *
11322,1998-99,Real estate agents and real estate consultants *
11323,1998-99,"Slaughter houses using mechanised means for large animals We will examine how in respect of certain segments liable to Service Tax, the manner and mode of payment could be further simplified to improve compliance."
11324,1998-99,These new service taxes will yield Rs 220 crore in a full year.
11325,1998-99,"My proposals relating to customs duties are estimated to result in a net gain of Rs 3,304 crore in one year."
11326,1998-99,"In case of excise duties, my proposals are estimated to result in gain of Rs 5,009 crore."
11327,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, there can be no two opinions that we must increase the level of voluntary compliance and our tax procedures should be simple, transparent and hassle free."
11328,1998-99,Our tax laws are yet to achieve this objective even though considerable efforts have been made in the past.
11329,1998-99,Our laws are not in tune with the need of the times.
11330,1998-99,It is imperative that they should be rebuilt on a comprehensive basis and modified to make them truly modern.
11331,1998-99,I am conscious that it is not an easy task.
11332,1998-99,But it is also not impossible.
11333,1998-99,I have decided to set up an Expert Group to recast the central excise law.
11334,1998-99,It will be my Government’s endeavour to bring a new excise law before Parliament in the next budget session of this House.
11335,1998-99,The government have also decided to set up a Settlement Commission for settlement of certain categories of disputes relating to customs and excise duties.
11336,1998-99,The details of the scheme are contained in the Finance Bill.
11337,1998-99,I also propose to set up an authority for Advance Tax Rulings for Excise and Customs in view of the need for foreign investors to be assured in advance of their likely indirect tax liability.
11338,1998-99,A bill to this effect will be introduced in Parliament in due course of time.
11339,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with our courage, determination and conviction, we freed ourselves from the British Raj more than fifty years ago."
11340,1998-99,This year the nation takes pride in celebrating the 50th year of Independence.
11341,1998-99,"Our trade and industry, however, is still not free from another Raj, namely, the Inspector Raj."
11342,1998-99,We are committed to put an end to this in the shortest possible time.
11343,1998-99,"I am of the view that we owe it to our taxpayers to provide a competent, efficient, sensitive and responsive tax administration."
11344,1998-99,"Indeed, it is long overdue."
11345,1998-99,There is a widespread feeling that the operation and implementation of excise laws leads to harassment of the assessees.
11346,1998-99,We are earnestly desirous of bringing about systemic changes to remedy the situation.
11347,1998-99,"Some of the more important measures that are proposed, are: *"
11348,1998-99,Minimising the contact points between the officials and assessees *
11349,1998-99,Reducing areas which require permission or approval *
11350,1998-99,Providing respectability to orders passed by Commissioner Appeals and the Tribunal *
11351,1998-99,Simplifying the procedure for second appeal in Modvat cases *
11352,1998-99,Restricting factory visits by the staff 176.
11353,1998-99,I am conscious of the fact that there is strong resentment against the procedures and legal obligations relating to service tax.
11354,1998-99,I have removed a number of obnoxious and deterrent provisions in law.
11355,1998-99,I also propose to abolish several of the redundant and irritating central excise rules very shortly.
11356,1998-99,"On the customs side, I have decided to strengthen the initiatives already taken in the form of Fast Track Clearance Systems and the SelfAssessment System in import clearance."
11357,1998-99,Computerisation in both Customs and Central Excise departments will be completed expeditiously so that information can be obtained from the assessees and the importers and exporters through electronic media thereby reducing contact between the assessees and the department.
11358,1998-99,I am introducing a new culture of timebound action by officials of the Customs and Central Excise department.
11359,1998-99,A Citizens’ Charter is being released shortly to lay down the citizen’s rights and the obligations cast on the customs and excise officials.
11360,1998-99,Copies of notifications giving effect to the above changes in customs and excise duties will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
11361,1998-99,"Finally, I have something to say on behalf of my Hon’ble colleague, the Minister of Communications."
11362,1998-99,Postal service is highly employmentintensive and salary and allowances constitute a major part of the operating expenses of the postal department.
11363,1998-99,A revision of tariff for postal services has become unavoidable.
11364,1998-99,"However, in the interest of the common man and the role of the print media in a democracy, there will be no change in the tariff for postcard and registered newspapers."
11365,1998-99,"However, the rate of competition postcard is being raised from Rs 2 to Rs 3, Inland letter from Re.1 to Rs 1.50, letter from Rs 2 to Rs 3 for every 20 gms. or part thereof and parcels from Rs 8 to Rs 10 for every 500 gms."
11366,1998-99,There are also certain other changes which are explained in the Memorandum circulated along with the budget documents.
11367,1998-99,The changes would take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed.
11368,1998-99,The revisions proposed are estimated to yield an additional revenue of about Rs 270 crore in a full year and about Rs 180 crore in 199899.
11369,1998-99,"Even this modest increase, which is necessary for sustaining postal development, will only partially meet the cost of postal services leaving an uncovered postal deficit of about Rs 695 crore."
11370,1998-99,"As a result of my tax proposals and the postal tariff revision, total expenditure of the Central government for the year 199899 would be marginally reduced to Rs 2,67,927 crore while the net revenue receipts and nondebt capital receipts would increase to Rs 1,76,902 crore."
11371,1998-99,"The revenue deficit is placed at Rs 48,068 crore which is 3% of GDP."
11372,1998-99,"The fiscal deficit is placed at Rs 91,025 crore which is 5.6% of GDP."
11373,1998-99,"With the present state of the economy and in view of the need for expenditure stimulus to growth, I believe further compression is not warranted this year."
11374,1998-99,"Sir, it is my firm conviction that in the days to come India will stand tall on the world’s stage because of our commitment to democracy and the pursuit of prosperity."
11375,1998-99,"I call upon you to join us to strengthen freedom and opportunity, I call upon you to join us to build a better future for every man, woman and child."
11376,1998-99,"As we move together and with discipline, the future is ours."
11377,1998-99,In the words of Ramdhari Singh Dinkar : 1 8 3 .
11378,1998-99,"BÉE®Éä |ÉaÉÉhÉ +É£ÉaÉ, £ÉÉ ́ÉÉÒ <ÉÊiÉcÉoÉ iÉÖàcÉ®É cè; aÉä xÉJÉiÉ +ÉàÉÉ BÉEä ¤ÉÖZÉiÉä cé, oÉÉ®É +ÉÉBÉEÉ¶É iÉÖàcÉ®É cè* Rise O’ warrior march ahead undaunted You are the Creator of future history The stars of the dark night are fading The whole sky belongs to you."
11379,1998-99,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget"
11380,1999-2000,I rise to present the budget for the year 19992000.
11381,1999-2000,"For the first time after Independence with the enthusiastic support of all political parties in Parliament, it has been possible for me to discard the long standing tradition of British Raj of presenting the budget at 5 PM."
11382,1999-2000,A new beginning is being made today as I present the last Budget of 1900’s.
11383,1999-2000,I assure you this is not the only new feature.
11384,1999-2000,There are many more in this budget.
11385,1999-2000,The decade of the nineties has witnessed extraordinary changes.
11386,1999-2000,It began with the collapse of the centrally planned economies; it is ending with market economies facing a serious crisis.
11387,1999-2000,The year 1998 particularly has been a year of unprecedented global turmoil.
11388,1999-2000,The East Asian financial crisis took a heavy toll of important economies in the region and spread to other countries.
11389,1999-2000,Japan continued in recession and in August 1998 severe crisis afflicted Russia.
11390,1999-2000,"By January 1999, the contagion had spread to Brazil triggering massive capital flight and a steep depreciation of the currency."
11391,1999-2000,"World output growth dropped below 2%, the growth of world trade decelerated sharply, commodity prices fell steeply, currencies were savaged and capital flows to developing countries declined sharply."
11392,1999-2000,"In India, we had to contend with the additional challenge of economic sanctions imposed on us after the Pokhran nuclear tests."
11393,1999-2000,"While we have not remained unaffected by these developments, we have reasons to be satisfied at the way we have withstood the impact of these challenges."
11394,1999-2000,"Despite the hostile economic 1 2 environment, our GDP growth in 199899 has accelerated to 5.8% compared to 5% last year."
11395,1999-2000,Our farmers have led the way with 5.3% growth in agriculture and allied sectors.
11396,1999-2000,"Since the beginning of 199899, we have added $2 billion to our foreign currency reserves as of February 23, 1999 and we have successfully curbed undue volatility in the forex market."
11397,1999-2000,The current account deficit in the balance of payments is estimated at a modest 1.4% of GDP compared to 1.6% in 199798.
11398,1999-2000,"Although inflation had risen sharply during the year, we have succeeded in bringing it down to below 5% now."
11399,1999-2000,All this is described in detail in the Economic Survey presented to Parliament a few days ago.
11400,1999-2000,"However, there is no room for complacency."
11401,1999-2000,"The challenges before us, both international and domestic, remain grave."
11402,1999-2000,"The fiscal and revenue deficits of both Centre and States are still too high and are undermining our ability to bring down interest rates, stimulate investment and growth, curb inflationary potential, generate resources for priority, noninterest expenditure needs and raise exports."
11403,1999-2000,"Above all, despite our continuing concern year after year, we have made only a limited impact on the problems of poverty and unemployment."
11404,1999-2000,The various schemes of the Government in this area lack focus and convergence.
11405,1999-2000,The delivery systems need to be cost effective and community based.
11406,1999-2000,"The fruits of economic development should largely reach the poor and the vulnerable specially the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes who, in turn, need to be empowered fully."
11407,1999-2000,"Without this, I am afraid, our planning will be devoid of any direction."
11408,1999-2000,The broad strategy of this Budget therefore is sixfold:
11409,1999-2000,Undertake a major reform of indirect taxes to promote productivity and employment.
11410,1999-2000,"Deepen and widen economic reforms in all major sectors and accelerate internal liberalization to release the productive energies and creativity of our farmers, manufacturers, traders and service providers."
11411,1999-2000,"Safeguard the economy from external shocks, revive exports and stimulate the domestic engines for growth revival."
11412,1999-2000,Strengthen the knowledgebased industries and thus prepare ourselves for the challenges of the new millennium.
11413,1999-2000,"Last but not the least * Revitalise and redirect public programmes for human development, encompassing food security, health care, education, employment and shelter."
11414,1999-2000,"Their focus should be on empowering the poor and the weaker sections, especially those belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes."
11415,1999-2000,Agriculture and Rural Development 9.
11416,1999-2000,This year’s growth performance has once again underlined the critical importance of agriculture in our economy.
11417,1999-2000,I propose a multi pronged programme to further strengthen our rural economy.
11418,1999-2000,"On water, which is the lifeblood of agriculture, I propose the following initiatives: *"
11419,1999-2000,"It is important to unify the multiplicity of watershed development programmes within the framework of a single national initiative  a National Movement of Watershed Development that fosters implementation ability at the local level and creates community infrastructure for micro watershed projects through active involvement of Gram Panchayats, Local Self Help Groups and NGOs."
11420,1999-2000,"For this, a Watershed Development Fund will be established with NABARD to cover 100 priority districts within 3 years."
11421,1999-2000,The Central Government will provide necessary matching assistance to NABARD.
11422,1999-2000,"This will create income generating opportunities for the landless and the poor; especially those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes."
11423,1999-2000,The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme aims to expedite the completion of ongoing irrigation projects by providing matching assistance to States.
11424,1999-2000,"However, the water rates in most States do not even cover full Operations and Maintenance costs."
11425,1999-2000,"To encourage better management and maintenance of costly irrigation assets, the Centre will provide larger financial assistance to States that rationalise their water rates to cover at least O&M costs."
11426,1999-2000,"In order to promote farmer participation in water management, the Centre will provide a one time management subsidy and recurring assistance over an initial period of 3 years to all registered Water Users Associations, linked to incremental water rate collection."
11427,1999-2000,This will supplement the States’ own contribution.
11428,1999-2000,Water and credit must flow together for maximum impact.
11429,1999-2000,"Last year, I had announced a number of initiatives for improving the flow of credit from the banking sector to agriculture."
11430,1999-2000,"I am happy to report to this House that institutional credit flow to agriculture has shown a 20% increase in the current year, taking the level to about Rs 38,000 crore as compared to Rs 31,698 crore in the previous year."
11431,1999-2000,I propose to take the following further measures for improving flow of agricultural and rural credit: *
11432,1999-2000,The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF has emerged as an important scheme for financing rural infrastructure projects of the State Governments.
11433,1999-2000,"Last year, I had announced an allocation of Rs 3,000 crore from the banking sector under RIDF IV."
11434,1999-2000,I propose to continue the scheme.
11435,1999-2000,"The corpus of RIDF V will be raised to Rs 3,500 crore."
11436,1999-2000,The repayment period is also being extended from five to seven years.
11437,1999-2000,"The scope of RIDF will also be widened to allow lending to Gram Panchayats, SelfHelp Groups and other eligible organisations for implementing village level infrastructure projects."
11438,1999-2000,"In line with my announcement last year, the Kisan Credit Card Scheme has been launched by all public sector banks."
11439,1999-2000,These Cards provide timely credit to farmers in a flexible and cost effective manner.
11440,1999-2000,"So far, six lakh Kisan Credit Cards have been issued."
11441,1999-2000,I am asking public sector banks to 4 extend the coverage so that twenty lakh farmers can benefit from this scheme in the coming year.
11442,1999-2000,The reform measures initiated to strengthen and restructure the Regional Rural Banks will continue.
11443,1999-2000,A provision of Rs 168 crore is being made for recapitalisation of RRBs.
11444,1999-2000,"Micro enterprises have great potential for generating productive employment, especially in rural areas."
11445,1999-2000,NABARD and SIDBI have launched schemes for promotion of Self Help Groups and NGOs as a channel for flow of funds to micro enterprises.
11446,1999-2000,"Following last budget’s initiative, NABARD is likely to cover about 15,000 Self Help Groups in 199899, as against the target of 10,000."
11447,1999-2000,"I am asking NABARD and SIDBI to redouble their efforts in this direction and ensure coverage of at least 50,000 Self Help Groups during the course of the next year."
11448,1999-2000,"To augment the flow of credit for food and agro processing industries, lending by banks to this sector will be treated as priority sector lending."
11449,1999-2000,"Today, we have a very weak postharvest storage and marketing infrastructure."
11450,1999-2000,This causes tremendous national loss.
11451,1999-2000,"To overcome this problem, I propose to introduce a new creditlinked capital subsidy scheme for construction of cold storages and godowns."
11452,1999-2000,"This scheme, which will be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture with the help of NABARD, will help create additional cold storage capacity of 12 lakh tonnes and will rehabilitate and modernise 8 lakh tonnes of existing units over the next few years."
11453,1999-2000,We also propose to create 4.5 lakh tonnes of onion storage capacity.
11454,1999-2000,"This House, especially the main opposition party, can readily appreciate our special concern for onions."
11455,1999-2000,Fragmentation of agricultural land holdings undermines productive use of land.
11456,1999-2000,Some States have lagged behind in attending to this important task of land reforms.
11457,1999-2000,"To accelerate reforms in this direction, the Central Government will provide special financial assistance to States, which undertake this task."
11458,1999-2000,One of the problems with effective distribution and use of fertilizer is the mismatch between its demand and availability at the onset of the sowing operations.
11459,1999-2000,"In order to tackle this problem, I propose to experiment with an incentive discount to farmers for lifting fertilizer from the cooperative societies during the lean months of April and May."
11460,1999-2000,"The ongoing schemes for the development of degraded and wastelands will be reoriented to permit local Self Help Groups and the landless poor, specially Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes, to develop and utilise such lands in each village."
11461,1999-2000,The whole programme will be based on participatory management with the Gram Panchayat having a pivotal role.
11462,1999-2000,"During 19992000, we will earmark a total amount of Rs 50 crore to take up this scheme on an experimental basis in those States that are prepared to put in a matching contribution."
11463,1999-2000,National Programme for Rural Industrialisation NPRI 16.
11464,1999-2000,"Rural Industrialisation is important for creating employment opportunities, raising rural incomes and strengthening agricultureindustry linkages."
11465,1999-2000,"Thus far, it has been pursued by a multiplicity of government agencies."
11466,1999-2000,"However, the impact of 5 these programmes at the grass roots level has remained modest."
11467,1999-2000,We must integrate the efforts of the various government agencies and ensure active community participation.
11468,1999-2000,"Accordingly, I propose a National Programme for Rural Industrialisation NPRI with the mission to set up 100 rural clusters every year to give a boost to rural industrialisation."
11469,1999-2000,This is being done for the benefit of rural artisans and unemployed youth.
11470,1999-2000,"In the long run, it will reduce rural urban disparities."
11471,1999-2000,The Small Industry Development Organisation will coordinate this programme.
11472,1999-2000,The Khadi and Village Industries Commission KVIC will play an important role in this.
11473,1999-2000,The marketing infrastructure available with KVIC would be put to optimum use in this effort.
11474,1999-2000,It will go a long way in the marketing of rural industrial products if KVIC could develop its own brand name for the purpose.
11475,1999-2000,"The proposed rural clusters will be spread throughout the country, with a reasonable balance between high potential and backward rural areas."
11476,1999-2000,National Human Development Initiative NHDI 17.
11477,1999-2000,"Even a halfcentury after Independence, the levels of human development in India lag behind most other countries."
11478,1999-2000,The essence of human development should be to empower vulnerable groups in society to take advantage of the process of development.
11479,1999-2000,"Empowerment, in my view, entails access to five basic requirements, namely, Food, Health Care, Education, Employment and Shelter."
11480,1999-2000,It is our resolve to make them available to the entire population of this country within a decade.
11481,1999-2000,"With this initiative for peoplecentred development, we will be implementing the Prime Minister’s mandate for ‘reforming the reforms’."
11482,1999-2000,"Food: The Targeted Public Distribution System has been designed to provide food security, especially to those below the poverty line, on the basis of susbidised foodgrain prices."
11483,1999-2000,"With greater involvement of Gram Panchayats in its supervision and implementation, the Targeted Public Distribution System will be suitably strengthened to ensure its proper coverage and make it efficient."
11484,1999-2000,The Targeted Public Distribution System does not however adequately cover the indigent senior citizens who have no income of their own and none to take care of them in the village.
11485,1999-2000,"I propose to launch a new scheme, “Annapurna” in 19992000, to provide food security to such persons."
11486,1999-2000,The number of persons benefitting from the scheme will not for the present exceed 20% of the old age pensioners within that State.
11487,1999-2000,"The Gram Panchayat will be required to identify, prepare and display a list of such persons after giving wide publicity."
11488,1999-2000,The expansion and improvement of health infrastructure and services are key goals set out in the Special Action Plan announced by the Prime Minister.
11489,1999-2000,"While an extensive network for primary health care has been created in most rural areas, inadequate community participation and supervision has constrained use of these facilities to much below their capacity."
11490,1999-2000,"Our goal is to integrate and synergise the existing programmes for health care, family welfare, rural development and related areas in different Central Ministries and to deploy the available resources so that every household secures ready access to both primary health care and family welfare 6 services."
11491,1999-2000,The Central Government will provide funds to such Gram Panchayats that come forward with their own contribution to set up primary health care facilities in their respective areas.
11492,1999-2000,This will match similar assistance from the concerned State Government.
11493,1999-2000,Education: Access to primary education is critical for empowering people.
11494,1999-2000,Several States have recorded considerable success with their respective models of education guarantee schemes.
11495,1999-2000,I propose to implement an Education Guarantee Scheme at the national level.
11496,1999-2000,"The aim will be to provide an elementary school in every habitation, which does not have one within a radius of 1 km."
11497,1999-2000,"Initially, the local community would provide the premises and select a local person as a part time teacher."
11498,1999-2000,"Teaching material and other assistance will be provided by the Central and the State Governments, while Gram Panchayats will mobilise contribution from the local community in cash and kind for running the school for at least two years."
11499,1999-2000,"After the school has functioned successfully for two years, it will be upgraded on a permanent basis."
11500,1999-2000,At least 1.8 lakh such schools will become operational during the next three years of the Ninth Plan.
11501,1999-2000,The resources available under the existing Centrally sponsored education schemes will be mobilised to support this important initiative.
11502,1999-2000,"This initiative will provide an opportunity to the rural poor, especially those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes to secure education for their children."
11503,1999-2000,This is the first and most important step towards their empowerment.
11504,1999-2000,"At present, a variety of selfemployment and wage employment schemes are in operation."
11505,1999-2000,"To enhance the effectiveness of these schemes in generating incomeearning opportunities for the rural poor, Government will follow a four pronged strategy with the common theme of ensuring greater involvement of Panchayati Raj institutions: *"
11506,1999-2000,The existing scheme of Jawahar Rozgar Yojana will be modified to ensure that all funds are placed at the disposal of Gram Panchayats for creation of rural infrastructure.
11507,1999-2000,"They will have the sole authority for preparation of annual action plans and their implementation, including the power to execute works with the approval of the Gram Sabha."
11508,1999-2000,The modified scheme will be called “Gram Samridhi Yojana”.
11509,1999-2000,"The wage employment programme of Employment Assurance Scheme will be implemented at the district/block levels, with the selection of works being decided by the Zila Parishads in consultation with the other elected representatives."
11510,1999-2000,The Employment Assurance Scheme presently operates through out the country.
11511,1999-2000,We will give special priority to areas suffering from endemic labour exodus.
11512,1999-2000,The Gram Panchayat will maintain a live employment register available to the Gram Sabha and public for scrutiny.
11513,1999-2000,"To ensure that the funds under the wage employment schemes are spent with the active involvement of the elected Panchayati Raj institutions, it is proposed that while 80% of funds would be released to implementing agencies as per normal procedure, the remaining 20% will be released as an incentive only if the State has put in place elected and empowered Panchayati Raj institutions."
11514,1999-2000,"The plethora of selfemployment programmes for the rural poor will be merged into a single programme called “Swaran Jayanti Gram SwaRozgar Yojana”, which will have greater participation of the Gram Panchayats."
11515,1999-2000,This will enable the implementing agencies to have greater flexibility in execution to meet the needs of the local people.
11516,1999-2000,"These schemes will largely benefit the poor and the unemployed youth in the rural areas, especially those belonging to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes."
11517,1999-2000,"The rural housing shortage at the beginning of 199798 was estimated at nearly 140 lakh units, which included shelterless households and those with only kutcha dwellings."
11518,1999-2000,Government’s priority will be to provide shelter to all shelterless poor households by the end of the Ninth Plan.
11519,1999-2000,The task of upgradation of kutcha dwellings of poor households will be completed by the end of the Tenth Plan.
11520,1999-2000,"Furthermore, to ensure integrated provision of shelter, sanitation and drinking water, we propose to launch a comprehensive “Samagra Awas Yojana”, which will embrace existing programmes including Indira Awas Yojana."
11521,1999-2000,The National Human Development Initiative will go a long way in empowering the weakest sections of the population and improving the quality of rural life.
11522,1999-2000,This will minimise the ruralurban disparities.
11523,1999-2000,"The effectiveness of this initiative will depend critically on the extent to which the Gram Panchayat, as an elected body, can assume a pivotal role in implementing the various components of the programmes."
11524,1999-2000,"I propose to declare 19992000 as the “Year of the Gram Sabha” to affirm our resolve to set the process of decentralised democracy in motion, with human development as the core objective of planning."
11525,1999-2000,"Turning to shelter in urban areas, we have already taken major steps for encouraging housing development, including repeal of the Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act."
11526,1999-2000,"To improve the flow of credit for housing I propose the following measures: * To develop the primary and secondary market for housing mortgages, it is necessary to simplify the present legal provisions for foreclosure and transfer of property."
11527,1999-2000,I propose to make necessary changes in the foreclosure laws in the housing sector through amendments in the National Housing Bank Act.
11528,1999-2000,"To strengthen housing finance companies, I will be proposing changes in the tax treatment of the income earned on nonperforming assets."
11529,1999-2000,"To enhance the availability of banking funds to the housing sector, RBI will be advising scheduled commercial banks to lend up to 3% of their incremental deposits for housing finance."
11530,1999-2000,National Housing Bank is implementing the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme for which I announced a target of 1 lakh dwelling units last year.
11531,1999-2000,"Encouraged by the satisfactory response to this scheme, I propose to increase this target by 25% to 1.25 lakh dwelling units during 1999 2000."
11532,1999-2000,"The National Housing Bank has proposed a scheme, which entails a reduction in the interest rates for small borrowers."
11533,1999-2000,The scheme will be available in towns where Urban Land Ceiling and Regulation Act is not applicable.
11534,1999-2000,We will provide necessary support to NHB for this purpose.
11535,1999-2000,The details of the scheme would be announced by NHB.
11536,1999-2000,The development of housing in urban areas also depends heavily on the quality of urban services.
11537,1999-2000,Many of our municipal bodies are at present financially too weak to provide basic services.
11538,1999-2000,"To encourage these bodies to improve their creditworthiness in financial markets, I propose to accord taxfree status to a limited amount of municipal bonds issued each year."
11539,1999-2000,"A little later, I shall be announcing far reaching tax initiatives to promote housing."
11540,1999-2000,I am deeply conscious that the last two years have been difficult for Indian industry in the context of growing integration with the world economy and the inevitable uncertainties of the global market place.
11541,1999-2000,But we should also be proud of the way Indian industry has surmounted difficult challenges and produced world class winners in a number of fields such as information technology and pharmaceuticals.
11542,1999-2000,The process of corporate and industrial restructuring in the face of new challenges is inevitable.
11543,1999-2000,"To help this transition, I shall be announcing important tax initiatives to facilitate corporate mergers and amalgamations."
11544,1999-2000,The Industries Development and Regulation Act will be reviewed and amended so that the primary focus is shifted to development of industry rather than its regulation.
11545,1999-2000,The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act has become obsolete in certain areas in the light of international economic developments relating to competition laws.
11546,1999-2000,We need to shift our focus from curbing monopolies to promoting competition.
11547,1999-2000,Government has decided to appoint a Committee to examine this range of issues and propose a modern Competition Law suitable for our conditions.
11548,1999-2000,The Prime Minister’s Advisory Council on Trade and Industry has made important recommendations regarding knowledgebased industries.
11549,1999-2000,The pharmaceutical industry is one of the important knowledgebased industries where we have comparative advantage.
11550,1999-2000,We must strengthen our drug industry’s research and development capabilities.
11551,1999-2000,Government has decided to set up two High Level Committees to review the present drug policy so as to reduce the rigours of price controls where they have become counterproductive and also to identify required support to Indian pharmaceutical companies to undertake domestic R&D.
11552,1999-2000,"My colleague, the Minister of Chemicals and Fertilizers will be making a separate announcement regarding this initiative."
11553,1999-2000,"Further, in order to promote foreign direct investment in this sector, Government has decided to permit up to 74% equity under the automatic route."
11554,1999-2000,"While we devote our attention to the new sunrise industries, we have not neglected established industries like textiles, which employs 380 lakh workers and accounts for about 20% of our manufacturing valued added."
11555,1999-2000,The Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme has been approved by the Government and will become 9 operational from April 1999.
11556,1999-2000,For the next five years it will provide a substantial interest incentive of 5% on loans availed by textile units from financial institutions and banks.
11557,1999-2000,"It will cover weaving, knitting, processing and finishing units, garment manufacturing, cotton ginning and processing and the jute industry."
11558,1999-2000,The scheme is being extended to include the spinning industry also.
11559,1999-2000,"In the National Agenda for Governance, my Government has already proclaimed our commitment to the Handloom sector for providing services, technical and marketing facilities for handloom weavers."
11560,1999-2000,"In the area of marketing, I propose to introduce a new integrated handloom promotion scheme, Deen Dayal Hathkargha Protshahan Yojana which would encourage processing facilities, new design inputs to weavers and opening new avenues for marketing of handloom fabrics."
11561,1999-2000,"Government has already undertaken important legislative and other reform initiatives in key infrastructure sectors such as power, telecom, roads and ports."
11562,1999-2000,The Sethusamudram Ship Canal Project will provide a shorter sea route between the Eastern and the Western ports of our country.
11563,1999-2000,I propose to provide funds during 19992000 to examine the technoeconomic feasibility of this much awaited project.
11564,1999-2000,"Last year, I had announced a number of initiatives to improve the availability of credit to the SSI Sector."
11565,1999-2000,Credit delivery to this sector continues to pose challenges to our banking sector.
11566,1999-2000,I propose the following initiatives to improve the delivery system for credit to SSI units: *
11567,1999-2000,The composite loan scheme of SIDBI and commercial banks is designed to ease operational difficulties of the small borrowers by providing term loan and working capital through a single window.
11568,1999-2000,The limit for composite loans is currently Rs 2 lakh.
11569,1999-2000,I propose to increase this limit to Rs 5 lakh.
11570,1999-2000,"To simplify the computation of working capital limits of SSI units, last year I had announced that for SSI units having an aggregate turn over of Rs 4 crore, working capital limit would be fixed at 20% of the annual turnover."
11571,1999-2000,I propose to increase this limit to Rs 5 crore.
11572,1999-2000,"In line with the recommendations of a high powered committee appointed by it, RBI had advised banks to delegate more powers to branch managers to grant ad hoc limits, to simplify application forms, to fix their own norms for assessment of credit requirement and open more SSI branches."
11573,1999-2000,These measures should ease the flow of bank credit to SSI units.
11574,1999-2000,"To increase the outreach of banks to the tiny sector, lending by banks to non banking finance companies or other financial intermediaries for purposes of onlending to the tiny sector is being included within the definition of priority sector for bank lending."
11575,1999-2000,The problem is more acute for export oriented and tiny sector enterprises.
11576,1999-2000,"To alleviate this problem, a new credit insurance scheme will be launched."
11577,1999-2000,The time has come to unleash the creative potential of our scientists and innovators at grass roots level.
11578,1999-2000,Only then we can make India truly selfreliant and a leader in sustainable technologies.
11579,1999-2000,I propose a national foundation for helping innovators all over the country.
11580,1999-2000,"This Fund, with an initial corpus of Rs 20 crore, will build a national register of innovations, mobilise intellectual property protection, set up incubators for converting innovations into viable business opportunities and help in dissemination across the country."
11581,1999-2000,Our research institutions have the capacity to evolve new vaccines that will revolutionise the medical and health systems.
11582,1999-2000,We propose to set up a Technology Mission on vaccines to provide a focus to the effort.
11583,1999-2000,"Our country is endowed with diverse and precious genetic resources, which need to be prudently conserved and managed."
11584,1999-2000,"Among the 18 hot spots of biodiversity in the world, two happen to be in India, in the Eastern Himalayas and the Western Ghats respectively."
11585,1999-2000,"To coordinate policies, research, documentation and legal protection of the country’s rights in this important area, a National Bioresources Board NBB will be set up under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Science and Technology."
11586,1999-2000,Last year I had announced important decisions flowing from the Narasimham Committee Report on Banking Sector Reforms.
11587,1999-2000,"Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of India has taken further follow up action."
11588,1999-2000,I propose to carry forward the reform process: *
11589,1999-2000,The high level of NPAs in our public sector banks continues to remain a cause of concern.
11590,1999-2000,"The Debt Recovery Tribunals, which were set up for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions, have started showing encouraging results."
11591,1999-2000,Government has decided to set up 5 more DRTs and 4 more Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals.
11592,1999-2000,I also propose to introduce a Bill in the current session of Parliament to make certain amendments in the Recovery of Debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act to strengthen its provisions.
11593,1999-2000,A Working Group has recently been set up by us to devise appropriate strategies for dealing with the problem of restructuring weak banks including their NPAs.
11594,1999-2000,The inability of banks to enter into timely compromise settlements of chronic cases of overdue loans leads to locking up of banks’ funds and long drawn litigation in recovery suits.
11595,1999-2000,"Public sector banks will be encouraged to set up Settlement Advisory Committees so that such chronic cases, specially those relating to the small sector, are settled in a timely and speedy manner."
11596,1999-2000,RBI will be issuing necessary guidelines to the banks in this regard.
11597,1999-2000,Our banks are required to observe RBI norms for maintaining provisions against doubtful and nonperforming assets.
11598,1999-2000,These norms have been strengthened in recent years.
11599,1999-2000,To assist banks to come up to international 11 standards of prudential norms I shall be announcing certain changes in the tax deductibility of provisions made.
11600,1999-2000,"To strengthen our external payments situation, we need to revitalise our exports and encourage more nondebt inflows in the form of foreign investment."
11601,1999-2000,The following steps will be taken: *
11602,1999-2000,The existing scheme of export credit in foreign currency is being revamped to make available preshipment and postshipment credit at internationally competitive rates and bring about major simplification of procedures.
11603,1999-2000,The RBI will separately announce the details.
11604,1999-2000,"Studies show that our exporters are handicapped by high transaction costs related to foreign trade licensing, tax procedures and the banking system."
11605,1999-2000,I am establishing a high powered committee under the Revenue Secretary to go into this problem and make concrete recommendations for reduction in such transaction costs within three months.
11606,1999-2000,"In order to make inflows of foreign direct investment hassle free, the Government has decided to expand the list of automatic approvals covering important industrial and services sectors."
11607,1999-2000,The expanded list will be announced separately by the Minister of Industry.
11608,1999-2000,"Wherever FIPB clearance is required, henceforth FIPB will give the decision within 30 days."
11609,1999-2000,There have been complaints about slow implementation of foreign direct investment FDI approvals.
11610,1999-2000,"To ensure that such approvals are quickly translated into actual investment inflows and projects, Government has decided to create a Foreign Investment Implementation Authority FIIA within the Ministry of Industry, which may also include representatives of State Governments."
11611,1999-2000,Households and various charitable and religious institutions hold a huge amount of gold in the country.
11612,1999-2000,"These are idle assets earning no income for the holders, who often incur costs to ensure security."
11613,1999-2000,This is a somewhat anomalous situation considering that the country spends thousands of crore worth of foreign exchange each year to meet fresh demand for gold holding.
11614,1999-2000,"To mobilise this idle gold, I propose a new Gold Deposit Scheme."
11615,1999-2000,"Selected banks will be permitted to accept gold deposits and issue interest bearing certificates or bonds which, on maturity, can be reclaimed in gold."
11616,1999-2000,"This would free depositors from the problems of storage, movement and security for the gold in their possession, while providing them with a regular source of income."
11617,1999-2000,"For the country, by recycling idle gold, we should be able to reduce our dependence on imported gold."
11618,1999-2000,"To encourage this process, I propose to exempt the interest on the gold deposit bonds/certificates from Income Tax and the value of assets deposited in the gold deposit scheme from Wealth Tax."
11619,1999-2000,"Furthermore, any capital gains made on these gold bonds/ certificates through trading or at redemption will be exempt from capital gains tax."
11620,1999-2000,"I would also urge all State Governments to consider exempting movement of gold covered under the scheme from octroi, sales tax, stamp duty and similar levies."
11621,1999-2000,I must point out that the scheme will not enjoy 12 amnesty.
11622,1999-2000,The Reserve Bank will take necessary steps to implement the scheme.
11623,1999-2000,"In my last Budget, I had proposed a set of initiatives to strengthen the participation of NonResident Indians NRIs in the development of our country."
11624,1999-2000,"Encouraged by their response, I now propose a few more initiatives: *"
11625,1999-2000,"We shall extend the facility of automatic approval for investment up to 100% by NRIs/OCBs for all items, except those which attract notified FDI equity caps, or compulsory licensing or public sector reservation under the Industrial Policy or are reserved for the small scale sector."
11626,1999-2000,Our major stock exchanges have screenbased automated trading in securities.
11627,1999-2000,"It is now technically possible for them to open trading terminals abroad, which would facilitate the participation of NRIs in our capital markets."
11628,1999-2000,I have asked the Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI to work out the modalities for this purpose.
11629,1999-2000,The existing RBI approval mechanism for NRI investment in Indian mutual funds will be simplified to a postfacto reporting mechanism.
11630,1999-2000,A vibrant capital market is essential for providing the muchneeded funds for our infrastructure sector.
11631,1999-2000,"Infrastructure projects need long term funds, which, in turn, require a deep and wellfunctioning debt market."
11632,1999-2000,"With a view to modernising the debt market and introducing paperless trading in this segment also, Government proposes to abolish stamp duty on transfer of debt instruments within the depository mode."
11633,1999-2000,"Lately, there has been considerable debate on the importance of good governance of Indian corporates."
11634,1999-2000,"It is increasingly being realised that if investors have to be drawn back to the capital market, companies have to put their houses in order by following internationally accepted practices of corporate governance."
11635,1999-2000,This is necessary to enhance investor confidence.
11636,1999-2000,"To help promote this trend, I propose to institute a National Award for Excellence in Corporate Governance."
11637,1999-2000,"The Deepak Parekh Committee appointed by the UTI has made wideranging recommendations, including for restructuring of the US64 scheme and for granting tax incentives."
11638,1999-2000,We are taking necessary action.
11639,1999-2000,I will come to the tax incentives shortly.
11640,1999-2000,The details of the restructuring are being announced separately in a press release.
11641,1999-2000,This should lift the cloud of uncertainty from the capital market and restore confidence.
11642,1999-2000,My tax proposals will also greatly strengthen mutual funds and thereby help bring small retail investors back into the capital market.
11643,1999-2000,It has also been decided to set up a joint mechanism between SEBI and the Department of Company Affairs for taking stringent action against unscrupulous promoters who raise money from investors and misutilise them.
11644,1999-2000,The high rate of growth of nondevelopmental expenditure by Government is a growing and critical source of concern.
11645,1999-2000,I propose the following initiatives: *
11646,1999-2000,The most effective and lasting solution to this problem is to begin the process of downsizing Government.
11647,1999-2000,We are making an immediate beginning by 13 abolishing four Secretarylevel posts through a process of merger and rationalisation of Central Government departments.
11648,1999-2000,"This will take effect on April 1, 1999."
11649,1999-2000,"To carry this process forward in a systematic way towards reducing the role and the administrative structure of the Government, we will constitute an Expenditure Reforms Commission headed by an eminent and experienced person."
11650,1999-2000,"In preparation for the next Budget, I propose to initiate a system of Zero Base Budgeting."
11651,1999-2000,I encourage all State Governments to set up similar Funds.
11652,1999-2000,Public Sector Reform/Disinvestment/Privatisation 40.
11653,1999-2000,"Government’s strategy towards public sector enterprises will continue to encompass a judicious mix of strengthening strategic units, privatising nonstrategic ones through gradual disinvestment or strategic sale and devising viable rehabilitation strategies for weak units."
11654,1999-2000,The disinvestment programme of the Government draws primarily upon the recommendations of the Disinvestment Commission.
11655,1999-2000,The Commission has so far submitted 8 Reports containing recommendations for 43 Public Sector Enterprises PSEs.
11656,1999-2000,These recommendations are in various stages of implementation.
11657,1999-2000,Government will be referring more PSEs to it for its valued opinion.
11658,1999-2000,"In 19992000, I propose to raise Rs 10,000 crore through the disinvestment programme."
11659,1999-2000,This will help the Government to fund the requirements of social and infrastructure sectors.
11660,1999-2000,"Equally important, it will lead to improvements in productivity and profitability of these enterprises and also to the further development of domestic capital markets."
11661,1999-2000,Government have been providing budgetary support to Central PSEs for rationalising manpower under the Voluntary Retirement Scheme VRS.
11662,1999-2000,"However, such assistance has generally been restricted to loss making enterprises."
11663,1999-2000,There are a number of enterprises which are marginally profitmaking and which need to reduce manpower to remain viable but do not have the resource to finance such rationalisation exercises.
11664,1999-2000,Government would encourage such enterprises to raise money from banks against Government guarantees and interest subsidy.
11665,1999-2000,"In order to reduce the burden on budget on account of the implementation of VRS, Government will also encourage PSEs to issue bonds to the workers opting for VRS."
11666,1999-2000,Government will guarantee the repayment of such bonds and also reimburse fully the interest payments.
11667,1999-2000,RBI will be requested to issue necessary instructions to banks to accept bonds as collateral for loans to workers who may need assistance.
11668,1999-2000,The need for timely and reliable statistics for policy formulation and planning cannot be over emphasised.
11669,1999-2000,"There is reason to believe that with progressive dismantling of the system of economic controls, the quality of data flows has weakened."
11670,1999-2000,Government has decided to establish a National Statistical Commission to critically examine the deficiencies of the present statistical system with a view to recommending measures for a systematic revamping of the system.
11671,1999-2000,We stand today at the edge of the second millennium.
11672,1999-2000,"We must, therefore, prepare for the opportunities and challenges of the next century and millennium."
11673,1999-2000,It is time to seriously debate and decide on the second generation reforms that we must put in place to make India economically strong and fully capable of competing successfully in the evolving world order.
11674,1999-2000,"To further this process, I plan to bring a discussion paper before Parliament before the end of this Budget Session."
11675,1999-2000,"My goal is to help build a consensus on the basic issues so that we can act more decisively to raise the growth in income, output and employment in our economy to a higher, sustainable level."
11676,1999-2000,Revised Estimates for 199899 4 6 .
11677,1999-2000,"The nonPlan expenditure has increased by Rs 17,616 crore."
11678,1999-2000,"There is a shortfall of Rs 3,631 crore under Plan."
11679,1999-2000,"The normal nonPlan expenditure of the Government departments has increased only by Rs 2,539 crore."
11680,1999-2000,"The other increases are on account of loans to States and UTs against net Small Savings collections, Rs 9,588 crore, pension, Rs 2,711 crore, interest payments, Rs 2,248 crore, and postal deficit, Rs 530 crore."
11681,1999-2000,"Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated at Rs 1,09,537 crore against Rs 1,16,857 crore budgeted, reflecting a shortfall of Rs 7,320 crore."
11682,1999-2000,The shortfall is mainly due to lower customs revenue on account of both lower volume and unit price of imports and lower excise revenue resulting from low industrial growth.
11683,1999-2000,"Disinvestment receipts are expected to be Rs 8,000 crore against Rs 5,000 crore budgeted."
11684,1999-2000,The fiscal deficit is thus likely to increase to 6.5% of GDP from the budget target of 5.6% on the basis of comparable GDP estimates.
11685,1999-2000,"However, if the increase over budget in small savings loans to States and Union Territories is excluded, the adjusted fiscal deficit would be 5.9%."
11686,1999-2000,Budget Estimates for 19992000 4 9 .
11687,1999-2000,"In the budget estimates for 19992000, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 2,84,003 crore, of which Rs 77,000 crore is for Plan and Rs 2,07,003 crore for nonPlan."
11688,1999-2000,"The budget support for Central, State and UT Plans has been placed at Rs 77,000 crore, marking an increase of Rs 8,629 crore over revised estimates 199899."
11689,1999-2000,"Following the direction of the Prime Minister, the Plan for 19992000 focuses on basic human development needs such as education, health care, social welfare, housing, and water supply."
11690,1999-2000,"Thus, out of the total Gross Budgetary Support of Rs 44,000 crore for the Central Plan 19992000, Rs 31,035 crore has been provided to 18 Ministries/Departments covered by the Prime Minister’s Special Action Plan."
11691,1999-2000,"Total Central Plan outlay at Rs 1,03,521 crore will be more by Rs 15,039 crore from the last year’s level of Rs 88,482 crore."
11692,1999-2000,"Gross budgetary support for the Central Plan is being enhanced from Rs 38,263 crore in the revised estimates 199899 to Rs 44,000 crore."
11693,1999-2000,"Compared to revised estimates 19981999, outlay for Plan programmes has been significantly increased in certain priority sectors."
11694,1999-2000,"For example, the increase is 34.5% in the Agriculture and Allied Activities and 21.9% in Social Services."
11695,1999-2000,"Central Plan assistance to States and Union Territories in 19992000 is placed at Rs 33,000 crore as compared to Rs 30,108 crore in the revised estimates 199899."
11696,1999-2000,"Assistance for Basic Minimum Services and Slum Development Schemes is proposed to be enhanced from Rs 3,684 crore to Rs 4,043 crore."
11697,1999-2000,"Last year, I had announced a nonlapsable pool for the North East."
11698,1999-2000,I am glad to inform you that we have already released Rs 98 crore for projects in the North East out of the savings from the budget of different Central Ministries.
11699,1999-2000,Non Plan Expenditure 5 4 .
11700,1999-2000,"NonPlan expenditure in 19992000 is estimated to be Rs 2,07,003 crore compared to Rs 2,13,541 crore in revised estimates 199899."
11701,1999-2000,"This would have actually been Rs 2,32,003 crore but for a change in the system of accounting of loans to States and UTs against net Small Savings collections with effect from 1.4.99."
11702,1999-2000,"The changeover, which is in the interest of transparency and viability of the Small Savings schemes, is being made in deference to a suggestion in the Inter State Council in December 1998 on delinking the small savings from Central Government’s fiscal deficit concerns."
11703,1999-2000,A Committee set up under the chairmanship of Shri R.V. Gupta has gone into the issue.
11704,1999-2000,"Based on the Committee’s recommendations and with the concurrence of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India, the transactions will now be under a newly created National Small Savings Fund in the Public Account, which will reflect the Treasury Banking nature of these operations."
11705,1999-2000,A copy of the Committee’s report is being placed in the library of the Parliament for Hon’ble Members’ information.
11706,1999-2000,"Major items of increase in nonPlan expenditure are Interest payments, Rs 10,752 crore, Defence expenditure, Rs 4,494 crore, and grants to States, Rs 3,621 crore."
11707,1999-2000,"A provision of Rs 1,735 crore has been made for nonPlan loans to public sector enterprises mainly for payment of salaries and wages to the employees of sick and convalescent PSUs."
11708,1999-2000,"Rs 45,694 crore are being provided for Defence expenditure against Rs 41,200 crore in revised estimates 199899."
11709,1999-2000,Further need based budgetary support will be provided during the course of the year.
11710,1999-2000,"Before I proceed to detail my tax proposals, I would like to highlight the position of fiscal deficit in 19992000, if the existing rates of taxes and tariffs are continued."
11711,1999-2000,"Gross tax revenues would then be Rs 1,67,526 crore and the Centre’s net tax revenue would be Rs 1,22,730 crore."
11712,1999-2000,"Nontax revenues are estimated to increase from Rs 48,128 crore in revised estimates 199899 to Rs 50,475 crore this year."
11713,1999-2000,"The net revenue receipts for the Centre, including nontax receipts, would increase from Rs 1,57,664 crore in revised estimates 199899 to Rs 1,73,205 crore in 19992000."
11714,1999-2000,"After taking into account receipts of Rs 10,000 crore from disinvestment of equity in public sector enterprises, the fiscal deficit would be Rs 89,713 crore."
11715,1999-2000,I shall now come to my proposals to reduce the deficit.
11716,1999-2000,"I will start with indirect taxes, with excise first."
11717,1999-2000,"The multiple rates of indirect tax are generally recognised to be a major source of misclassification, tax evasion and avoidance and cumbersome litigation."
11718,1999-2000,The multiplicity also encourages inefficient allocation of resources.
11719,1999-2000,Over a 100 countries in the world now enjoy the benefits of a Value Added Tax VAT with very small number of rates in each case.
11720,1999-2000,"In my last Budget, I had clearly stated my resolve to rationalise the rate structure so as to reduce the multiplicity of rates and ensure convergence towards a central rate with a merit rate and a demerit rate."
11721,1999-2000,Most of our major industry associations have also called for a triple rate excise structure.
11722,1999-2000,My excise proposals today largely fulfil my intent announced 9 months ago.
11723,1999-2000,"Specifically, I propose to reduce the existing 11 major ad valorem rates to 3, namely, a central rate of 16%, a merit rate of 8% and a demerit rate of 24%."
11724,1999-2000,"To achieve this, I propose to: * Merge the existing rates of 5%, 10% and 12% into the existing 8% rate; * Create a new rate of 16% by merging the existing 13%, 15% and 18% rates into it; and *"
11725,1999-2000,Fix a new rate of 24% in substitution of the existing rate of 25%.
11726,1999-2000,Honourable Members may notice that I have reduced the previously announced central rate of 18% to 16%.
11727,1999-2000,This means lower costs and prices.
11728,1999-2000,"There is also a happy coincidence that this rate is almost identical to the rate of onesixth Shadbhaga advised by Kautilya, the noble sage of Pataliputra, which also happens to be my birthplace."
11729,1999-2000,"Considerations of revenue in this difficult year, however, persuade me to fix 2 slabs of surcharge special duty of excise of 6% and 16% over the rate of 24% on commodities which today carry a rate of duty of 30% and 40%."
11730,1999-2000,Thus total excise on these commodities will remain unchanged.
11731,1999-2000,Petrol will continue to be taxed at 32%.
11732,1999-2000,The surcharge structure gives a clear indication that in future the Government would gradually phase them down to the demerit rate of 24%.
11733,1999-2000,"As a result of these changes the excise rates for many commodities will either come down, or remain unchanged or be adjusted marginally upwards by a 1% point."
11734,1999-2000,"In the one major area of machinery and capital goods where the basic rate is rising from 13% to 16%, I must point out that excise on such products are eligible for MODVAT credit in the hands of the buyer."
11735,1999-2000,"Furthermore, to help the capital goods sector, my customs duty proposals include removal of the long standing anomaly by which the duty rate on the major input, steel, is higher than the duty rate on finished capital goods."
11736,1999-2000,I must also emphasise that this major reform of the excise rate structure is broadly revenue neutral.
11737,1999-2000,It does not impose additional tax burden on industry as a whole.
11738,1999-2000,"I am confident this major reform will stimulate productivity, growth and employment."
11739,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now move on to my next proposal."
11740,1999-2000,I propose to garner additional revenue by way of an additional duty on High Speed Diesel Oil HSD.
11741,1999-2000,"Currently, international and domestic prices of crude oil and petroleum products are unusually soft, and it is felt that raising some additional revenue through this commodity would be an equitable method of resource mobilisation."
11742,1999-2000,"Therefore, I propose an additional duty of Re. 1 per litre on imported and domestic HSD, the revenue from which will accrue entirely to the Centre."
11743,1999-2000,"Of this duty, I propose to allocate half to support the initiatives in rural development and social sectors."
11744,1999-2000,The other portion of 50 paise of this duty as also the duty of Re.1 per litre levied with effect from 2.6.1998 will be converted into a statutory cess and transferred to the Central Road Fund.
11745,1999-2000,The balance amount will be utilised for development and maintenance of National highways and expressways and by the Ministry of Railways for construction of Railways overbridges and Railways safety works at unmanned Railways crossings.
11746,1999-2000,This will cover the gap in the plan resources of the Ministry of Railways for the year 19992000.
11747,1999-2000,"It is estimated that we will be able to collect an aggregate amount of Rs 4,591 crore as additional duty of excise and Rs 363 crore as countervailing duty on domestically produced and imported HSD over the year."
11748,1999-2000,The Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas will announce consequential changes in the price of HSD effective from midnight tonight.
11749,1999-2000,"This will also fulfil in a large measure the will of Parliament reflected in Resolution dated 13th May, 1988, which contemplated earmarking a portion of the excise and customs duties on petrol and diesel to raise resources for development of roads."
11750,1999-2000,In the last budget the MODVAT adjustment allowed to manufacturing units had been capped at 95%.
11751,1999-2000,I propose to lift this cap on MODVAT claims and restore it to 100%.
11752,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, my budget proposals also contain a package for the Small Scale Industry SSI sector consisting of the following components: *"
11753,1999-2000,"Under the specific excise duty concession schemes for units manufacturing cosmetics, refrigeration and airconditioning equipment, I propose doubling of the turnover under the eligibility criteria from Rs 50 lakh to Rs 100 lakh; doubling of the duty free exemption slab from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 30 lakh; and, an increase from Rs 15 lakh to Rs 20 lakh in the clearances eligible for duty at half the normal rates."
11754,1999-2000,I propose to extend the benefit of the SSI exemption limits to smallscale units producing cotton yarn.
11755,1999-2000,I propose to exempt small job workers engaged in printing of glazed tiles from the incidence of excise duty.
11756,1999-2000,"Currently, SSI units are not eligible for exemption from excise duty on products bearing the brand name of another manufacturer."
11757,1999-2000,"I propose to extend the SSI exemption to goods bearing a brand name of another manufacturer, when produced by units located in the rural areas."
11758,1999-2000,The details of the scheme will be announced shortly.
11759,1999-2000,"Under the current procedure, all manufacturing units are required to pay excise duty at the time of clearance of goods from their manufacturing premises."
11760,1999-2000,"As 18 a measure of further simplification of administrative procedures, I propose to permit SSI units to pay excise duty on a monthly basis with effect from 1.6.1999."
11761,1999-2000,"Besides constituting a significant step in the simplification of procedures, this change will also improve the liquidity position of manufacturing units in the SSI Sector."
11762,1999-2000,I am proposing a similar procedural relaxation in respect of the requirement of maintenance of excise records by factories.
11763,1999-2000,"Henceforth, factories paying more than Rs 5 crore excise duty in a year, will not be required to maintain their records in a specific format prescribed by the excise department; and, the records maintained in the normal course of their functioning would be accepted as adequate."
11764,1999-2000,This amendment will take effect from 1.6.99.
11765,1999-2000,"Currently, there are several commodities, which are enjoying either total exemption from excise duty or are enjoying concessional excise duty."
11766,1999-2000,These concessions were sanctioned in the past with reference to the specific circumstances relating to that commodity prevailing at that point of time.
11767,1999-2000,"With the lowering of general rate of duties, the need for such exemptions and concessions has abated."
11768,1999-2000,I propose to set up an Expert Committee to examine and advise on where the exemptions should be retained and where they should be integrated into the new rate structure.
11769,1999-2000,Their report should be available for consideration before the next budget.
11770,1999-2000,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, Government is empowered to grant exemptions from excise duty on an adhoc basis."
11771,1999-2000,I do not consider such wide discretion necessary.
11772,1999-2000,"Hence, I propose to abolish Government’s power to grant adhoc exemptions of excise duty except for goods of strategic nature, or for charitable purposes."
11773,1999-2000,I propose abolition of similar powers on the customs duty side also.
11774,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to my proposals relating to customs duties."
11775,1999-2000,My proposals here reflect a balance of differing considerations.
11776,1999-2000,"On the one hand, we are committed to a calibrated integration of our economy with the world economy."
11777,1999-2000,This would entail further phasing down of our customs duties to Asian levels.
11778,1999-2000,"On the other hand, is the need to raise revenue and the fact that in a year of exceptional turbulence and uncertainty in the world economy, our industry should be cushioned against unusual surges of competitive pressure from imports."
11779,1999-2000,"Sir, a special customs duty of 2% was imposed in the budget of 199697, and a further special customs duty of 3% was imposed on certain items in 199798."
11780,1999-2000,The special customs duty of 5% is in force till 31.3.1999.
11781,1999-2000,I have in the course of another discussion assured this House that the period of validity of this special customs duty will not be extended.
11782,1999-2000,I announce the discontinuance of the 5% special customs duty with effect from 28.2.1999.
11783,1999-2000,"After careful examination of various possibilities, and close interaction with the apex organisations of Commerce and Industry, I propose to reduce the existing 7 major advalorem rates of customs duty to 5 basic rates."
11784,1999-2000,The new rates will be:  5%  which will remain unchanged;  15% by substituting the existing 10% rate;  25% by merging the 20% and 25% rates; 19  35% by merging the 30% and 35% rates;  40%  which will remain unchanged.
11785,1999-2000,The one industry in which a special regime of customs duty will apply is the Information Technology sector.
11786,1999-2000,The Prime Minister has repeatedly emphasised the importance of this sector for the country’s development in the new century and millennium.
11787,1999-2000,"Accordingly, I am proposing significant reduction in duty rates of a number of critical inputs in this sector, such as ICs and micro assemblies, storage devices and CD Roms, telecom equipment and optical fibres."
11788,1999-2000,"To garner revenue to meet the country’s irreducible needs, I propose a uniform surcharge of 10% on all commodities, excluding the following categories:  Crude Oil and Petroleum Products;  "
11789,1999-2000,Items attracting 40% rate of basic duty;  Certain GATT bound items;  Gold and Silver; The effect of the surcharge would be to raise the basic rate by 10%.
11790,1999-2000,"Thus a basic rate of 5% would become 5.5%, 15% would become 16.5% and so on."
11791,1999-2000,"Taking into account that special customs duty is being discontinued, and that crude oil and petroleum products are exempt from surcharge, the effective import duty rates on these products will stand reduced."
11792,1999-2000,This is consistent with the Government’s established policy of rationalising indirect taxes on these products in an agreed timeframe.
11793,1999-2000,"By exempting items attracting 40% rate of basic duty from the surcharge, there is a modest but clear reduction in the peak rate of protective custom duty from 45% to 40%."
11794,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, conceptually, I am averse to zero custom duty, since our domestic industry generally merits some minimal protection."
11795,1999-2000,I have reviewed the entire list of such commodities and to begin with I am proposing the imposition of 5% rate of duty for some of these commodities.
11796,1999-2000,"In order to mitigate the impact of the incidence of 5% rate of duty on such items which have previously enjoyed exemption, I propose to exempt this category from the existing 4% special additional duty."
11797,1999-2000,I am rationalising the import duty structure of project imports.
11798,1999-2000,"Under this rationalisation, power generation, coal mining, refinery, telecom and fertilizer projects will now attract a nominal basic customs duty of only 5%."
11799,1999-2000,"However, they will be subject to applicable rates of countervailing duty."
11800,1999-2000,The net impact of these changes will not be significant in most cases.
11801,1999-2000,Mega Power Projects also will be an exception to this.
11802,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of the various proposals made in this budget on the indirect taxes, the estimated revenue in 19992000 would be Rs 1,17,625 crore, including a component of net additional resource mobilisation of Rs 6,234 crore."
11803,1999-2000,"Last year, I had announced the setting up of an Authority for Advance Rulings for Excise and Customs."
11804,1999-2000,The necessary legislation has been included in this Finance Bill.
11805,1999-2000,"Drawn on the lines of the Advance Rulings Authority on the Direct Taxes, the proposed Authority would provide binding rulings on important issues, so that intending investors will have a clearcut indication of their duty liability in advance."
11806,1999-2000,The Central Board of Excise & Customs has adopted a “Vision Document” and the “Citizens Charter” which together present a blue print for the future and the service standards that can be expected of the Customs and Excise Department.
11807,1999-2000,The compliance of the service standards set out in the Charter is being closely monitored.
11808,1999-2000,The Commissioners of Customs and field level officers have been directed to enhance the quality of their service and have also been told that any noncompliance would be viewed adversely.
11809,1999-2000,"On the central excise side, the computerisation of assessment and audit operations is being given focussed attention, and before long, electronic filing of returns is proposed to be put into operation."
11810,1999-2000,Copies of the notifications giving effect to proposed changes in customs and excise duties will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
11811,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the proposals on the direct tax side."
11812,1999-2000,With growing liberalisation of the economy has come the need for industrial restructuring so that companies can focus better on their core activities.
11813,1999-2000,The corporate sector has been voicing the need for a flexible fiscal policy for regulating business re organisations.
11814,1999-2000,"In response to this need, I propose a comprehensive set of amendments to the Income Tax Act to make such business reorganisations fully tax neutral."
11815,1999-2000,"In the case of amalgamation of companies, the existing requirement of routing the proposal through Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction is being removed."
11816,1999-2000,"The legal provision is proposed to be amended so that the eligibility for tax concessions is only contingent upon a minimum of 75% of the fixed assets of the amalgamating company being absorbed in the amalgamated company, and subject to the condition that the amalgamated company will continue the business of the amalgamating company for a minimum of 5 years."
11817,1999-2000,"An enabling provision will be provided through the amendment of the IncomeTax Act, for the detailed guidelines to be issued subsequently under the powers available from the statutory provision."
11818,1999-2000,"In the case of demergers, I propose to introduce a legal provision so as to permit the carry forward of accumulated losses and unabsorbed depreciation from the demerging company to the resultant company."
11819,1999-2000,"I also propose to amend the legal provisions so that, neither the companies involved, nor the shareholders, are subject to capital gains tax as a result of the transactions."
11820,1999-2000,"Further, it is proposed that all fiscal concessions will survive for the unexpired period in the case of amalgamation and demergers 8 8 ."
11821,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, Government has been greatly concerned about the persisting sluggishness in the capital markets."
11822,1999-2000,Government is also distressed to note the negative perception of some sections of the investing public in regard to the 21 schemes operated by the Unit Trust of India.
11823,1999-2000,"Based on the recommendations of the Committee headed by Shri Deepak Parekh, and also taking into account a large number of suggestions offered by various experts in the field, I now propose a substantial fiscal package to restore the confidence of the shareholders in the UTI, and more generally to invigorate the capital markets."
11824,1999-2000,"First, I propose to fully exempt from income tax all income from UTI and other Mutual Funds received in the hands of the investors."
11825,1999-2000,"This will not only reduce the incidence of tax, but will eliminate the inconvenience faced by small investors in paying tax and claiming refund in connection with income derived from such investments."
11826,1999-2000,"Presently if the income in the hands of the investors is fully exempt from tax, this income is subjected to dividend tax under Section 115 O of the Income Tax Act, at the stage of distribution of the dividend by UTI or mutual funds."
11827,1999-2000,"As a departure from the policy, and as the second element of the package, I propose to continue for 3 years the exemption for US64, Scheme as also for all openended equityoriented schemes of UTI and mutual funds  with more than 50% investment in equity  from dividend tax."
11828,1999-2000,"However, income distributed by Mutual Funds, where the equity investment is less than 50%, will become subject to the 10% dividend tax."
11829,1999-2000,"As a result of these two tax initiatives, investments in UTI and other Mutual Funds will become much more attractive and equityoriented schemes will be relatively more attractive than schemes where equity investment is less than 50%."
11830,1999-2000,This should encourage the return of small investor to the capital market and revive confidence.
11831,1999-2000,A complaint has often been voiced that there is discrimination between the rate of longterm capital gains tax on transfer of shares and securities as between residents and nonresidents.
11832,1999-2000,"The current rate of longterm capital gains tax for resident Indians is 20% linked to a notional value of capital gains, computed with reference to a Cost of Inflation Index."
11833,1999-2000,"However, the rate of longterm capital gains tax for non residents is only 10%."
11834,1999-2000,"In response to this complaint, I now propose to amend the law so as to cap the longterm capital gains tax for resident Indians on transfer of shares and securities, at the 10% rate."
11835,1999-2000,"In some of the ‘sunrise’ sectors of the economy, the management is adopting a policy of offering stock options and Sweat Equity, to their employees."
11836,1999-2000,The tax implications of such transactions are somewhat ambiguous.
11837,1999-2000,"Therefore, I propose in this budget to make certain amendments in the law, to put it beyond doubt that such stock options will be taxed as a perquisite at the time of exercise of the option by the employee, and later as capital gains at the time of sale of the security."
11838,1999-2000,"These amendments, I expect, will remove the grey areas which exist in the current law relating to such transactions."
11839,1999-2000,"For boosting hightech sectors and supporting first generation entrepreneurs, there is an acute need for higher investment in venture capital activities."
11840,1999-2000,Very recently we have relaxed the guidelines under the existing scheme by removing the requirement for timebound investment and minimum lockinperiod of funds.
11841,1999-2000,"I am also harmonising the guidelines for registration of venture capital activity with the Central Board of Direct Taxes, with those for registration with the 22 Security and Exchange Board of India."
11842,1999-2000,This will ensure uniformity in norms for registration with both the organisations.
11843,1999-2000,"I am confident that these initiatives will increase the attractiveness of the Venture Capital Scheme and induce high net worth investors to commit their funds to the ‘sunrise’ sectors, particularly, the Information Technology Sector."
11844,1999-2000,"Very recently, the Companies Act, 1956 has been amended to permit transactions relating to buy back of shares."
11845,1999-2000,There is some ambiguity in the interpretation of the law as to whether such transactions would be treated as subject to dividend tax in addition to capital gains tax.
11846,1999-2000,"In view of this, I propose to amend the law to put it beyond doubt that on buyback of shares, the shareholders will not be subject to dividend tax, and would only be liable to capital gains tax."
11847,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to now turn to another area of special focus in this budget, namely the Housing Sector."
11848,1999-2000,"In regard to this sector, I propose a comprehensive package of fiscal incentives focussed at: * the middle class investors wishing to purchase a dwelling unit; * the promoters of middle income housing projects; and * the housing finance companies."
11849,1999-2000,"As the first element of this package, I propose that the interest on a loan for a selfoccupied property be exempted from tax up to a ceiling of Rs 75,000, increased from the current ceiling of Rs 30,000."
11850,1999-2000,This concession will encourage middle class investors to take loans to purchase modest dwelling units of their own.
11851,1999-2000,The second element of this incentive package relates to the scheme for housing projects for enjoying a tax holiday under Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act.
11852,1999-2000,"The existing provision, interalia, requires that the built up area of dwelling units should not exceed 1000 sq. feet."
11853,1999-2000,"There have been many representations that in towns other than Mumbai and Delhi, the land cost is relatively less, and therefore, for the same capital expenditure investors can afford to purchase dwelling units of slightly larger areas."
11854,1999-2000,"In view of this, it has been represented that the ceiling on built up areas for dwelling units in approved projects be increased from 1000 sq. ft"
11855,1999-2000,I propose to accept this suggestion and make suitable modifications in the law.
11856,1999-2000,"This amendment in the scheme for treating housing projects as infrastructure will, I believe, also give a significant fillip to construction activities in the smaller towns."
11857,1999-2000,"For the construction activity to pick up any significant degree of momentum, it has to be ensured that housing finance companies stay financially viable."
11858,1999-2000,"Currently, such housing finance companies are subject to tax on interest on loans, on accrual basis."
11859,1999-2000,"In order to lessen the burden on such housing finance companies, I propose to amend the law so that the income of such companies will be taxable on actual basis, rather than accrual basis."
11860,1999-2000,A significant number of individuals seeking accommodation in the major cities are the employees of the business sector.
11861,1999-2000,I feel that it is necessary to encourage the business sector to invest in housing for their employees so as to add to the net housing stock.
11862,1999-2000,"In this spirit, I propose to increase the depreciation rate from 20% to 40% on new dwelling units purchased by the business sector for its employees."
11863,1999-2000,"This entire package of fiscal incentives for the housing construction sector will, I believe, be a powerful force for revival of the entire economy."
11864,1999-2000,"The construction sector has very strong linkages with several other major sectors, notably steel and cement."
11865,1999-2000,"A general upsurge in construction activities will not only increase the corpus of housing stock in the country, but will give a substantial fillip to industrial activity."
11866,1999-2000,Apprehensions have been expressed in certain quarters regarding the incidence of a high level of Non Performing Assets NPAs in some of the banks.
11867,1999-2000,"I am of the view that the banks should make every effort to clean up their books and to remove any misgivings, which may exist about the transparency of the accounts."
11868,1999-2000,"To assist in this direction, Mr. Speaker, Sir, I propose to make tax deductible such amounts as are provided by banks as ‘doubtful debts’ subject to a maximum of 5% of the such aggregate ‘doubtful debts’, in any one year."
11869,1999-2000,This concession will be available for a period of 5 years for such ‘doubtful debts’ as are identified under the prudential norms prescribed by the Reserve Bank of India.
11870,1999-2000,I propose to amend the law so that tax concession will be available to a loanee on interest payment to a cooperative bank on actual basis rather than accrual basis.
11871,1999-2000,"This proposal will induce the loanees to make timely repayment of their interest liability in order to avail of the tax benefit, and correspondingly, the financial condition of the cooperative banks can be expected to improve."
11872,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the proposals relating to the Infrastructure and Industry sectors."
11873,1999-2000,"I propose to extend the fiscal incentives by way of the tax holiday under Section 80 IA of the Income Tax Act, to cold chains for agricultural produce."
11874,1999-2000,The financial condition of most of State Electricity Boards is extremely precarious.
11875,1999-2000,"Many of the State Electricity Boards wish to remedy the situation by unbundling generation, transmission and distribution activities to separate companies."
11876,1999-2000,"I propose to treat the activities of transmission and distribution of power, set up after 1.4.1999, as eligible activities for fiscal incentives available to infrastructure units."
11877,1999-2000,I am sanguine that this proposal will facilitate the restructuring and rehabilitation of the State Electricity Boards.
11878,1999-2000,"Currently, the tax exemption given under Section 80 IA of the Income Tax Act to the infrastructure sector and other core sectors, has to be availed of within a given maximum period."
11879,1999-2000,This given maximum period has come to vary from sector to sector.
11880,1999-2000,"In order to bring about uniformity, I propose the amendment of the Income Tax Act so as to provide a maximum period of 15 years in which units can avail of the tax concessions offered to infrastructure and other core sector units."
11881,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am conscious of the fact that, despite all our announcements, the industrial development in North Eastern Region has not come up to our expectations."
11882,1999-2000,"To give industrialisation a fillip in this area of the country, I propose a 10 year tax holiday for all industries set up in Growth Centres, Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporations, and for other specified industries, in the North Eastern Region."
11883,1999-2000,"I would urge the industrial entrepreneurs from this part of the country to seize the 24 opportunity and set up modern, high value added manufacturing units in the region."
11884,1999-2000,"The Indian entertainment industry, which includes films, music and television software is growing by leaps and bounds."
11885,1999-2000,"I believe that with our creativity and our talent, India has the potential to become a global media superpower."
11886,1999-2000,"We have done remarkably well in the field of computer software development and exports, and the same can be achieved in the development and export entertainment industry products, specially films, TV, software and music."
11887,1999-2000,"With a view to facilitating India becoming a super power in this sector, I am including a number of measures in the budget."
11888,1999-2000,My aim is to give similar facilities and tax benefits to this sector as are available to the export of goods and merchandise under section 80HHC.
11889,1999-2000,"Let me assure you that it would be our endeavour to support the entertainment industry “Dil Se”, and I am sure that no longer would the industry have to ask the government “Hum Apke Hain Kaun”?"
11890,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, we are all conscious of the fact that the Information Technology sector is going to be the sector of the future."
11891,1999-2000,"The immediate crisis, which is looming over this sector, is connected with the Y2K Problem, which will hit us at the close of the current calendar year."
11892,1999-2000,I get the impression that the corporate sector is not adequately seized of the dangers which lie ahead on account of this problem.
11893,1999-2000,"In these circumstances, to assist the business sector to overcome the Y2K Problem, I propose that all expenditure incurred in making their systems Y2K compliant be allowed as revenue expenditure in the next financial year."
11894,1999-2000,"I urge the business sector to avail of this concession and make every effort to remedy the defect in their software systems, so that their valuable databases do not spin into chaos."
11895,1999-2000,"Under the current law, a weighted deduction of 125% of the expenditure made on inhouse R&D is available to corporate houses up to 31.3.2000."
11896,1999-2000,Representations have been received that this period is too short for any company to plan its R&D programme.
11897,1999-2000,I propose to extend the concession for inhouse R&D up to 31.3.2005.
11898,1999-2000,"Further, I propose to extend a similar concession of permitting a weighted deduction of 125% of expenditure for R&D Projects entrusted to research laboratories and universities."
11899,1999-2000,"In the globalised economy, the future is for those who are in the vanguard of development of technology."
11900,1999-2000,"In view of this, I would urge the corporate sector to avail of this facility to the fullest extent."
11901,1999-2000,"In the last few years, the direct tax department has undertaken a concerted drive to extend the national tax base."
11902,1999-2000,"As a method of identifying potential taxpayers, the “One by Six” scheme was extended to 35 cities in 199899."
11903,1999-2000,This Scheme has given very satisfying results.
11904,1999-2000,"Consequent upon the launching of this scheme, the number of tax assessees has risen from 120 lakh to 140 lakh in the period of one year."
11905,1999-2000,It is the assessment of the department that there is considerable scope for further registration of tax assessees.
11906,1999-2000,"In view of the favourable results of the scheme, I now propose to extend this scheme to 19 more cities in the country having a population of more than 5 lakh."
11907,1999-2000,"Since the last budget, the Income Tax department has undertaken a drive for issue of PAN Numbers to the taxpaying applicants."
11908,1999-2000,"The response of this scheme 25 has been overwhelming, and we have received as many as 168 lakh applications."
11909,1999-2000,The requisite PAN Numbers have already been issued to 75 lakh taxpayers and we are confident that the remaining applications will be disposed in the next few months.
11910,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now like to highlight the proposals which are targeted at those sections of society which require Government’s special attention."
11911,1999-2000,"First, I propose that the deduction for medical insurance premia for senior citizens be raised from the current level of Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000 and tax deduction for treatment of specific diseases be increased to Rs 60,000."
11912,1999-2000,"Considering the fact that medical and hospitalisation costs have risen and life expectancy has also improved, the general insurance industry intends to increase the upper ceiling of the sum insured under the mediclaim policy from the existing level of Rs 3 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, and the upper age limit for coverage to 80 years from the existing 75 years."
11913,1999-2000,"Second, I propose that expenditure made in respect of hostel projects for working women be eligible for deduction from taxable income under Section 35AC of the IncomeTax Act."
11914,1999-2000,"Third, I propose that pension received by the recipients of the different gallantry award winners, and the family pension received by their heirs, be exempted from income tax."
11915,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I now submit my last proposal on direct taxes."
11916,1999-2000,"I face the difficult task of containing the revenue and fiscal deficits on the one hand, and on the other meeting the growing development expenditure."
11917,1999-2000,I propose to fulfil this task and also ensure equitable burden sharing.
11918,1999-2000,I am making a modest demand only on those sections of our society who have the capacity to pay while exempting low income earners.
11919,1999-2000,"With these considerations, I propose to impose an acrosstheboard surcharge of 10% on Corporate Tax, and also a 10% surcharge on all other categories of assessees."
11920,1999-2000,"In respect of individuals and Hindu Undivided Families, the applicability of the surcharge is limited to those having total income of Rs 60,000 or more."
11921,1999-2000,"In effect, this surcharge will mean an increase of a marginal 2% in the 20% slab & 3% in the 30% slab."
11922,1999-2000,It would leave the rate in the 10% slab unchanged.
11923,1999-2000,This is in the nature of a temporary surcharge.
11924,1999-2000,I trust that the House and our citizens will appreciate the circumstances in which I have had to make this proposal.
11925,1999-2000,"To sum up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of the various proposals made in this budget on the direct taxes, the estimated revenue in 19992000 would be Rs 59,235 crore, including a component of net additional resource mobilisation of Rs 3,100 crore."
11926,1999-2000,"I now have something to say on behalf of my colleague, the Minister of Communications."
11927,1999-2000,Postal Service is highly employment intensive and salary & allowances constitute a major part of the operating expenses of the Postal Department.
11928,1999-2000,"A revision of tariff for some postal services has, therefore, become unavoidable."
11929,1999-2000,"However, in the interest of the common man and the role of the postal services in easy dissemination of news and information there will be no change in the tariff for Postcard, Money orders, Book packets containing printed books and Registered newspapers."
11930,1999-2000,"However, the rate of Printed Postcard is being raised from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.00, of Competition Postcard from Rs 3.00 to Rs 4.00, of Inland letter from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.00, of Book pattern and sample packets from Re.1.00 to Rs 2.00 for first 50 grams or part thereof and from Rs 2.00 to Rs 3.00 for every additional 50 grams or 26 part thereof, and Parcels from Rs 10.00 to Rs 12.00 for a weight not exceeding 500 grams or part thereof and from Rs 10.00 to Rs 15.00 for every additional 500 grams or part thereof."
11931,1999-2000,"There are also certain other changes, which are explained in the Memorandum circulated along with the budget documents."
11932,1999-2000,The changes would take effect from a date to be notified after the Finance Bill is passed.
11933,1999-2000,The revisions proposed are estimated to yield additional revenue of about Rs 145 crore in a full year and about Rs 121 crore during 19992000.
11934,1999-2000,"Even this modest increase which is necessary for sustaining postal development, will only partially meet the cost of various services."
11935,1999-2000,"As a result of the postal tariff revision, total expenditure of the Central Government for the year 19992000 would be marginally reduced to Rs 2,83,882 crore while with my tax and other proposals, net revenue receipts and nondebt capital receipts would increase to Rs 2,03,927 crore."
11936,1999-2000,"The revenue deficit is placed at Rs 54,147 crore, while the fiscal deficit is placed at Rs 79,955 crore."
11937,1999-2000,This amounts to 2.7% and 4.0% respectively on the basis of the new series of GDP announced by Central Statistical Organisation and after excluding the payment of the share of small savings collection to State Governments.
11938,1999-2000,"Based on the old series of GDP and excluding the payment of the share of small savings collection to State Governments, the percentage works out to 3.0% and 4.4% respectively."
11939,1999-2000,"With the Budget for 19992000, we will have set in motion a mediumterm strategy for restoring the fiscal health of our economy."
11940,1999-2000,"This budget proposes to reduce the revenue and fiscal deficits by 0.7% and 0.6% of GDP, respectively."
11941,1999-2000,"At this rate of reduction, the revenue deficit will be eliminated in 4 years and the fiscal deficit will have declined below 2% of GDP."
11942,1999-2000,The budget proposes major reform of our excise taxes.
11943,1999-2000,In the mediumterm we will move to a single rate and a fullfledged VAT system.
11944,1999-2000,Our customs duty structure will be phased down to Asian levels in 5 years.
11945,1999-2000,During this period Indian industry will have restructured and become fully competitive in world markets.
11946,1999-2000,Our knowledgebased industries will generate lakhs of jobs.
11947,1999-2000,The gains from competition and productivity growth will drive our exports to new heights.
11948,1999-2000,Over the same period our physical and human infrastructure will be raised close to world class.
11949,1999-2000,"Above all, the basic needs of all our people for food, shelter, health, education and employment will be met within a decade from now."
11950,1999-2000,These achievements will transform India into a genuine economic super power by the year 2020.
11951,1999-2000,The twentyfirst century belongs to us.
11952,1999-2000,"In the words of the Prime Minister Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee  +ÉÉÄJÉÉå àÉå ́Éè£É ́É BÉEä oÉ{ÉxÉä,{ÉMÉ àÉå iÉÚ{ÉEÉxÉÉå BÉEÉÒ MÉÉÊiÉ cÉä, ®É]Å£ÉÉÎBÉDiÉ BÉEÉ V ́ÉÉ® xÉ âóBÉEiÉÉ, +ÉÉA ÉÊVÉoÉÉÊVÉoÉ"
11953,1999-2000,"BÉEÉÒ ÉÊcààÉiÉ cÉä** With dreams of prosperity and marching at a stormy pace, the tide of patriotism will not recede."
11954,1999-2000,Let the courageous come forward to join me.
11955,1999-2000,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to this august House."
11956,2000-01,I rise to present the first budget of this millennium.
11957,2000-01,This budget for 20002001 has some other firsts to its credit also.
11958,2000-01,It is the first budget of the new Government which took office in October 1999 under the visionary leadership of Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee.
11959,2000-01,It is also the first budget of the second half century of our Republic and the first budget of the new century.
11960,2000-01,I hope it will add many more firsts to its credit as time goes by.
11961,2000-01,I thank the Hon’ble Prime Minister for entrusting me with this historic responsibility which I stand here to discharge in all humility.
11962,2000-01,"The year 19992000 has been a year of many challenges: the 50 day war in Kashmir, the super cyclone in Orissa, long months of political uncertainty before the general elections, a somewhat weak monsoon, a near tripling of world oil prices and the continued fragility in world economic recovery."
11963,2000-01,"Nevertheless, we have met these challenges resolutely, accomplished a great deal and the nation is stronger as a result."
11964,2000-01,The economy’s performance is described in detail in the Economic Survey I laid before the House yesterday.
11965,2000-01,Let me just touch a few highlights.
11966,2000-01,A broadbased industrial recovery is under way.
11967,2000-01,"Despite lower growth of agriculture due to inclement weather, overall economic growth this year is expected to be nearly 6%."
11968,2000-01,The infrastructure sector is performing much better.
11969,2000-01,For the first time in 17 years the inflation rate has stayed below 4% for 42 consecutive weeks.
11970,2000-01,"Even more remarkable, the Consumer Price Index Industrial Workers in November 1999 showed zero increase over the previous November."
11971,2000-01,This is an enormous boon for the weakest sections of our society.
11972,2000-01,Public food stocks are at record levels.
11973,2000-01,"Exports have achieved a remarkable turn around from negative growth last year to nearly 13% growth in dollar terms in AprilDecember, 1999."
11974,2000-01,Our software exports are also booming.
11975,2000-01,"Although surging international oil prices have increased our oil import bill by more than $6 billion, our foreign exchange reserves have nevertheless attained new record levels."
11976,2000-01,With the return of investor confidence our stock markets have also soared to new heights.
11977,2000-01,In my last two budgets I have addressed the accumulated shortcomings in our policies and freed our companies to compete globally.
11978,2000-01,"We have strengthened our agricultural sector, energised our financial markets and laid the foundations of an exciting new economy."
11979,2000-01,"With this, my third budget, I propose to put India on a sustained, equitable and jobcreating growth path of 7 to 8% per year in order to banish the scourge of poverty from our land within a decade."
11980,2000-01,The next 10 years will be India’s decade of development.
11981,2000-01,"To achieve this objective our strategy must encompass the following elements: ♦ Strengthen the foundations of growth of our rural economy, especially agriculture and allied activities."
11982,2000-01,In all these areas we must pursue thoroughgoing economic reforms to unlock the creative energies of our people and thus reap the gains of productivity growth.
11983,2000-01,But our reforms must also be guided by compassion and justice.
11984,2000-01,In his Address to Parliament in October 1999 the President has set out the broad outlines of our programme of second generation reforms.
11985,2000-01,This budget carries forward the process of implementation.
11986,2000-01,"Today, we must squarely confront and overcome the critical challenge posed by a weakening fiscal situation."
11987,2000-01,A long history of high fiscal deficits has left us with a legacy of a huge public debt and an evergrowing bill of interest payments.
11988,2000-01,"This year we have incurred unanticipated expenditure on national defence, elections and the super cyclone in Orissa."
11989,2000-01,The residual impact of the Fifth Pay Commission and the need for special fiscal assistance to the States have added to our burden.
11990,2000-01,"All this, combined with shortfalls in receipts from disinvestment and revenue, has raised our net borrowing requirements our fiscal deficit to over Rs 1,00,000 crore."
11991,2000-01,"This will add about Rs 10,000 crore to our interest bill next year."
11992,2000-01,"We must also find additional resources for Plan, Defence and for additional transfers to States under the interim award of the Eleventh Finance Commission."
11993,2000-01,"If we do not raise the resources 3 and instead take recourse to even higher borrowing next year, then we will jeopardise our prospects for growth, reignite the flames of inflation, sow the seeds of another balance of payments crisis and place an unfair burden on the next generation."
11994,2000-01,We must put our fiscal house in order.
11995,2000-01,This means hard decisions and sacrifices.
11996,2000-01,"At the same time we must preserve the intrinsic dynamism of our economy, which alone can deliver sustained growth with social justice."
11997,2000-01,"For this reason, despite the severe fiscal strain, the budget support to the plan is being increased by Rs 11,100 crore to a level of Rs 88,100 crore compared to Rs 77,000 crore in B.E. 19992000."
11998,2000-01,"Similarly, there cannot be any compromise on Defence."
11999,2000-01,Our forces have once again demonstrated in Operation Vijay that they are second to none in the world.
12000,2000-01,Government is committed to enhance the quality of our defence preparedness and to modernise our forces.
12001,2000-01,"In this budget I have made a provision of Rs 58,587 crore for defence, which is nearly Rs 13,000 crore more than in B.E. for the current year."
12002,2000-01,This represents the largest ever increase in the defence budget in any single year.
12003,2000-01,More will be provided whenever needed.
12004,2000-01,We shall not shrink from making any sacrifice to guard and protect every inch of our beloved motherland.
12005,2000-01,"Over the years the composition of Central Government expenditure has become highly rigid and prone to large, precommitted increases."
12006,2000-01,More than half of the annual budget outlays are transfer payments.
12007,2000-01,"Interest payments, Defence, Internal Security, Major Subsidies, Salaries, Allowances and Pensions and nonplan grants to States account for about 95% of nonplan expenditure and about 70% of total expenditure."
12008,2000-01,"To curb builtin expenditure growth and bring about structural changes in the composition of our expenditure, I am introducing the following initiatives."
12009,2000-01,I had announced this initiative last year and I am glad that this exercise has been completed in 8 Departments.
12010,2000-01,As a result 69 schemes are to be discontinued or merged.
12011,2000-01,This process will be completed in a timebound manner in the remaining Departments.
12012,2000-01,The manpower requirements of Government departments will be reassessed by reviewing the norms for creation of posts.
12013,2000-01,A VRS scheme will also be introduced for staff in the surplus pool.
12014,2000-01,No new autonomous institutions will be created without approval of Cabinet.
12015,2000-01,Budgetary support to autonomous institutions will be reviewed and they will be encouraged to maximise generation of internal resources.
12016,2000-01,"In order to align with the overall interest rate structure, the interest rate on General Provident Funds is being reduced by 1% to 11% from 1.4.2000."
12017,2000-01,"To reduce expenditure on this account, a portion of the disinvestment proceeds will be earmarked for retiring Government debt."
12018,2000-01,"An initial provision of Rs 1,000 4 crore has been made in the budget for this purpose."
12019,2000-01,I will have something more to say on major subsidies a little later.
12020,2000-01,These measures are necessary and are only a beginning.
12021,2000-01,We shall pursue resolutely the objective of downsizing Government and prepare a roadmap for the purpose.
12022,2000-01,For mediumterm management of the fiscal deficit we also need the support of a strong institutional mechanism embodied in a Fiscal Responsibility Act.
12023,2000-01,This had been suggested in the Agenda for Governance of the National Democratic Alliance.
12024,2000-01,I have set up a committee to examine this issue and make suitable recommendations.
12025,2000-01,I hope to bring the necessary legislative proposals to the House during the course of the year.
12026,2000-01,The challenge of fiscal management is not confined to the Central Government.
12027,2000-01,The financial position of the State Governments has deteriorated sharply in the last few years.
12028,2000-01,Revenue deficits have widened and borrowings are being increasingly used to meet revenue expenditure.
12029,2000-01,Fiscal reform at the State level has acquired great urgency.
12030,2000-01,"While we have gone out of our way to help State Governments, the determination shown by some States to deal with these issues has also helped enormously."
12031,2000-01,It will be my endeavour to take further collective measures in the next year for promoting fiscal reforms in the States.
12032,2000-01,The final report of the Eleventh Finance Commission will provide valuable inputs for taking policy initiatives in this regard.
12033,2000-01,Agriculture and Rural Development 13.
12034,2000-01,"It is my firm belief that sustained and broadbased growth of agriculture is essential for alleviating poverty, generating incomes and employment, assuring food security and sustaining a buoyant domestic market for industry and services."
12035,2000-01,We must take all necessary measures to strengthen the rural economy.
12036,2000-01,"Credit flow to agriculture through institutional channels of commercial banks, cooperative banks and Regional Rural Banks is estimated at about Rs 41,800 crore this year."
12037,2000-01,"It is expected to increase by over 20 per cent to a level of Rs 51,500 crore in 20002001."
12038,2000-01,In my last two budgets we have launched a wide array of initiatives to promote the flow of rural credit.
12039,2000-01,In this budget I propose to strengthen the earlier programmes and launch further initiatives:
12040,2000-01,"Last year I had announced an enhanced allocation of Rs 3,500 crore from the banking sector for RIDF V and extended the repayment period of loans to 7 years."
12041,2000-01,"The scope of RIDF was also widened to allow lending to Gram Panchayats, Self Help Groups, NGOs and other eligible organisations for implementing village level infrastructure projects."
12042,2000-01,"This year the corpus of RIDF VI will be increased to Rs 4,500 crore and the interest charged on this lending will be reduced by half a percent."
12043,2000-01,"In my last budget I had asked NABARD and SIDBI to cover 50,000 Self Help Groups to develop micro enterprises."
12044,2000-01,"NABARD by itself is likely to link 50,000 such Groups to banks during the current year."
12045,2000-01,NABARD and SIDBI will cover an additional one lakh Groups during 2000 2001.
12046,2000-01,"To give a further boost to this programme a Micro Finance 5 Development Fund will be created in NABARD with a start up contribution of Rs 100 crore from RBI, NABARD, banks and others."
12047,2000-01,This Fund will provide start up funds to micro finance institutions and infrastructure support for training and systems management and data building.
12048,2000-01,"Special emphasis will be placed on promotion of micro enterprises in rural areas set up by vulnerable sections including women, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes."
12049,2000-01,"However, over time, problems have developed, mainly because of excessive bureaucratization and the overlapping jurisdiction of State Governments and NABARD."
12050,2000-01,Some State Governments have already taken legislative action to promote genuinely cooperative institutions.
12051,2000-01,"For rural credit, clear delineation of the supervisory role of RBI/NABARD on banking matters is also essential."
12052,2000-01,To promote these two prerequisites for a more vibrant rural cooperative credit system I propose to establish a Fund in NABARD.
12053,2000-01,The details will be worked out in the light of the forthcoming recommendations of the Capoor Committee earlier constituted by Government.
12054,2000-01,"In the meantime, RBI is advising the banks to accord priority to the credit needs of those cooperatives which are entirely controlled by usermembers and managed by them prudently."
12055,2000-01,The programme of Kisan Credit Cards is progressing very well.
12056,2000-01,"Cooperative Banks, Regional Rural Banks and Commercial Banks together have so far issued more than 50 lakh cards and cardcumpass books to the farmers."
12057,2000-01,I am asking NABARD and Commercial Banks to redouble their promotional efforts so as to issue an additional 75 lakh Kisan Credit Cards by March 2001.
12058,2000-01,"Out of these, 48 RRBs have been able to wipe out their accumulated losses."
12059,2000-01,"In view of the importance of the RRBs in rural financing, we will continue with this programme of strengthening the RRBs."
12060,2000-01,The Planning Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture have worked out modalities to integrate 28 ongoing separate Centrally Sponsored Schemes of agricultural development into one comprehensive programme.
12061,2000-01,"This will weed out duplication, enhance the productivity of the support programme and accord greater flexibility to State Governments to develop and pursue activities on the basis of regional priorities."
12062,2000-01,This is a major step forward towards the goals of convergence and decentralisation that I had outlined in my budget last year.
12063,2000-01,"There is urgent need to review and coordinate our longterm strategy at the National and the State levels on the pattern of land use in the country, development of agriculture in relation to the agroclimatic conditions in the different regions and preservation of our forest resources."
12064,2000-01,"We need to adopt an integrated approach to a number of related subjects such as preservation and development of the forest wealth, optimum utilisation of the wasteland, watershed development, safeguarding bio diversity etc."
12065,2000-01,"In view of the complexity of the issues involved, a National Commission on Land Use Policy comprising of experts in the relevant fields will be set up to 6 examine the various aspects and make appropriate recommendations to Government."

12073,2000-01,"Some new initiatives include a scheme for universalisation of elementary education called “Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan” which would enable all children to enroll by 2003 and expansion of the District Primary Education Programme to cover the remaining districts in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Orissa and Gujarat."
12074,2000-01,On the literacy front the National Literacy Mission would be revamped so that the literacy rate can be raised to 75% by the year 2005.
12075,2000-01,"The plan allocation for elementary education has been increased from Rs 2,931 crore to Rs 3,729 crore next year."
12076,2000-01,A new Department of Drinking Water Supply in the Ministry of Rural Development has been set up to intensify the efforts and accelerate the pace of coverage.

12086,2000-01,The concerned Ministries in the Central Government will lay down the guidelines and monitor the implementation of these programmes.
12087,2000-01,The erstwhile Basic Minimum Services Scheme will be merged with the new Scheme.

12102,2000-01,"Below poverty line participants in this Scheme will pay only half the premium, with the remainder being contributed from earnings of LIC’s existing Social Security Fund, suitably augmented by Government."
12103,2000-01,"On this basis, the monthly premium to be paid by the beneficiary is expected to be Rs 10 or less."
12104,2000-01,This scheme will lay a firm foundation for insurance cover to the poorest in our country.
12105,2000-01,There is an urgent need for improving the access of women to national resources and for ensuring their rightful place in the mainstream of economic development.
12106,2000-01,"Towards this objective, the Government will set up a Task Force under an eminent person to review all existing legislation and Government schemes pertaining to the role of women in the national economy."

12118,2000-01,"In the context of growing domestic and international competition, our strategy is to support this sector through promotional policies of credit and technology."
12119,2000-01,"For improving credit flow to SSI units, I propose the following: ♦ The requirement of providing collateral security is a major bottleneck to the flow of bank credit to very small units."
12120,2000-01,RBI has recently issued instructions to dispense with the collateral requirement for loans up to Rs 1 lakh.
12121,2000-01,The limit is being further increased for the tiny sector from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.
12122,2000-01,"To promote credit flow to small borrowers, the composite loan limit is being increased from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 10 lakh."
12123,2000-01,"Furthermore, to improve the quality of banking services, SSI branches are being asked to obtain ISO certification."
12124,2000-01,I am glad to inform the House that a new Central Scheme for this purpose has been formulated and a provision for Rs 100 crore has been made in the budget.
12125,2000-01,The Scheme will be implemented through SIDBI and will cover loans upto Rs 10 lakhs from the banking sector.
12126,2000-01,The guaranteed loans will be securitised and will be tradeable in the secondary debt market.
12127,2000-01,SIDBI operates the National Equity Fund Scheme under which equity support is provided for projects up to Rs 15 lakh.
12128,2000-01,"To further help SSI entrepreneurs, this limit will be raised from Rs 15 lakh to 25 lakh."
12129,2000-01,SIDBI is presently administering the Technology Development Modernisation Fund Scheme for assisting technology development and modernisation of SSI units.
12130,2000-01,The Scheme has certain concessional features including interest at prime lending rate for direct assistance and refinancing at 2% below prime rate for indirect finance.
12131,2000-01,The operation of this scheme is being extended by another 3 years.
12132,2000-01,The Khadi and Village Industries Commission KVIC has been playing a very important role as an instrument to generate large scale employment in the rural areas with low per capita investment.
12133,2000-01,Government will continue to encourage the Khadi and Village Industry Sector so that its products can become more competitive.
12134,2000-01,"For intensifying marketing efforts, the KVIC will introduce a common brand name for its products and also set up a professionally managed marketing company for domestic as well as export marketing."
12135,2000-01,Industry and Capital Market 31.
12136,2000-01,"In earlier millennia, India led the world on the basis of knowledge."
12137,2000-01,Today history is repeating itself.

12140,2000-01,Companies unknown 5 years ago have become world leaders.
12141,2000-01,We must do everything possible to promote this flowering of knowledgebased enterprise and job creation.
12142,2000-01,A key ingredient for future success lies in Venture Capital Finance.
12143,2000-01,"After a thorough review, I am proposing a major liberalisation of the tax treatment for venture capital funds."
12144,2000-01,I will describe the details later.
12145,2000-01,"To simplify the procedures, SEBI will be the single point nodal agency for registration and regulation of both domestic and overseas venture capital funds."
12146,2000-01,Venture activity is not limited to dot.com companies!
12147,2000-01,"Ideas and entrepreneurship, which merit venture finance, can be found in all sectors of the economy."
12148,2000-01,The tax laws and SEBI guidelines are being formulated accordingly.
12149,2000-01,"I should add that this liberalisation will give a strong boost for Non Resident Indians in Silicon Valley and elsewhere to invest some of their capital, knowledge and enterprise in ventures in their motherland."
12150,2000-01,"In recent months stock markets have been buoyant all over the world, including India."
12151,2000-01,Experience has taught us that there can be hard times as well.
12152,2000-01,It is in such difficult times that institutions like investor protection funds of stock exchanges become really important.
12153,2000-01,I will have something to say on this in part B of my speech.
12154,2000-01,"Thanks to our prudent macroeconomic management and calibrated approach to currency convertibility, we have successfully weathered the East Asian crisis of the past two years."
12155,2000-01,But we must not confuse caution with timidity.
12156,2000-01,"We must encourage Indian firms and businesses to grow into strong, Indiabased multinationals."
12157,2000-01,"To promote this trend, it is necessary to accord our firms increasing flexibility to undertake capital account transactions, especially for acquisitions of businesses abroad."
12158,2000-01,"Last month, Government had announced a policy to allow Indian companies to raise funds for investments through issue of ADRs GDRs without prior Government approval."
12159,2000-01,Up to 50% of these proceeds can be used by them to acquire companies in overseas market.
12160,2000-01,"We had also announced on 27th December, 1999, a liberalized mechanism for acquisition of software companies in the overseas market through stock swap options up to US$100 million on an automatic basis."
12161,2000-01,"I plan to further liberalize this policy for acquisition of companies abroad to enable Indian corporates, in knowledgebased sectors to grow rapidly and lay the foundation for Indian multinationals in areas where we have comparative economic advantage."
12162,2000-01,"For acquisition in other sectors too, I propose to increase the ceiling under the automatic route from existing US$15 million to US$50 million for Indian corporates and beyond this, through approval by the Committee on Overseas Investment."
12163,2000-01,"Under existing policy on portfolio investment, Foreign Institutional Investors FIIs are permitted to invest in a company, upto an aggregate of 24% of equity shares, which can be increased to 30% subject to approval by the Board of Directors and a Special Resolution of the General Body of the Company."
12164,2000-01,"To give our best companies greater access to foreign portfolio investment, I am increasing this limit from 30% to 40%."
12165,2000-01,Science and Technology 3 6 .
12166,2000-01,The sustained growth of our knowledgebased industries will ultimately depend on the quality and extent of scientific and technological progress and training in our society.
12167,2000-01,We must harness our potential in science and technology to realise the dream of modern India envisioned by the Prime Minister in his address to the Indian Science Congress last month.
12168,2000-01,"For taking up relevant technology vision projects and for increasing cooperation between our Universities and R&D institutions, I am making an additional provision of Rs 50 crore in the budget of the Technology Information Forecasting and Assessment Council under the Department of Science and Technology."
12169,2000-01,I am also making a provision of Rs 50 crore in the budget of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research for launching a New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership Initiative.

12171,2000-01,"To fully benefit from the new intellectual property rights regime, we need to encourage our scientists and R&D institutions to maximise their patenting efforts."
12172,2000-01,Government have decided to allow Universities and Research Institutions to retain the revenue generated from intellectual property rights through publicly funded research and also share a part of the revenue with the inventor.
12173,2000-01,Modernisation of the Patent Office and the Trade Mark Register is long overdue.
12174,2000-01,Government have sanctioned a modernisation project of Rs 75 crore for the Patent Office and we will strive to remove all impediments for early implementation of this project.
12175,2000-01,The recent East Asian crisis has underlined the critical importance of undertaking reforms to strengthen the banking sector.
12176,2000-01,"In recent years, RBI has been prescribing prudential norms for banks broadly consistent with international practice."
12177,2000-01,"To meet the minimum capital adequacy norms set by RBI and to enable the banks to expand their operations, public sector banks will need more capital."
12178,2000-01,"With the Government budget under severe strain, such capital has to be raised from the public which will result in reduction in Government shareholding."
12179,2000-01,"To facilitate this process, Government have decided to accept the recommendations of the Narasimham Committee on Banking Sector Reforms for reducing the requirement of minimum shareholding by Government in nationalised banks to 33%."
12180,2000-01,This will be done without changing the public sector character of banks and while ensuring that fresh issue of shares is widely held by the public.
12181,2000-01,"The Committee had also expressed the view that the Boards of the banks should have sufficient autonomy to take decisions on 11 corporate strategy and all aspects of business management and be responsible to the stakeholders, that is, the shareholders, the customers, the employees and the public at large."
12182,2000-01,"In particular, the interests of the employees of the nationalised Banks will be fully safeguarded."
12183,2000-01,It is proposed to bring about necessary changes in the legislative provisions to accord necessary flexibility and autonomy to the Boards of the banks.
12184,2000-01,"As Honourable Members are aware, the Report of the Working Group on Restructuring Weak Public Sector Banks had suggested the constitution of a Financial Restructuring Authority FRA."
12185,2000-01,It has been decided to have a modified version of the FRA.
12186,2000-01,"Thus, in respect of any bank which is considered to be weak or potentially weak, the statutes governing public sector banks would be amended to provide for supersession of the Board of Directors on the basis of recommendations of the RBI and constitution of a FRA for such a bank, comprising experts and professionals."
12187,2000-01,The amendments would also enable the FRA to exercise special powers including all the powers of the Board of the bank.
12188,2000-01,Government will not close down any public sector bank.
12189,2000-01,"As responsible owner of the banks, Government have decided to consider recapitalisation of the weak banks to achieve the prescribed capital adequacy norms, provided a viable restructuring programme acceptable to the Government as the owner and the RBI as the regulator is made available by the concerned banks."
12190,2000-01,The high level of NonPerforming Assets NPAs in our public sector banks is a cause for continued concern.
12191,2000-01,Efficient and effective mechanisms for recovery of bank dues are critically important for reducing NPAs.
12192,2000-01,"I am happy to inform the House that comprehensive amendments have been carried out to the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993 by issue of Ordinance."
12193,2000-01,Five more Debt Recovery Tribunals DRT and four more Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunals have been set up or are in advanced stage of being set up.
12194,2000-01,"I further propose to set up four more DRTs at Mumbai and one more DRT each at Calcutta, Delhi and Chennai to facilitate expeditious adjudication and recovery of dues of banks and financial institutions."
12195,2000-01,The growth of fresh NPAs can also be curbed through better institutional mechanisms for sharing of credit related information on borrowers and potential borrowers among banks and financial institutions.
12196,2000-01,A Working Group constituted by RBI to examine modalities for setting up a Credit Information Bureau has recently submitted its report.
12197,2000-01,Based on its recommendation a Credit Information Bureau will soon be established.
12198,2000-01,In the fast changing world of modern finance it has become necessary to accord greater operational flexibility to the RBI for conduct of monetary policy and regulation of the financial system.
12199,2000-01,"Accordingly, I intend to bring to Parliament proposals for amending the relevant legislation."
12200,2000-01,"Similarly, to facilitate development of the Government debt market the legislative framework needs to be strengthened and modernised through a Government Securities Act, which I propose to bring to replace the old Public Debt Act, 1944."
12201,2000-01,The Industrial Investment Bank of India is the only Calcuttabased 12 development financial institution.
12202,2000-01,"To enable it to improve its viability and profitability by diversifying and extending its business, Government will subscribe to the preference capital of the company."
12203,2000-01,NBFCs perform a significant role as financial intermediaries and in promoting growth of industry and services.
12204,2000-01,Over the past 3 years RBI has taken a number of measures for strengthening the regulation of this sector with a view to ensuring that only financially sound and well run NBFCs are permitted to accept public deposits.
12205,2000-01,I propose to bring a new bill which will strengthen the hands of depositors in situations of malafide or fraudulent actions of NBFCs.
12206,2000-01,Infrastructure services remain a key bottleneck to rapid and sustained growth of our economy.
12207,2000-01,We have made substantial progress in encouraging private infrastructure service providers and in establishing independent regulatory frameworks in most infrastructure sectors.
12208,2000-01,We have also sought to give greater operational and commercial autonomy to existing public entities in these sectors.
12209,2000-01,"We will be moving ahead with programmes for corporatisation of public sector service providers in the areas of telecommunications, ports and airports during the course of the coming year."
12210,2000-01,"The Prime Minister has announced a major initiative for road development, the National Highways Development Project NHDP."
12211,2000-01,"The cost of the project is estimated at around Rs 54,000 crore."
12212,2000-01,"In my earlier budgets, I had announced the levy of cess of one rupee per litre on petrol and diesel and a substantial part of this is expected to be available for funding the NHDP."
12213,2000-01,"To further augment resources, for commercially viable components of this project, I shall have something more to say in Part B of my speech."
12214,2000-01,"The plan outlay for the Central PSUs in the power sector has been increased from Rs 7,626 crore to Rs 9,194 crore."
12215,2000-01,Increased budgetary support has been provided for the Tehri Hydro and the Nathpa Jakhari Hydro projects so that both these projects can be commissioned by March 2002.

12219,2000-01,The State Electricity Boards have large overdues to the Central Sector Power and Coal utilities.
12220,2000-01,A Scheme for securitisation of these dues with the support of Central Government has been finalized to assist the SEBs to clear these dues.
12221,2000-01,Central Government support will be linked to reforms in the operation of SEBs.
12222,2000-01,Hon’ble members are aware that the Sethu Samudram Ship Canal Project has the potential of providing a shorter route between the East and West Coast 13 Ports.

12226,2000-01,Its main ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ 56.
12227,2000-01,There are many PSUs which are sick and not capable of being revived.
12228,2000-01,The only remaining option is to close down these undertakings after providing an acceptable safety net for the employees and workers.
12229,2000-01,Resources under the National Renewal Fund have not been sufficient to meet the cost of Voluntary Separation Scheme VSS for such PSUs.
12230,2000-01,"At the same time, these PSUs have assets, which if unbundled and realised, can be used for funding VSS."
12231,2000-01,Government will put in place mechanisms to raise resources from the market against the security of these assets and use these funds to provide an adequate safetynet to workers and employees.
12232,2000-01,"Government have recently established a new Department for Disinvestment to establish a systematic policy approach to disinvestment and privatisation and to give a fresh impetus to this programme, which will emphasize increasingly on strategic sales of identified PSUs."

12253,2000-01,This has been a difficult year for the budget marked by expenditure over runs and some deceleration in tax collection.
12254,2000-01,The increase in budgeted expenditure has been 7% whereas shortfall in budgeted tax collection is estimated to be 4%.
12255,2000-01,"The nonplan expenditure has increased by Rs 17,461 crore 8.4% over budget estimate of Rs 2,06,882 crore and the plan expenditure by Rs 2,395 crore 3.1% over budget estimate of Rs 77,000 crore."
12256,2000-01,"Major increases in nonplan expenditure are on account of pension payments Rs 4,173 crore, interest payments Rs 3,425 crore, Extended Ways and Means Advances to States Rs 3,000 crore, Defence Rs 2,810 crore, Interest subsidies Rs 1,304 crore, food subsidy Rs 1,000 crore, postal deficit Rs 848 crore and assistance to States from the National Calamity Relief Fund Rs 1,064 crore."
12257,2000-01,"On the plan side, main increases are on account of National Highway Development Rs 1,900 crore, State roads Rs 1,000 crore, Railway safety  Rs 200 crore, special assistance to Jammu and Kashmir and enhanced assistance to States for externally aided projects."
12258,2000-01,About Rs 500 crore are expected to be released for projects/schemes in the North Eastern Region and Sikkim out of the savings from the budget of different Central Ministries.
12259,2000-01,"Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated at Rs 1,26,469 crore against Rs 1,32,365 crore budgeted, reflecting a shortfall of about Rs 5,900 crore."
12260,2000-01,The shortfall is mainly due to lower customs revenue because of very low growth in the dollar value of nonoil imports and lower excise revenue resulting from low inflation in manufactured products for most of the year.
12261,2000-01,"Disinvestment receipts are expected to be Rs 2,600 crore against Rs 10,000 crore budgeted."
12262,2000-01,The fiscal deficit is thus likely to increase to 5.6% of GDP from the budget target of 4.0%.
12263,2000-01,Budget Estimates for 20002001 6 4 .
12264,2000-01,"In the budget estimates for 20002001, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 3,38,487 crore, of which Rs 88,100 crore is for plan and Rs 2,50,387 crore for nonplan."
12265,2000-01,"The budget support for Central, State and UT Plans has been placed at Rs 88,100 crore, marking an increase of Rs 8,705 crore over revised estimates 15 19992000."
12266,2000-01,"Gross budgetary support for the Central Plan is being enhanced from Rs 43,661 crore in the revised estimates 19992000 to Rs 51,276 crore."
12267,2000-01,"Total Central Plan outlay at Rs 1,17,334 crore will be more by Rs 21,024 crore from the last year’s level of Rs 96,310 crore, a hefty 22% increase."
12268,2000-01,"The plan for 20002001 focuses on basic infrastructure with energy, transport and communications accounting for 60% of total Central Plan Outlay."
12269,2000-01,The Outlay for Social Services marks an increase of 21.5% over 19992000 R.E. 6 6 .
12270,2000-01,"Central Plan assistance to States and Union Territories in 20002001 is placed at Rs 36,824 crore as compared to Rs 35,735 crore in the revised estimates 19992000."
12271,2000-01,Non Plan Expenditure 6 7 .
12272,2000-01,"Nonplan expenditure in 20002001 is estimated to be Rs 2,50,387 crore compared to Rs 2,24,343 crore in Revised estimates for 19992000, showing an increase of Rs 26,044 crore."
12273,2000-01,"The increase in nonplan expenditure is mainly in defence Rs 10,083 crore, interest payments Rs 9,841 crore and in grants to States Rs 9,392 crore."
12274,2000-01,"However, this increase is sought to be partially offset by reduction in outgo on account of food and fertiliser subsidies."
12275,2000-01,"Major subsidies, on food and fertilizer, constitute a significant portion of our nonplan expenditure."
12276,2000-01,The rate at which these subsidy payments are growing is not sustainable.
12277,2000-01,"We need to target the subsidies to those who are poor and needy, whereas others should pay for what they consume."
12278,2000-01,"Indeed, we want to expand the access to subsidised food by Below Poverty Line BPL families so that they can meet their basic nutritional needs."
12279,2000-01,"Accordingly, from next year, we are doubling the allocation of foodgrains to BPL families, under the Targetted PDS, from 10 Kg."
12280,2000-01,This will result in an enormous gain in food security for our poorest families.
12281,2000-01,"The issue price of foodgrains of BPL families is being fixed at 50% of economic cost in line with the decision taken by Government in December, 1996."
12282,2000-01,The net effect of these measures will be to improve the monetary food budget of BPL families and vastly enhance their food security.
12283,2000-01,This achievement is possible only by simultaneously fixing the PDS issue price for APL families at the economic cost.
12284,2000-01,"In respect of sugar, no allocation will be made under PDS for income tax assessees."
12285,2000-01,"For others, keeping in view the increase in the levy price of sugar, the issue price under PDS is being fixed at Rs 13 per kg."
12286,2000-01,"As a result of these measures I expect to keep the expenditure on food and sugar subsidy at Rs 8,210 crore in 20002001."
12287,2000-01,"In the case of Fertilizer Subsidy, Members are aware that our present Retention Price Scheme suffers from many shortcomings."
12288,2000-01,Much of the subsidy goes to producers and not to farmers.
12289,2000-01,"To encourage greater efficiency of our fertilizer units, some rationalisation of the Retention Price Scheme, including capping of capital related charges, will be implemented from next year."
12290,2000-01,The Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers will also bring out soon a road map for phasing out the Retention Price Scheme in the mediumterm.
12291,2000-01,"Separately, to take into account the rising cost of inputs, the maximum retail price of Urea is being raised by 15%."
12292,2000-01,The rate of concession in the case of decontrolled fertilizer is also being reduced.
12293,2000-01,"However, to moderate the impact on prices the MRP of DAP and MOP is being raised only by 7% and 15% respectively."
12294,2000-01,"I expect that, because of these changes and some rationalisation of 16 Retention Price Scheme, the expenditure on fertilizer subsidy will be Rs 12,651 crore in 20002001."
12295,2000-01,The Eleventh Finance Commission has since submitted its interim report for making provisional arrangements of tax devolution and grants to States for 2000 2001.
12296,2000-01,"Government have accepted the devolution formula and quantum of grants to States, as recommended by the Commission in its interim report."
12297,2000-01,I have made provisions in the budget accordingly.
12298,2000-01,"PART B Sir, I now present my tax proposals."
12299,2000-01,I take up indirect taxes first.
12300,2000-01,Hon’ble Members are aware that both the Centre and the States depend heavily on indirect taxes.
12301,2000-01,"While I did carry out a major restructuring of the excise rates last year, the process needs to be taken further."
12302,2000-01,"We need to overhaul the rate structure, rationalise and simplify the procedures to reduce the compliance cost for the tax payer."
12303,2000-01,We must ensure that we concentrate on increasing production and absorbing new technologies rather than frittering away our energies on tax disputes.
12304,2000-01,"Sir, my proposals in excise intend to establish a single rate Central Value Added Tax CENVAT at the Centre."
12305,2000-01,"I am convinced that nothing short of this can provide long term stability, remove uncertainties in the mind of industry, and eliminate disputes of classification."
12306,2000-01,This will also encourage the States to implement their agreed programme for converting their sales taxes into VAT by 1.4.2001.
12307,2000-01,"The House may recall that in my last budget, I had introduced three ad valorem rates of basic excise duty, viz., 8%, 16% and 24%."
12308,2000-01,I propose to converge these three advalorem rates to a single rate of 16% CENVAT.
12309,2000-01,The 8% excise rate is therefore being abolished and most of the items at this rate are being moved to 16%.
12310,2000-01,"However, certain items, essentially covering medicare and items of use by the common man, are being exempted from the excise duty."
12311,2000-01,"These are: Medical Items: ♦ Medicinal grade oxygen ♦ Medicinal grade hydrogen peroxide ♦ Anaesthetics ♦ Potassium iodate ♦ Medical and surgical gloves; and Items of common use  ♦ Cutlery and knives ♦ House hold glassware, including glassware produced by mouth blown process ♦ Electric bulbs of MRP up to Rs 20 per bulb 17 ♦ Clocks and watches of MRP up to Rs 500 per piece ♦ Tooth powder ♦ Sanitary towels, napkins for babies, etc, and ♦ Soap for distribution through PDS 76."
12312,2000-01,I am including roasted chicory in the list of exempted items as coffee itself is free from excise duty.
12313,2000-01,"I have also decided to exempt specified cold chain equipment, which had been provided a low rate of 8% in the last budget, from excise duty in the larger public interest."
12314,2000-01,"Some items, on account of their exceptional nature and sensitivity to price increases, deserve special treatment, at least for the present."
12315,2000-01,"These are Kerosene, LPG, Laundry soap, Cotton yarn, including cotton sewing thread, and some other varieties of yarns and Diesel engines up to 10 HP."
12316,2000-01,"The rate structure for these is, therefore, being so designed that there is no increase in the incidence of excise from the current level of 8%, and thus there will be no price increase on this account."
12317,2000-01,I have not made any change in the list of items that are currently charged to 16% excise duty.
12318,2000-01,"In addition to the 16% CENVAT rate, I propose to have three rates of special excise of 8%, 16% and 24%."
12319,2000-01,"Unlike the CENVAT rate, the special excise duties will not generally be modvatable, that is, users will not be able to avail of MODVAT credit of these duties."
12320,2000-01,"For the items that are mainly in the nature of raw materials or intermediates, the 16% CENVAT rate is appropriate."
12321,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to include items like plastic materials, films and sheets of plastic, tread rubber, cellular rubber, articles of rubber, nylon filament yarn, transmission and conveyor belts of textile materials, and sacks and bags made of synthetic textile materials in the list of 16% CENVAT, from the current level of 24%."
12322,2000-01,"I am also including tyres for OE supplies and parts of air conditioning and refrigerating machinery in the list of 16% CENVAT, without subjecting them to any special excise duty, since they are intermediate goods in the chain of production."
12323,2000-01,"In addition, I am reducing the duty burden on a few other products that are also currently charged to 24% duty."
12324,2000-01,"These items are sterile contact lens solution, shikakai powder without additives, and cars for physically handicapped persons."
12325,2000-01,I feel that these items should not be loaded with a duty burden of more than 16% CENVAT.
12326,2000-01,Ambulances purchased by registered hospitals are currently charged to a concessional rate of excise duty of 16%.
12327,2000-01,I am extending the same treatment to ambulances purchased by Indian Red Cross Society.
12328,2000-01,"The other items that are currently charged to 24% duty shall continue to bear the same incidence, comprising 16% CENVAT and 8% special excise duty."
12329,2000-01,"In my new design of excise duty structure, the items that are now charged 18 to a total duty of 30% would be subjected to a total duty of 32%, composed of 16% CENVAT and 16% special excise duty."
12330,2000-01,"This is only a marginal increase of 2%, which, I am sure, the consumers of these commodities can afford to bear."
12331,2000-01,Items presently charged to a total duty of 40% will now be composed of 16% CENVAT and 24% special excise duty.
12332,2000-01,"However, soft drink concentrate supplied to bottlers will be charged to CENVAT at 16% only, being modvatable."
12333,2000-01,Let me now take up the MODVAT scheme and the changes that I plan to bring about.
12334,2000-01,MODVAT scheme shall now be known as CENVAT scheme.
12335,2000-01,"Over the years, disputes between the department and assessees on the interpretation of MODVAT rules and procedures have plagued the system."
12336,2000-01,I propose to put an end to this situation.
12337,2000-01,"With effect from 1st April 2000, the plethora of existing rules will be replaced by a small set of simple and transparent rules, which, I am sure , shall reduce disputes to a minimum."
12338,2000-01,I also propose to expand and rationalize the scope of the MODVAT scheme.
12339,2000-01,All inputs and all capital goods are now included in the eligible list of MODVAT scheme.
12340,2000-01,The only exception will be High Speed Diesel Oil and Petrol.
12341,2000-01,"However, I propose that the availability of MODVAT credit on capital goods will be spread over a period of two years, with effect from 1st April 2000."
12342,2000-01,"My proposals include full extension of MODVAT scheme to cigarettes for the first time, which should cheer the industry."
12343,2000-01,"However, the good news for the cigarette manufacturers ends here."
12344,2000-01,I propose to enhance the rates of excise duty on all categories of cigarettes by 5 %.
12345,2000-01,"At present, MODVAT credit of CVD paid on project imports is restricted to the extent of 75%."
12346,2000-01,This has been an irritant.
12347,2000-01,This credit shall now be available for 100% of the CVD.
12348,2000-01,I have also decided to do away with the condition of installation as a prerequisite for taking credit on capital goods.
12349,2000-01,Now I shall deal with some sector specific proposals.
12350,2000-01,I take up steel first.
12351,2000-01,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, an advalorem structure of taxation is largely free from distortions, equitable and automatically buoyant."
12352,2000-01,"For the present, I propose to restore advalorem excise duty structure on steel produced by rerollers and also to steel produced by induction furnaces."
12353,2000-01,"These goods would be subjected to CENVAT of 16%, with MODVAT benefit, from 1st April 2000."
12354,2000-01,I may add that capacity based tax applicable to rerollers and induction furnaces has created more problems than it has solved.
12355,2000-01,"Under the existing law, excise duty on goods sold from the depots is charged on the basis of depot price and not the factory gate price."
12356,2000-01,I have received representations that this has caused distortion in the marketability and distribution of steel.
12357,2000-01,"Deliveries of steel by integrated steel plants, whether from the plant or stockyard, will henceforth be assessed to duty at the factory gate price."
12358,2000-01,"Sir, now I turn to the textile industry."
12359,2000-01,I had introduced a compounded levy scheme for independent textile processors in December 1998.
12360,2000-01,"This has not worked as well as expected and has led to leakages and revenue losses; still, I do not wish to disturb the scheme abruptly."
12361,2000-01,"However, to rectify the situation, I propose to raise the rates of compounded levy from the existing Rs 1.5 lakhs per chamber per month to Rs 2 lakhs per chamber per month and from Rs 2 lakhs per chamber per month to Rs 2.5 lakhs per chamber per month."
12362,2000-01,My proposals also include some modifications in the scheme in order to plug the loopholes.
12363,2000-01,Units engaged in the texturising of duty paid polyester yarn would henceforth pay specific rate of excise duty.
12364,2000-01,This should reduce the valution disputes in respect of these units.
12365,2000-01,Small scale units enjoy duty free exemption on clearances up to Rs 50 lakhs a year.
12366,2000-01,I am unable to raise this limit.
12367,2000-01,"However, with effect from 1st April 2000, I propose to rationalize the special schemes prevalent for cosmetics and toilet preparations, airconditioning and refrigerating machinery and their parts, tread rubber and articles of plastics to fall in line with the general scheme of exemption for small scale units."
12368,2000-01,"Sir, I now come to the next part of my proposals which relate to streamlining and simplification of the system."
12369,2000-01,"These are aimed at unshackling the excise procedures from the slavery of complexities and rigidities, and making them simple and user friendly."
12370,2000-01,"I may add that like my raterelated proposals, these also go much beyond minor adjustments and mark a fundamental and even a dramatic departure from the current practices."
12371,2000-01,"With effect from 1st July 2000, all statutory records in excise would be dispensed with."
12372,2000-01,Excise department would rely upon the manufacturer’s records.
12373,2000-01,This completes the process initiated by me in my last budget in this regard.
12374,2000-01,"From 1st April 2000, excise assessees would be allowed to pay the excise dues in fortnightly instalments."
12375,2000-01,With this proposal I am putting an end to the age old practice of daytoday payment system of excise duties.
12376,2000-01,"For the small scale sector, the monthly payment scheme, that I had introduced last year, would continue."
12377,2000-01,"Next, I want to make the valuation mechanism simple, userfriendly and along commercially acceptable lines."
12378,2000-01,"From 1st July, 2000, I propose to replace the existing section 4 of Central Excise Act which is based on the concept of “normal price” by a new section based on “transaction value” for assessment."
12379,2000-01,This is a path breaking departure from the traditional approach.
12380,2000-01,The House is aware that several items are assessed to excise duty on the basis of Maximum Retail Price.
12381,2000-01,This system is largely free from disputes and has been generally welcomed by the industry.
12382,2000-01,I propose to extend MRP based assessment to about two dozen new items.
12383,2000-01,I also propose to extend this scheme to more items during the course of the year.
12384,2000-01,I also propose to rationalize the rates of duties applicable to medicines and toilet preparations under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Excise Duties Act.
12385,2000-01,The MRPbased assessment provisions are also being extended for assessment under this Act.
12386,2000-01,These measures would considerably simplify the collection of excise duty by the States and improve their revenues from these duties.
12387,2000-01,These changes will come into force from a notified date.
12388,2000-01,In addition to the above I am rationalizing the provisions relating to payment of interest and penalty on default.
12389,2000-01,The details are contained in the Finance Bill.
12390,2000-01,This completes my package of restructuring and rationalisation on the excise side.
12391,2000-01,Trade and Industry should now breathe easy.
12392,2000-01,I shall now deal with my proposals relating to customs duties.
12393,2000-01,"I am conscious that in this area, I face serious constraints."
12394,2000-01,We have to maintain a judicious balance between the need for providing adequate protection and growth impulses to the domestic industry and calibrating tariffs to international levels.
12395,2000-01,We also need to carry the reform and rationalization process further.
12396,2000-01,"Taking all factors into consideration, I propose to reduce the peak rate of basic customs duty from 40% to 35%, thereby reducing the total number of customs duty rates from 5 to 4, i.e. 35%, 25%, 15% and 5%."
12397,2000-01,"The surcharge of 10%, which I am constrained to continue on revenue considerations, will also apply to the new peak rate of 35%."
12398,2000-01,"Crude oil and petroleum products, certain WTO bound items and gold and silver would continue to be exempt."
12399,2000-01,The House may recall that I had imposed a special additional duty SAD of customs in my budget proposals for 199899.
12400,2000-01,This had made manufacturer importers quite sad.
12401,2000-01,But traders were glad because they were exempted.
12402,2000-01,I am correcting the discrimination by withdrawing this exemption.
12403,2000-01,Now all importers would pay this duty.
12404,2000-01,"SAD would, however, not apply to petroleum products."
12405,2000-01,"Consequent to our international trade treaty obligations, several hundred items will be placed on the free list for imports effective 1.4.2000."
12406,2000-01,Most of these are consumer goods and a number of them are agricultural products.
12407,2000-01,"To accord adequate tariff protection for these items, they are being placed at the peak rate 35% plus surcharge, except for a few items like capital goods."
12408,2000-01,A number of agricultural and horticultural products placed on the free list of import in earlier years are also being brought to the peak rate to ensure adequate protection to our farmers.
12409,2000-01,"Furthermore, for a handful of sensitive agricultural products wheat, rice, sugar and edible oils, in which our experience with supply management has underlined the importance of occasional tariff adjustments, I am making suitable enabling provisions to fix the statutory tariff rates at appropriately high levels."
12410,2000-01,This will give the necessary flexibility for adjusting the applied rates.
12411,2000-01,Customs is not all about raising revenues.
12412,2000-01,It is also a powerful tool for building our industrial capabilities and improving our international competitiveness.
12413,2000-01,"I propose to take several measures in this regard, picking up three sectors for special attention."
12414,2000-01,These are integral parts of the “convergence revolution” which is fast becoming a reality.
12415,2000-01,"First, and foremost, the Information Technology IT sector, which leads the current excitement."
12416,2000-01,I propose to reduce the customs duty on several items for 21 the IT sector.
12417,2000-01,"These include: ♦ Computers, from 20% to 15%; ♦ Mother boards, from 20% to 15%; ♦ Floppy diskettes, from 20% to 15%; ♦ Specified capital goods for manufacture of semi conductors and ICs, from 15% to 5%."
12418,2000-01,"To become an economic superpower we must get connected, domestically and globally."
12419,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the basic customs duty on specified raw materials for manufacture of optical fibres from 15% to 5%."
12420,2000-01,"I also propose to reduce the duty on cellular phones from 25% to 5% to improve their availability through proper channels and to curb the menace of the grey market, and on their battery packs from 40% to 15%."
12421,2000-01,I am extending the concessional rate of 5% basic duty applicable to specified telecom equipment to internet service providers also.
12422,2000-01,"The third is the entertainment industry, which is also an area of great promise."
12423,2000-01,"To reduce the cost of cinematography for the film industry and provide access to the latest technology, I propose to reduce duty on cinematographic cameras, and other related equipment from 40% to 25%."
12424,2000-01,I also propose to reduce the basic customs duty on colour positive films in jumbo rolls and colour negative films in rolls of certain sizes from 15% to 5%.
12425,2000-01,They shall also be exempt from CVD.
12426,2000-01,I would like to cover one more sector in this context.
12427,2000-01,"India can be a world leader in jewellery exports, as it is for gems."
12428,2000-01,I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on platinum and nonindustrial diamonds from 40% to 15% in order to encourage production of quality jewellery and to provide a fillip to jewellery exports.
12429,2000-01,"To give effect to our agreements with the European Union and the United States, I propose to adjust the customs duties on fibres, yarns, textile fabrics and garments."
12430,2000-01,"As a result, several varieties of fabrics and garments would henceforth be subjected to the higher of advalorem or specific rates of duties prescribed for them."
12431,2000-01,"As far as petroleum sector is concerned, the international prices of crude oil and petroleum products prevalent over some time now have been putting considerable strain on our refineries and distorting the oil pool account."
12432,2000-01,This is accentuated by the fact that prices of petroleum products have not been fully decontrolled so far.
12433,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the basic customs duty on crude oil from 20% to 15% and on petroleum products from 30% to 25%, except on kerosene for parallel marketing, the basic duty on which is being raised to 35%, from 30%."
12434,2000-01,In several cases the bound rates are to be reduced as part of our international commitment.
12435,2000-01,I do not wish to take the time of the House by going into details.
12436,2000-01,But they do have some revenue implications.
12437,2000-01,"Mr. Speaker Sir, last year, I had proposed the abolition of Finance Minister’s discretionery power to grant ad hoc exemptions of customs and excise duties except for goods of strategic nature, or for charitable purposes."
12438,2000-01,I am pleased to inform the House that this selfdenying rule has helped the Government save about Rs 500 crore this year.
12439,2000-01,"I shall now mention a few small, but significant, measures for procedural improvements and redressal of the problems of taxpayers."
12440,2000-01,"To curtail the so called “show cause notice Raj ” in customs and central excise, I have decided that henceforth, show cause notices involving duty amount of more than Rs 1 crore would be issued only with the approval of the Chief Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise."
12441,2000-01,Other show cause notices would require approval of the Commissioner of Customs and Central Excise.
12442,2000-01,It cannot be disputed that the tax due from a defaulter should flow to the exchequer at the earliest in public interest.
12443,2000-01,"At present, penalty equal to 100% of the duty evaded is payable, and this is mandatory, even if someone makes the payment immediately after the adjudication order is passed."
12444,2000-01,"With a view to encouraging payment of tax due, I have now proposed that if the amount of tax evaded is paid along with interest within 30 days of the communication of the order, a penalty equal to only 25% of the duty evaded would be payable."
12445,2000-01,"I hope this carrot will be found preferable to the stick, which is bound to follow if tax is not paid in time."
12446,2000-01,Service tax is emerging as an area of promise as well as problems.
12447,2000-01,Many experts advise me that the best way to deal with this tax is to make it applicable to all services in one go.
12448,2000-01,"However, some others have suggested basic changes in the very structure of the service tax."
12449,2000-01,I have decided not to make any changes for the present.
12450,2000-01,"I am setting up an Expert Group to go into all aspects of the matter, review the experience so far, and give me its considered advice."
12451,2000-01,"My proposals on the excise side are estimated to result in revenue gain of Rs 3,252 crore in a year."
12452,2000-01,"On the customs side, my proposals are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 1,428 crore."
12453,2000-01,Copies of the notifications issued to give effect to the changes in excise and customs duties shall be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
12454,2000-01,I now turn to my Direct Tax proposals.
12455,2000-01,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, my edifice of Direct Tax proposals rests on four pillars of stability, economic growth, rationalisation and simplification."
12456,2000-01,"Our existing rates of personal taxation at 10%, 20% and 30% are only three in number and quite moderate."
12457,2000-01,"Although the basic exemption limit is Rs 50,000, the real exemption limit goes much higher when the other exemptions and deductions are taken into account."
12458,2000-01,"For example, salaried persons start paying tax only on crossing Rs 75,000 per year because of the standard deduction."
12459,2000-01,"If the tax rebates and 23 deductions available for savings are taken into account, the effective limit of exemption gets close to Rs 1 lakh."
12460,2000-01,Thus I feel that the present rates of taxation as well as the exemption limit are reasonable.
12461,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to maintain them at the same levels."
12462,2000-01,"Although the 10% surcharge imposed last year was meant to be temporary, I am constrained to continue with it, in view of the heavy and unexpected expenditure burden, mainly on account of defence requirements and transfer to states mandated by the Finance Commission."
12463,2000-01,"Having restrained myself from imposing any additional taxes during the course of the year when there was much talk of a Kargil tax, I now propose increasing the surcharge moderately from 10% to 15% on noncorporate tax payers having total taxable income above Rs 1,50,000 per year."
12464,2000-01,This will slightly increase their marginal rate from 33% to 34.5%.
12465,2000-01,I trust that these relatively betteroff sections of society would bear this additional burden cheerfully.
12466,2000-01,"Lest it is felt that I am being discriminatory in not increasing the surcharge on corporates, let me clarify that they would also get their opportunity to contribute to the national effort in other ways a little later."
12467,2000-01,"Despite the financial constraints, I would like to propose some positive measures on personal taxation."
12468,2000-01,"As an expression of our gratitude to the contribution made by senior citizens during their active years and taking into account the possible hardships that they face in the advanced years of their life, I propose to raise the tax rebate available to them from Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000."
12469,2000-01,"At the marginal tax rate of 30%, this translates into an exemption of an additional Rs 15,000 from their gross income, or substitutes the need to save an additional Rs 25,000 to avail of a similar exemption under section 88."
12470,2000-01,"I have always maintained that despite all challenges, my job as Finance Minister in making a budget is easier than that of an average housewife struggling to balance the family budget."
12471,2000-01,"As a token of appreciation and recognition of women as productive contributors to the economy, I propose an additional rebate of Rs 5,000 for women taxpayers from their tax liability."
12472,2000-01,"This would be subject to the overall ceiling of Rs 15,000 if they also happen to be senior citizens."
12473,2000-01,"With a view to acknowledging the services rendered by the members of defence forces and in token of our gratitude for their exceptional courage and valour, I had provided exemption from tax for the pension and family pension of gallantry award winners of these services."
12474,2000-01,I now propose to extend similar benefits to gallantry award winners of para military forces and other forces engaged in national and civil defence.
12475,2000-01,I now turn to the role of taxation as a facilitator of economic growth.
12476,2000-01,Knowledgebased industries are fast emerging as the frontrunners of the Indian 24 economy.
12477,2000-01,"To accelerate their growth, and encourage investment in them as mentioned in Part A of my speech, I propose to introduce a new regime for venture capital funds."
12478,2000-01,The highlights of this would be: i
12479,2000-01,No approval of Venture Capital Funds by tax authorities would be required.
12480,2000-01,"The principle of “pass through” would be applied in tax treatment of Venture Capital Funds, whose income would be free of tax, except when not distributed within the period that may be prescribed in the guidelines of SEBI."
12481,2000-01,"Income in the hands of its investors, which would otherwise be taxable, would also be kept tax free, and there would only be a onetime payment of tax by the Venture Capital Fund at the rate of 20%, when the Fund distributes its income to the investors."
12482,2000-01,The same rate would apply to undistributed incomes also.
12483,2000-01,I hope these incentives will facilitate the coming together of Saraswati i.e. knowledge and Laxmi i.e. wealth to bless entrepreneurs and investors.
12484,2000-01,Various tax benefits are already available for the infrastructure sector.
12485,2000-01,"I propose to extend these benefits to two additional and essential sectors of urban infrastructure, viz."
12486,2000-01,I also propose to include investments in public companies providing long term finance for urban infrastructure as approved investments for charitable trusts.
12487,2000-01,This will enable more investment in projects for development of urban infrastructure.
12488,2000-01,"To provide a more focussed incentive for infrastructure development, I propose to delete the existing provisions 54EA and 54EB and replace them with a new provision, whereby tax exemption from capital gains would be available only if investment is made in bonds to be issued by National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD and the National Highways Authority of India NHAI."
12489,2000-01,These bonds will have a lockin period of five years and their proceeds will be used for providing finance to the agricultural sector and for the National Highway Development Project NHDP.
12490,2000-01,"I propose to continue the thrust given to the housing sector last year and extend the benefits already available for two more years, i.e. for houses or projects which are completed by 31st March 2003."
12491,2000-01,I hope this will sustain and accelerate house construction activity.
12492,2000-01,"To supplement the package of incentives of this sector, I also propose that the 20% rebate of tax under section 88 of the Incometax Act would now be available for repayment of housing loans up to Rs  20,000 per year as against Rs 10,000 earlier."
12493,2000-01,"Presently, the exemption from tax on longterm capital gains is not available if the capital gain from transfer of capital assets is invested in a house, if one house is already owned."
12494,2000-01,I am removing this restriction.
12495,2000-01,"Even if they own one house, taxpayers can make an investment in a new house and claim exemption from capital gains tax on sale of capital assets."
12496,2000-01,Last year I had provided for 100% exemption on export profits to the entertainment industry.
12497,2000-01,"However, this benefit was limited to corporate entities only."
12498,2000-01,I propose to extend the benefits available to corporates to noncorporate assessees as well with effect from Financial Year 19992000.
12499,2000-01,"This will remove the perceived discrimination to the noncorporate film makers, but I do hope that this industry will move towards corporatisation and modernization rapidly which is possible without in any way curbing individual creativity."
12500,2000-01,"To address a longstanding demand of the entertainment industry and with a view to streamlining the procedures, I also propose to increase the limit of reporting of payments made by a film producer, during production of a film, to the tax authorities to Rs 50, 000 from the present level of Rs 25,000."
12501,2000-01,"I hope these concessions combined with what I have already done on the indirect tax side, will reassure the entertainment industry that “Hum Saath Saath Hain”."
12502,2000-01,"Shipping provides the transportation sinews to our international trade, and has a strategic relevance also."
12503,2000-01,"To enable the Indian Shipping Industry, which is facing serious challenges, to generate resources for strengthening and modernising its fleet, I propose to allow deduction of their entire profits, against 50% as at present, if these are kept in a reserve to be used for purchase of new ships."
12504,2000-01,This 100% deduction would be available for five years beginning from the next year.
12505,2000-01,Investment in human resources is an essential precursor for sustainable economic development.
12506,2000-01,"To enable meritorious students, especially those from not so affluent backgrounds, to avail of opportunities for higher education, I propose to increase the maximum amount of repayment of loan for higher education from Rs 25,000 to Rs 40,000 as an allowable deduction."
12507,2000-01,"This would translate into loan amounts exceeding Rs  3 lakhs, which would help such students to defray the increasing cost of higher education, especially in management and professional courses."
12508,2000-01,Availability of vocational training can go a long way in mitigating the problem of unemployment.
12509,2000-01,It can also bridge the paradoxical mismatch between wide spread unemployment on the one hand and a shortage of properly trained manpower on the other.
12510,2000-01,In order to remedy the situation I propose to allow 100% deduction of payments made for the establishment and running of institutions for vocational education and training by the private sector in rural areas and small towns.
12511,2000-01,"Barring some significant but scattered achievements, we are not a major force in the international sports arena."
12512,2000-01,"Like many other activities, modern sports and athletics need money and infrastructure for their development."
12513,2000-01,"While some sports have access to abundant funding, most others suffer for want of adequate support."
12514,2000-01,"To rectify this situation, I propose that 100% deduction would be available for donations made by corporate entities to the Indian Olympic Association for the development of infrastructure and for the sponsorship of games and sports."
12515,2000-01,"I hope that with this concession, IOC would be better equipped to promote sports in the 26 country."
12516,2000-01,"Last year, my proposals on corporate restructuring were widely welcomed by Indian industry."
12517,2000-01,"However, there have been persistent demands to clarify and rationalise some of the provisions."
12518,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to remove ambiguities in this regard by making suitable changes in the provisions of the Income tax Act."
12519,2000-01,I also propose that resulting companies as a consequence of splitting of statutory bodies like SEBs will enjoy the benefits of demerger if they fulfil the conditions notified by the Central Government.
12520,2000-01,"Last year, I had dispensed with the condition of continuity of the same business for carry forward and set off of loss."
12521,2000-01,I propose to liberalise the provisions relating to carry forward and set off of unabsorbed depreciation on the same lines.
12522,2000-01,The condition of continuity of same business will be dispensed with and unabsorbed depreciation may be carried forward and setoff even if the same business is not continued.
12523,2000-01,"To give greater restructuring flexibility and freedom to the corporates, including PSUs, I propose to make the conditions for tax exemption of voluntary retirement benefits of employees more liberal and to simplify the procedure for tax exemption of benefits given to employees of Public companies and Cooperative Societies."
12524,2000-01,It will not be necessary any longer to obtain the approval of the tax authorities for their voluntary retirement schemes if these are formulated in accordance with the prescribed guidelines.
12525,2000-01,The various exemptions currently available while calculating Minimum Alternate Tax MAT and the credit system has undermined the efficacy of the existing provision and has also led to legal complications.
12526,2000-01,"To address these issues, I propose that the Minimum Alternate Tax be now levied at the revised rate of 7.5% of the “book profits” as determined under the Companies Act instead of the existing effective rate of 10.5%."
12527,2000-01,"However, this will now be uniformly applied – barring one exception that I will mention later."
12528,2000-01,There will also be no credit for Minimum Alternate Tax paid.
12529,2000-01,"This should bring all zero tax companies within the taxnet, which is also the basic purpose of this tax."
12530,2000-01,"The new system has the virtue of a lowered rate of tax, a simple method of computation, and an equitable spread."
12531,2000-01,"To promote industrialization in less developed areas, I propose to extend the tax holiday available for new units set up in industrially backward States and industrially backward Districts for another two years."
12532,2000-01,"Similarly, I also propose to extend the existing tax benefit for new Small Scale industrial units for another two years, i.e., till 31st March, 2002."
12533,2000-01,"To strengthen our capital market, I propose to provide 100% exemption to the income of Investor Protection Funds of Stock Exchanges to give them incentives for setting up of such funds."
12534,2000-01,"At present, no tax is payable in the hands of shareholders on the dividend income received from a domestic company, only the company pays additional income 27 tax at the rate of 10% on the amount of dividends distributed by them."
12535,2000-01,The large gap in the tax treatment of dividend income and interest income has been widely criticized.
12536,2000-01,"To reduce this anomaly, I propose to increase the rate of tax on dividends distributed by domestic companies from 10% to 20%."
12537,2000-01,I would clarify that dividend income in the hands of share holders will continue to remain tax free.
12538,2000-01,"In a similar vein, to reduce the distortions arising out of the differing tax treatment for interest incomes from mutual funds and other instruments, like bank deposits and corporate deposits, I propose to increase the rate of tax on income distributed by debt oriented Mutual Funds and UTI from 10% to 20%."
12539,2000-01,"However, I would like to clarify that the income distributed under the US64 and other open ended equity oriented schemes of UTI and Mutual Funds will continue to be exempt from this tax, as at present."
12540,2000-01,"Currently, banks and financial institutions pay an interest tax of 2%, which adds to their cost."
12541,2000-01,"To remove this impediment to financial transactions, I propose to abolish this tax."
12542,2000-01,"This is a significant measure which will benefit the financial sector, and consequently the depositors and users of the products and services of the banks and financial institutions."
12543,2000-01,The life insurance sector is now opened up and would no longer remain a public sector monopoly.
12544,2000-01,It is currently taxed at a special rate which is likely to need a revision in the altered scenario.
12545,2000-01,I would like to undertake such revision on the basis of expert advice and in the light of international practice.
12546,2000-01,I propose to constitute an Expert Committee for this purpose and I hope to bring necessary amendments based on its recommendations during the course of the year.
12547,2000-01,One of the major initiatives towards better tax compliance has been the introduction of the onebysix scheme.
12548,2000-01,"This, along with other measures, has contributed substantially to increasing the number of taxpayers, which had languished at the level of just over a crore till 19961997, but has now crossed the two crore mark, with the biggest boost coming over the last two years."
12549,2000-01,The momentum generated by this and other measures to widen the tax base needs to be sustained.
12550,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to extend the onebysix scheme from the existing 54 cities to an additional 79 cities in the country."
12551,2000-01,"With this, all the cities having a population of two lakh and more on the basis of the 1991 Census would stand covered."
12552,2000-01,"In keeping with international practice, it is proposed to promote a common Business Identification Number to be used by different agencies and departments."
12553,2000-01,"In our context, the Permanent Account Number of incometax would be that instrument."
12554,2000-01,"To begin with, the CBEC and DGFT will use PAN for their assessees, importers and exporters."
12555,2000-01,"I hope that in near future, the PAN card will replace the ration card as the primary identification document for a sizeable number of people."
12556,2000-01,"With a view to intensifying the drive for PAN allotment, I propose to open special counters in all cities where the onebysix scheme will be in operation including 79 cities where the scheme is being extended to issue PAN cards to the taxpayers within 30 days of their filing the application."
12557,2000-01,"This facility will become 28 operational with effect from the 1st of July, 2000."
12558,2000-01,A large number of farmhouses have come up in the vicinity of metropolitan and big cities.
12559,2000-01,Many of these generate commercial income from being hired out for residential accommodation and for holding functions and events.
12560,2000-01,"No tax is paid on this income, which is misdeclared as agricultural."
12561,2000-01,This blatant and visible misuse of an exemption originally intended only for genuine farmers cannot be condoned or allowed to continue.
12562,2000-01,"I, therefore, propose to make suitable changes in the law to ensure that the income from farmhouse from anything other than genuine agricultural operations will be brought in the tax net."
12563,2000-01,It is my earnest desire to make the system of tax collection as user friendly and efficient as possible.
12564,2000-01,"The tax payer should be able to pay taxes with speed, convenience and dignity."
12565,2000-01,"With this in view, I propose to expand and revamp the presently available facilities of tax collection to provide that taxpayers would be able to pay their tax in any branch of nationalised banks where they maintain an account."
12566,2000-01,"This facility would be available in all towns and cities covered under the onebysix scheme with effect from 1st August, 2000."
12567,2000-01,"For operational reasons, this facility would initially be offered in computerised branches only, but would be expanded continuously."
12568,2000-01,I also propose to further streamline the system of refunds.
12569,2000-01,"While the present practice of sending the refund cheques to the tax payers under advice to their banks would continue, the Tax Department would also offer the facility of issuing refunds directly on the bank accounts of assessees if the tax payers so desire."
12570,2000-01,"For operational reasons, this facility would also initially be started from computerised branches of banks, with continuous expansion as the banks get progressively computerised."
12571,2000-01,"With almost every sector of the economy expecting a special treatment, our Incometax Act has become a vast compilation of exemptions."
12572,2000-01,Income is income and should be taxed.
12573,2000-01,There should be no permanent exemptions.
12574,2000-01,"With this in view, I want to make a beginning towards rationalising the existing system of concessions and exemptions."
12575,2000-01,Export earnings of various kinds presently enjoy exemptions from incometax ranging from 50% to 100% of income.
12576,2000-01,"I have, therefore, decided to phase out these concessions over a period of five years."
12577,2000-01,"To begin with, I am withdrawing these concessions by 20% from the financial year 20002001, and by 20% each subsequent year till they reach a zero level."
12578,2000-01,I would add that exporters would continue to enjoy exemption from MAT till the full phase out.
12579,2000-01,The revenues garnered from this rationalization measure will help to finance universalization of primary education and other investments in human resources.
12580,2000-01,My rationalisation measures also include the following: ♦ Trusts running educational institutions and hospitals will not be denied exemption even if their trustees avail medical and educational facilities from them.
12581,2000-01,Such benefit alone will be taxed.
12582,2000-01,"To sum up, Mr. Speaker, Sir, as a result of various proposals made in this budget on the direct taxes, the estimated revenue in 20002001 would be Rs 72,105 crore, including the component of additional resource mobilisation of Rs 5,080 crore."
12583,2000-01,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these proposals I estimate total tax revenue receipts for the Centre at Rs 1,46,209 crore and the fiscal deficit at Rs 1,11,275 crore or 5.1% of GDP."
12584,2000-01,"I could have sought a deeper cut in the fiscal deficit, but a substantially higher level of revenue mobilization would have hurt the industrial recovery under way at present."
12585,2000-01,"Thus, in the shortrun, I had to carefully balance the need for fiscal consolidation with the need to nurture the recovery phase of a growth cycle."
12586,2000-01,I hope this august House will support the balance I have struck in this budget.
12587,2000-01,Growth is not just an end in itself.
12588,2000-01,"It is the critical vehicle for increasing employment and raising the living standards of our people, especially of the poorest."
12589,2000-01,"Sustained, broadbased growth, combined with all our programmes for accelerating rural development, building roads, promoting housing, boosting knowledgebased industries and enhancing the quality of human resources, will impart a strong impetus to employment expansion."
12590,2000-01,There can be no better cure for the problem of poverty than this in our country.
12591,2000-01,"Sir, the millennium has heralded the arrival of the Indian economy on the global stage."
12592,2000-01,"In two short years, we have shown that Indian talent and Indian effort is second to none."
12593,2000-01,In two short years we have ensured that “made in India” is a compliment for any product or service.
12594,2000-01,In two short years we have sent notice to the world that India will be an economic superpower in the 21st century.
12595,2000-01,"The world’s eyes are now upon us, and we will deliver."
12596,2000-01,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to this august House."
12597,2001-02,"Sir, I rise to present the Budget for the year 20012002."
12598,2001-02,I do so in all humility.
12599,2001-02,"The challenges we face this year are awesome, made more so by the tragedy and devastation caused by the Gujarat earthquake."
12600,2001-02,I hope I shall get the understanding and support of the whole House in my endeavour to meet these challenges.
12601,2001-02,The Indian economy has continued to exhibit both growth and resilience that have characterized its performance in the past few years.
12602,2001-02,Overall economic growth this year is expected to be about 6 per cent despite a series of unexpected setbacks.
12603,2001-02,We have had a second successive year of irregular monsoon resulting in low agricultural growth.
12604,2001-02,"World petroleum prices have continued to stay at high levels placing strains on the economy as a whole, and have led to a significant increase in inflation over the past year."
12605,2001-02,"Fortunately, despite the increase in energy prices, the prices of essential commodities, and of manufactured products as a whole, have remained stable."
12606,2001-02,"Inflation, excluding energy, was around 4 per cent during the year."
12607,2001-02,The economy remained secure with record levels of foreign exchange reserves and public food stocks.
12608,2001-02,The creditable export performance recorded last year improved further: exports grew by over 20 per cent in dollar terms in AprilDecember 2000.
12609,2001-02,It is now 10 years since economic reforms began in 1991.
12610,2001-02,"During this period, the economy has grown at an average rate of 6.4 per cent per year since 199293 compared to the 5.8 per cent recorded in the 1980s."
12611,2001-02,Poverty has fallen from 36 per cent in 199394 to 26 per cent or less now.
12612,2001-02,"While economic reforms have placed the country on a much more secure and sustained growth path, we still have some serious concerns and cannot afford to be complacent."
12613,2001-02,Agricultural reforms have been inadequate and our agriculture continues to be subject to the vagaries of the monsoon. ·
12614,2001-02,"Despite major industrial sector reforms, industrial growth has not accelerated to the doubledigit level as expected."
12615,2001-02,Inadequate fiscal adjustment has remained the most intractable problem over the past decade.
12616,2001-02,Public investment in infrastructure and social sectors is inadequate due to falling total public sector savings.
12617,2001-02,"Thus, despite the many achievements of economic reforms over the past decade, much remains to be done if we have to achieve our full potential."
12618,2001-02,There is urgent need to further deepen reforms to set the stage for higher growth over the next decade.
12619,2001-02,We have to intensify our effort in fiscal adjustment so that the generations to come are not burdened by our borrowing excesses.
12620,2001-02,The economy has achieved significant acceleration in growth over the last 20 years.
12621,2001-02,Our aspiration must be to achieve still higher growth in the next 20 years.
12622,2001-02,"The broad strategy of the budget, therefore, with this objective of growth in mind is to ensure: · Speeding up of agricultural sector reforms and better management of the food economy."
12623,2001-02,"Intensification of infrastructure investment, continued reform in the financial sector and capital markets, and deepening of structural reforms through removal of remaining tiresome controls constraining economic activity."
12624,2001-02,Human development through better educational opportunities and programmes of social security.
12625,2001-02,"Stringent expenditure control of nonproductive expenditure, rationalisation of subsidies and improvement in the quality of Government expenditure."
12626,2001-02,Acceleration of the privatisation process and restructuring of public enterprises.
12627,2001-02,Revenue enhancement through widening of the tax base and administration of a fair and equitable tax regime.
12628,2001-02,"As I have noted, reforms in the agriculture sector have been inadequate and must be speeded up."
12629,2001-02,The Government has already announced the first ever National Policy in Agriculture.
12630,2001-02,The provision of adequate credit flow is critical for agricultural production.
12631,2001-02,"Total credit flow to agriculture through institutional channels of commercial banks, cooperative banks and regional rural banks is estimated to have reached a level of Rs 51,500 crore this year, an increase of about 15 per cent over last year."
12632,2001-02,"It is expected to increase to Rs 64,000 crore in 20012002 representing an increase of 24 per cent."
12633,2001-02,"In order to ensure continued healthy growth of the agricultural sector, I propose the following steps: *"
12634,2001-02,"The operation of the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF, set up in 199596 with NABARD, has been very successful in upgrading rural infrastructure with about 1,84,000 projects sanctioned so far."
12635,2001-02,"To help the States, I have decided to reduce the interest rate charged by NABARD from 11.5 per cent to 10.5 per cent."
12636,2001-02,The corpus of RIDF VII will be increased from Rs 4500 crore to Rs 5000 crore next year.
12637,2001-02,The innovation of Kisan Credit Cards has proved to be very successful.
12638,2001-02,"Since the year of its introduction in 199899, almost 110 lakh of KCCs have been issued."
12639,2001-02,I am asking our banks to accelerate this programme and cover all eligible agricultural farmers within the next 3 years.
12640,2001-02,"I am also asking the banks to provide a personal insurance package to the KCC holders, as is often done with other credit cards, to cover them against accidental death or permanent disability, upto maximum amount of Rs 50,000 and Rs 25,000 respectively."
12641,2001-02,The premium burden will be shared by the card issuing institutions.
12642,2001-02,NABARD and SIDBI were asked to link one lakh SelfHelp Groups during the current year.
12643,2001-02,NABARD by itself is well poised to exceed this target by the end of next month.
12644,2001-02,"I expect NABARD to link 1 lakh additional Self Help Groups during 200102, which would help in providing access to credit to an additional 20 lakh families."
12645,2001-02,Sharecroppers and tenant farmers will also become eligible for this scheme and special attention will be given to SC/ST groups.
12646,2001-02,A micro finance development fund has also been set up in NABARD with contribution of Rs 40 crore each by NABARD and RBI.
12647,2001-02,I had permitted NABARD to issue capital gains tax exemption bonds last year.
12648,2001-02,This has helped NABARD to mobilise more than Rs 1000 crore at lower than normal interest rates thereby reducing its cost of funds.
12649,2001-02,I propose to continue with this tax exemption.
12650,2001-02,"The resources from the Watershed Development Fund set up in NABARD would be used to promote people’s participation and also enable water users’ associations to implement, operate and maintain irrigation schemes."
12651,2001-02,"In 1999, I had announced a credit linked subsidy scheme for construction of cold storages for perishable commodities."
12652,2001-02,"So far, NABARD and NCDC have provided Rs 161 crore of credit for creation of additional capacity of 9.69 lakh tonnes."
12653,2001-02,A 4 subsidy of Rs 78 crore for setting up these cold storages was provided during 2000 2001.
12654,2001-02,I now propose to extend the coverage of this scheme to also cover rural godowns.
12655,2001-02,The subsidy to be provided by the Government would be suitably enhanced to take care of increased coverage.
12656,2001-02,"The loans would carry an adequate longterm repayment period and would enable individuals, cooperative societies and others to build godowns by availing of loans from cooperative banks, commercial banks and RRBs."
12657,2001-02,This scheme will enable small farmers to enhance their holding capacity in order to sell their produce at remunerative prices.
12658,2001-02,"NABARD proposes to reduce its rate of interest for funding the storage of crops, from 10 per cent to 8.5 per cent."
12659,2001-02,Small farmers will particularly benefit from this scheme by avoiding distress sales.
12660,2001-02,"With the diversification and modernisation of agricultural practices, there is a need to augment support and extension services for agriculture."
12661,2001-02,"For this purpose, a scheme for setting up Agriclinics and Agribusiness Centres by agricultural graduates will be launched with the support of NABARD."
12662,2001-02,"These centres will provide a package of soil and input testing facilities and other consultancy services, They will strengthen transfer of technology and extension services and also provide selfemployment opportunities to technically trained persons."
12663,2001-02,Loans on attractive terms for setting up these centres will be provided by banks with refinance from NABARD.
12664,2001-02,There is a significant potential of improving crop productivity in the Eastern and North Eastern regions through crop diversification and adoption of improved technologies.
12665,2001-02,These regions also have large untapped ground water resources.
12666,2001-02,A sum of Rs 61 crore has been provided for the Centrally Sponsored Scheme on “On Farm Water Management for Increasing Crop Production in Eastern India”.
12667,2001-02,"I am also happy to inform the House that I have provided Rs 38 crore for the “Technology Mission for Integrated Development of Horticulture in the North Eastern States”, announced by me last year."
12668,2001-02,"In my last Budget, I had announced the launching of a new scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Gramodaya Yojana PMGY with the objective of undertaking time bound programmes to fulfill the critical needs of the rural people."
12669,2001-02,"As a follow up, particularly with the objective of achieving rural connectivity, the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana has been launched by the Hon’ble Prime Minister on December 25, 2000."
12670,2001-02,A Central allocation of Rs 2500 crore was provided for 200001.
12671,2001-02,I am providing another allocation of Rs 2500 crore for the coming year.
12672,2001-02,"It is a matter of concern that even after 50 years of planned development there are still about 80,000 villages, which do not have access to electricity."
12673,2001-02,A package of initiatives is therefore being launched to improve the power distribution system in rural areas.
12674,2001-02,This includes: * Completion of electrification of bulk of the remaining villages in the next 6 years.
12675,2001-02,Extension of assistance to the States for village electrification works under the PMGY whose funding is being augmented.
12676,2001-02,"Improving the quality of power supply in villages, augmentation of distribution networks in rural areas supported by REC under the Accelerated Power Development Programme."
12677,2001-02,"Augmenting the resources of REC, by allowing it to float capital gains tax exemption bonds along with NABARD and NHAI under Section 54 EC of the Income Tax Act."
12678,2001-02,Management of the Food Economy 17.
12679,2001-02,Increased production and rising productivity makes the proper management of the food economy more critical then ever before.
12680,2001-02,Our policy has to be transformed to deal with surpluses rather than only shortages.
12681,2001-02,The present arrangement of Government of India procuring foodgrains and States managing the PDS has led to many problems.
12682,2001-02,"While the subsidy has increased from Rs 8210 crore at B.E. to Rs 12,125 crore at R.E. stage this year, the satisfaction level has gone down."
12683,2001-02,"I propose, therefore, to give an enlarged role to the State Governments in both procurement and distribution of foodgrains for PDS in their respective states."
12684,2001-02,"Instead of providing subsidised foodgrains, financial assistance will be provided to the State Governments to enable them to procure and distribute foodgrains to BPL families at subsidised rates."
12685,2001-02,FCI will continue to procure foodgrains for maintaining food security reserves and for such State Governments who will assign it this task on their behalf.
12686,2001-02,Details for operationalising these arrangements will be worked out in consultation with the State Governments at the earliest.
12687,2001-02,The agricultural sector continues to be constrained by the existence of a number of inhibiting controls and regulations.
12688,2001-02,"The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 provides for the control of production, supply and distribution of certain commodities identified as essential commodities under the Act to protect the interest of consumers."
12689,2001-02,State Governments have issued a large number of Control Orders under this Act inhibiting free movement of some food and agriculture products.
12690,2001-02,In the changed present situation undue restrictions on movement and stocking of foodgrains and agricultural produce is acting as a disincentive to farmers.
12691,2001-02,"Government therefore proposes to review the operation of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955 and remove many of the restrictions that have been imposed on the free interState movement of foodgrains and agricultural produce and also on the storage and stocking of such commodities."
12692,2001-02,It will also review the list of commodities declared as essential under the said Act and bring their number down to the minimum required.
12693,2001-02,My colleague the Food Minister will issue necessary directions in this regard after consultations with the State Governments.
12694,2001-02,Rapid development of the economy depends on adequate investment in infrastructure.
12695,2001-02,A key issue here is imposition of appropriate user charges necessary 6 to provide adequate returns on investment.
12696,2001-02,Public resources have been invested in the public sector over the last 50 years for the provision of infrastructure services in the country.
12697,2001-02,One consequence of this has been that user charges have inevitably become politically determined.
12698,2001-02,"Over time nonmerit subsidies inherent in such low user charges have mounted to over 10 per cent of GDP, a figure similar to the total fiscal deficit of the Central and State Governments combined."
12699,2001-02,Hence they are a major cause of the fiscal distress being experienced at all levels.
12700,2001-02,I believe that this issue is now so important that it needs urgent discussion throughout the country.
12701,2001-02,The challenge is to achieve a consensus on the imposition of appropriate user charges in such a manner that the poor are protected while those who can pay are made to do so.
12702,2001-02,Only then will we be able to accelerate investment in these essential services in both the public and private sectors.
12703,2001-02,A prime example of this is the power sector.
12704,2001-02,The importance of power in fuelling economic growth cannot be over emphasised.
12705,2001-02,"The total cost to the State Electricity Boards of implicit subsidies amounts to about Rs 36,000 crore this year."
12706,2001-02,"After accounting for cross subsidy and State subventions, actual commercial losses of all SEBs combined are estimated to be about Rs 24,000 crore."
12707,2001-02,Hidden in these loss figures are extremely high T&D losses.
12708,2001-02,"Although all of these losses are borne by SEBs and State Governments, I have to express my concern on this issue since this is a massive national loss and affects Central Government undertakings also."
12709,2001-02,"The total dues owed to Central Government utilities by SEBs and others now amount to over Rs 25,000 crore."
12710,2001-02,"If these resources were available, the country would have no difficulty in investing adequately in power sector expansion to the benefit of all."
12711,2001-02,Theft of electricity must be stopped and economic tariffs levied.
12712,2001-02,The most vital element of the reform process is the restoration of financial viability of the State Electricity Boards SEBs.
12713,2001-02,"On the basis of consensus that has progressively emerged in the National Development Council Resolution of 1992, the Common Minimum National Action Programme drawn up in 1996 and the Power Ministers’ Conference of February 2000, the Central Government is accelerating the programme of reforms in SEBs on the basis of specific milestones that are being built into MOUs entered into with State Governments."
12714,2001-02,These MOUs include specific milestones such as: · A time bound programme for installation of 100 per cent metering by December 2001.
12715,2001-02,Energy audit at all levels.
12716,2001-02,A specific programme for reduction and eventual elimination of power theft.
12717,2001-02,Tariff determination by SERCs and compliance thereof.
12718,2001-02,Commercialisation of distribution and · SEB restructuring.
12719,2001-02,"To demonstrate the importance of this task, the Prime Minister will hold a meeting of State Chief Ministers on March 3, 2001."
12720,2001-02,MOUs have already been entered into with 5 States and we expect more States to adopt the reform process.
12721,2001-02,"Accordingly, plan allocation to the Accelerated Power Development Programme APDP has been stepped up to Rs 1500 crore next year from a level of Rs 1000 crore this year."
12722,2001-02,Priority under APDP would be given to those states that undertake such reform.
12723,2001-02,The key to restoration of financial viability is reform of distribution.
12724,2001-02,"Assistance from the Fiscal Reform Incentive Fund recommended by the 11th Finance Commission would also, interalia, be linked to the achievement of power reforms."
12725,2001-02,"The reforming States would also receive support from the Central Government in form of preferential allocation of power to SEBs from CPSUs, additional investment by CPSUs in generation and transmission, and preferential allocation of external aid."
12726,2001-02,"In order to help accelerate the reform process in the power sector and to unify all existing central legislations in the sector, my colleague the Minister for Power will introduce the Electricity Bill 2001 within this session."
12727,2001-02,"The Plan outlay for central sector power utilities is being raised from Rs 9,194 crore this year to Rs 10,030 crore for 200102."
12728,2001-02,This demonstrates the commitment of the Central Government to accelerate public sector power investment along with power sector reforms.
12729,2001-02,The National Highway Development Programme NHDP represents a new road vision for this country.
12730,2001-02,Its unprecedented scale is symbolic of government’s earnestness to provide connectivity and mobility of an altogether different order.
12731,2001-02,The key to government’s success in accelerating the road development programme lies in its bold policy of levying a cess on petrol and diesel as a user charge for road usage.
12732,2001-02,"Resources for Phase I, to be completed by December 2003, have already been tied up."
12733,2001-02,Work has already been awarded for more than 1500 Kms.
12734,2001-02,The balance portion is expected to be awarded by the middle of this year.
12735,2001-02,"The cess has paved the way for integrated road development in the country, including village roads, district roads, state roads, and national highways."
12736,2001-02,Rs 962 crore from the cess fund is being made available to States for state roads.
12737,2001-02,The total plan outlay for this sector is being enhanced by 93 per cent to Rs 8727 crore in 200102.
12738,2001-02,Another area of success is in the telecommunications sector.
12739,2001-02,"Almost all the policy measures announced in the New Telecom Policy 1999 regarding basic and cellular services, national long distance, Internet services, and corporatisation of Department of Telecom Services have been implemented."
12740,2001-02,Competition is being introduced in all service segments.
12741,2001-02,"By March 2001, overall teledensity is expected to reach 3.5 per hundred, about double the teledensity of only two years ago."
12742,2001-02,"Moreover, the new competition has already reduced prices for consumers."
12743,2001-02,"There are now almost 800,000 STD/ ISD/Local booths around the country bringing telephone service within reach of almost all consumers, apart from generating considerable employment."
12744,2001-02,"Looking ahead, having recognised the imperatives of technological change in this area, the Government proposes to introduce the Convergence Bill to cover telecommunications, information technology, and information and broadcasting sectors in an integrated manner."
12745,2001-02,"Coming to the port sector, I am glad to report that policy initiatives designed to increase private sector participation in ports have also been successfully implemented."
12746,2001-02,"Overall, capacity in Indian major ports is expected to go up to 314 million tonnes this year and further to 376 million tonnes by the end of 20012002, along with substantial capacity addition in minor ports."
12747,2001-02,There is now adequate capacity in major ports.
12748,2001-02,Ships no longer have to wait for berths as was the case before.
12749,2001-02,"Ennore port has already been corporatised and Jawahar Lal Nehru Port in New Mumbai is next, and with experience, other major ports can also be corporatized, enabling them to raise resources in the market."
12750,2001-02,Successful investment is being enabled by the setting of economic tariff levels.
12751,2001-02,"With the formation of the Tariff Authority for Major Ports, these tariffs are being rationalised further on a continuing transparent and fair basis."
12752,2001-02,FINANCIAL SECTOR AND CAPITAL MARKETS 35.
12753,2001-02,A great deal of progress has been made over the last few years in pursuing reforms in the financial sector and capital markets.
12754,2001-02,I propose to continue reform in this sector.
12755,2001-02,The Indian equity market is the oldest in Asia.
12756,2001-02,Since the creation of SEBI much greater transparency as well as automaticity has been introduced in the working of the equity market.
12757,2001-02,The need now is to develop and deepen the debt market.
12758,2001-02,This will be of great benefit to small investors and institutional investors alike.
12759,2001-02,"The infrastructure sector will be enabled to raise long term funds, particularly with the opening of the insurance sector."
12760,2001-02,"In order to further develop a transparent and active debt market in general, and the Government securities market in particular, I propose to take the following measures: A Clearing Corporation will be set up under the active encouragement of the RBI, with State Bank of India as the chief promoter, and is expected to be in place by June 2001."
12761,2001-02,It will also enable settlement of forex transactions.
12762,2001-02,"Trading of Government Securities, through order driven screenbased system will be implemented."
12763,2001-02,An electronic Negotiated Dealing System will be set up by the RBI by June 2001 to facilitate transparent electronic bidding in auctions and dealings in Government securities on a real time basis.
12764,2001-02,"In order to ensure smooth and quick movement of funds, the Electronic Fund Transfer EFT and Real Time Gross Settlement Systems RTGS are being put in place by the Reserve Bank of India within the next year."
12765,2001-02,The old Public Debt Act will be replaced by Government Securities Act.
12766,2001-02,Comprehensive legislation will be introduced on securitization.
12767,2001-02,"I propose to set up a small group comprising the Reserve Bank of India, SEBI, the stock exchanges and Ministry of Finance to monitor and implement these developments so that the debt market becomes active next year."
12768,2001-02,Banking sector reforms have proceeded apace in a phased manner over the past decade.
12769,2001-02,"However, the problem of nonperforming assets with banks has continued."
12770,2001-02,Special attention is being paid to recovery of NPAs:
12771,2001-02,Public Sector Banks have recovered Rs 800 crore of NPAs from 2 lakh accounts in 200001.
12772,2001-02,Net NPAs as percentage of net advances were almost half at 7.4 per cent in 19992000 compared to 14.5 per cent in 199394.
12773,2001-02,I also propose to bring in a legislation that will facilitate foreclosure and enforcement of securities in cases of default in order to enable the intitutions to realise their dues.
12774,2001-02,In the light of new competition in the banking industry it is necessary to strengthen the management of the public sector banks.
12775,2001-02,I propose to provide greater autonomy to bank managements.
12776,2001-02,It is also essential to provide greater independence to bank managements in forming their own recruitment strategy and in implementing it.
12777,2001-02,I therefore propose to abolish the Banking Services Recruitment Boards.
12778,2001-02,"This will be done in association with the Reserve Bank of India by July 31, 2001 or earlier."
12779,2001-02,All future recruitments will be done by banks themselves.
12780,2001-02,Capital Account Liberalisation 4 2 .
12781,2001-02,"Until about 10 years ago, all foreign exchange transactions were tightly controlled by the government and by the RBI."
12782,2001-02,We have progressively loosened these controls and made the current account completely convertible.
12783,2001-02,We have also liberalised the capital account for certain purposes.
12784,2001-02,I propose to take further measures for liberalising the capital account.
12785,2001-02,These are: Indian companies wishing to invest abroad may now invest up to US $50 million on an annual basis through the automatic route without being subject to the three year profitability condition.
12786,2001-02,Companies which have issued ADRs GDRs may henceforth make foreign investments up to 100 per cent of these proceeds; up from the current ceiling of 50 per cent.
12787,2001-02,Companies with proven track record wishing to invest larger amounts may now get a block allocation in advance from the RBI for investments overseas.
12788,2001-02,ADRs GDRs will be provided twoway fungibility.
12789,2001-02,"Converted local shares may be reconverted to ADRs GDRs while being subject to sectoral caps, wherever applicable."
12790,2001-02,Indian companies will now be permitted to list in foreign stock exchanges by sponsoring ADR/GDR issues against block share holding.
12791,2001-02,This facility would have to be offered to all categories of shareholders.
12792,2001-02,The Reserve Bank of India will be issuing these guidelines separately.
12793,2001-02,"Investments by Registered partnership firms and companies providing professional services have not, so far, been permitted to make overseas investments."
12794,2001-02,This ban is now being removed.
12795,2001-02,"Similarly, Indian employees who have the benefit of ESOP schemes in foreign owned companies can now make investments abroad up to US $20,000 annually instead of in a block of 5 years."
12796,2001-02,Progressive liberalization has taken place in the provisions relating to foreign investment.
12797,2001-02,I propose to take the following further measures: Foreign Institutional Investors FIIs can invest in a company under the portfolio investment route up to 24 per cent of the paid up capital of the company.
12798,2001-02,This can be increased to 40 per cent with the approval of the General Body of the shareholders by a special resolution.
12799,2001-02,I propose to increase this limit to 49 per cent.
12800,2001-02,Foreign Direct Investment FDI in NonBanking Financial Companies NBFCs is permitted on a case by case basis upto 100 per cent but with a condition that a minimum of 25 per cent of their holding is divested in the domestic market.
12801,2001-02,"This condition is being removed, provided the foreign investors bring in a minimum of US $50 million."
12802,2001-02,FDI in NBFCs will now be put on the automatic route subject to RBI guidelines.
12803,2001-02,"In order to accelerate growth in the Indian economy, we have now to address some of the difficult areas of reform that have not been tackled so far."
12804,2001-02,There are four significant areas where a price and distribution control regime exists.
12805,2001-02,"These are the areas of petroleum, fertilizer, sugar and drugs."
12806,2001-02,Administered Pricing Mechanism APM Petroleum 47.
12807,2001-02,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, Government had, in November 1997, notified the details of dismantling of the Administered Pricing Mechanism APM in the petroleum sector by March 2002."
12808,2001-02,I propose to adhere to this deadline.
12809,2001-02,"A time bound action programme is being prepared for the deregulation of APM by March, 2002."
12810,2001-02,My colleague the Minister of Petroleum and Natural Gas will be outlining the road map for this separately.
12811,2001-02,Hon’ble Members will recall that I have in the past referred to the rationalisation of fertilizer pricing with the objective of phasing out the existing retention price scheme RPS in the mediumterm.
12812,2001-02,"Government has now decided to implement the recommendations of the Expenditure Reforms Commission for a phased programme of complete decontrol of urea by April 1, 2006."
12813,2001-02,"The following steps would be taken in the first phase commencing from April 1, 2001:"
12814,2001-02,The unit specific RPS will be replaced by a Group Concession Scheme.
12815,2001-02,The current MRP arrangement will be continued and the concession for each group calibrated to enable the units to sell urea at the stipulated MRP.
12816,2001-02,The rate of concession for urea units based on naphtha/FO/LSHS will be linked to international prices of these feed stocks.
12817,2001-02,Government is committed to complete decontrol of sugar.
12818,2001-02,But this must be irreversible.
12819,2001-02,"Government has decided to introduce futures/forward trading in sugar within the coming year, a step that is necessary before full decontrol."
12820,2001-02,"Sugar under the Public Distribution System will continue to be supplied to ration cardholders in the special category states, hill states, island territories and to BPL families in other states and UTs."
12821,2001-02,Such supplies can even continue after sugar is completely decontrolled.
12822,2001-02,The retail issue price of sugar under the PDS is being revised to Rs 13.25 per kg.
12823,2001-02,Drug Price Control 5 0 .
12824,2001-02,The domestic drugs and pharmaceutical industry needs support in order to meet the challenges and to avail of the opportunities arising out of liberalisation of our economy and the impending advent of the product patent regime.
12825,2001-02,Government has been considering measures to lessen the rigours of the present price control mechanism where they have become counter productive.
12826,2001-02,"Towards this end, we have decided that the span of price control will be reduced substantially."
12827,2001-02,"However, keeping in view the interest of the weaker sections of society, Government will retain the power to intervene comprehensively in cases where prices behave abnormally."
12828,2001-02,Changes in the Pharmaceutical Policy are being made accordingly.
12829,2001-02,"Government had constituted a high level committee on law relating to revival, reconstruction and/or winding up of companies."
12830,2001-02,The Committee has submitted its report and Government has accepted its key recommendations.
12831,2001-02,It is proposed to repeal the SICA and also to amend the Companies Act in order to set up a National Company Law Tribunal.
12832,2001-02,"These legislative proposals are proposed to be introduced during the current session by my colleague, the Minister for Law, Justice and Company Affairs."
12833,2001-02,"Along with these changes, it is also necessary to address the contentious issue of rigidities in our labour legislations."
12834,2001-02,Some existing provisions in the Industrial Disputes Act have made it almost impossible for industrial firms to exercise any 12 labour flexibility.
12835,2001-02,The Government is now convinced that some change is necessary in this legislation.
12836,2001-02,"Chapter VB of the ID Act stipulates that employers in specified industrial establishments must obtain prior approval of the appropriate government authority for effecting layoff, retrenchment and closure, after following the prescribed procedure."
12837,2001-02,It is proposed that these provisions may now apply to industrial establishments employing not less than 1000 workers instead of 100.
12838,2001-02,The separation compensation will be increased from 15 days to 45 days for every completed year of service.
12839,2001-02,"The enhancement of compensation would act as a deterrent on employers to take recourse to layoff, retrenchment and closure in a routine manner."
12840,2001-02,"Similarly, rigidities inherent in the existing legislation regarding Contract Labour inhibit growth in employment in many service activities."
12841,2001-02,Section 10 of the existing Act envisages prohibition of contract labour in work/process/operation if the conditions set therein like perennial nature of job etc. are fulfilled.
12842,2001-02,Section 10 enables the contract labour engaged in prohibited jobs to become direct employees of the principal employer.
12843,2001-02,"To overcome this difficulty and at the same time ensure the protection of labour, it is proposed to bring an amendment to facilitate outsourcing of activities without any restrictions as well as to offer contract appointments."
12844,2001-02,"It would not differentiate between core and noncore activities, and provide protection to labour engaged in outsourced activities in terms of their health, safety, welfare, social security, etc."
12845,2001-02,It would also provide for larger compensation based on last drawn wages as retrenchment compensation for every year of service.
12846,2001-02,"These measures will promote industrial investment in labour intensive, and export oriented activities providing for renewed industrial growth, while, at the same time safeguarding the interest of workers."
12847,2001-02,"My colleague, the Minister for Labour will introduce appropriate legislation to amend the Industrial Disputes Act and Contract Labour Act within this session."
12848,2001-02,I am conscious of the shortterm impact on organized labour force of the on going liberalization of the economy.
12849,2001-02,I therefore propose to introduce a new scheme of group insurance viz.
12850,2001-02,The policy will provide compensation of up to 30 per cent of last drawn annual pay for a period of one year to workers who lose their jobs.
12851,2001-02,"It is proposed that the policy will initially cover all employees drawing a salary up to Rs 10,000 per month."
12852,2001-02,The four Government owned general insurance companies will administer this policy on a “No Profit No Loss” basis and will announce full details including premium rates of the proposed policy by the end of June 2001.
12853,2001-02,Small Scale Industries 5 6 .
12854,2001-02,Government’s commitment to the Small Scale sector has been repeatedly demonstrated.
12855,2001-02,"A comprehensive policy package for this sector was announced by the Prime Minister on 30, August, 2000."
12856,2001-02,"In order to encourage production and employment in this sector, the exemption limit has been doubled to Rs 1 crore from September 1, 2000."
12857,2001-02,The new Credit Guarantee Scheme of August 2000 has been provided budgetary support of Rs 100 crore in the current year.
12858,2001-02,The limit of loan without 13 collateral which was earlier fixed at Rs 10 lakh has been raised to Rs 25 lakh under this scheme.
12859,2001-02,Already 7 banks have entered into an agreement with the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust that has been created to implement the scheme.
12860,2001-02,A credit linked capital subsidy scheme for technology upgradation was launched in October 2000 envisaging 12 per cent capital subsidy.
12861,2001-02,It is expected that loans to the extent of Rs 5000 crore would be made available to the SSI sector over the next 5 years under the scheme.
12862,2001-02,Our smallscale entrepreneurs have proved their competitiveness in providing over 35 per cent of national exports.
12863,2001-02,"To enable further new investment and technology upgradation in some of the key export oriented sectors, it is now proposed to dereserve another 14 items related to leather goods, shoes and toys."
12864,2001-02,The Government has recently announced a New Textile Policy aimed at preparing industry for the new challenges of global competition.
12865,2001-02,I am happy to announce a textile package comprising the following schemes: A scheme for setting up Integrated Apparel Parks is being initiated.
12866,2001-02,This will enable the dereserved readymade garment industry to set up modern units with the best infrastructure.
12867,2001-02,A budget provision of Rs 10 crore has been provided for the year 200102.
12868,2001-02,A strong and modern weaving sector is very critical for this purpose.
12869,2001-02,"At least 50,000 new shuttleless looms and the modernisation of 2.5 lakh plain looms to automatic looms is expected to take place by 2004 through funding from the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme TUFS."
12870,2001-02,The budget provision under TUFS is being raised from Rs 50 crore this year to Rs 200 crore in the next year.
12871,2001-02,The Cotton Technology Mission is being continued and strengthened.
12872,2001-02,The budget provision is being increased from Rs 15 crore to Rs 25 crore.
12873,2001-02,The budget allocation for Ministry of Textiles is being enhanced substantially from Rs 457 crore in 200001 to Rs 650 crore in 2001 02.
12874,2001-02,I shall provide the details of the proposed fiscal changes in Part B of my speech.
12875,2001-02,HUMAN DEVELOPMENT Health and Family Welfare 61.
12876,2001-02,"Recognizing the need for increasing investments in social sectors, the Plan allocation for the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare has been stepped up from Rs 4920 crore to Rs 5780 crore."
12877,2001-02,This includes an allocation of Rs 180 crore for HIV/ Aids Control Programme.
12878,2001-02,Indian System of Medicine 62.
12879,2001-02,There is now a great interest worldwide in herbal products as people look for gentler forms of treatment devoid of side effects.
12880,2001-02,We are establishing a Traditional Knowledge Digital Liberary to bring the knowledge already in the public domain in 14 international languages to prevent the grant of patents.
12881,2001-02,We are also introducing a new scheme for strengthening the State Drug Testing Laboratories and pharmacies.
12882,2001-02,We propose to provide Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy benefits similar to the pharmaceutical industry.
12883,2001-02,An integrated National Education Programme – the Sarva Siksha Abhiyan has been launched for universalising elementary education and a National Mission constituted with the Prime Minister as Chairman.
12884,2001-02,"The programme aims to provide eight years of quality elementary education for all children upto the age of 14 years in a Mission mode with a thrust on community ownership, disadvantaged group and girls’ quality education and alternative modes of education."
12885,2001-02,"All existing schemes on elementary education will converge with this scheme after the Ninth Plan and it will cover all districts in the country by March, next year."
12886,2001-02,We are determined to maintain and strengthen our competitiveness in the field of technology education.
12887,2001-02,"A task force set up for this purpose under the HRD Minister has made wide ranging recommendations to upgrade and expand this area of education, The Roorkee Engineering College will be upgraded in to an IIT and funding for IIT, Guwahati has been stepped up to ensure its early completion."
12888,2001-02,"The base of IITs is to be expanded, regional engineering colleges are to be strengthened and new institutes will be set up with public private partnership."
12889,2001-02,The role of the private sector will be encouraged.
12890,2001-02,A new Centrally Sponsored Scheme for computer literacy and studies in schools is being launched and other initiatives planned for encouraging IT education from school to college levels.
12891,2001-02,"Last year, I announced the availability of 100 per cent deduction from income tax of payments made to institutions for vocational education and training by the private sector set up in rural areas and small towns."
12892,2001-02,I propose to make the same deduction available for payments to engineering institutions also.
12893,2001-02,Educational Loans for Students 66.
12894,2001-02,"Mr Speaker Sir, I have personally experienced poverty and faced problems in pursuing higher studies."
12895,2001-02,"I, therefore, feel that no deserving student in the country should be deprived of higher and technical education for want of finances."
12896,2001-02,"I am glad that the Indian Banks Association IBA has formulated a new comprehensive Educational Loan Scheme, which will cover all courses in schools and colleges in India and abroad."
12897,2001-02,"Loans will be available under this scheme up to Rs 7.5 lakh for studies in India, and Rs 15 lakh for studies abroad."
12898,2001-02,"No collateral or margin will be stipulated for loans up to Rs 4 lakh, the interest of which will not exceed the prime lending rate PLR."
12899,2001-02,The interest rate will not exceed PLR plus 1 per cent for loans above Rs 4 lakh.
12900,2001-02,The loans would be repaid over a period of 5 to 7 years with provision of a grace period.
12901,2001-02,I hope that this scheme will enable needy children to pursue higher and technical studies both inside and outside India.
12902,2001-02,The year 2001 is being observed as Women’s Empowerment Year.
12903,2001-02,"My colleague, the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission is heading a Task Force to review the programmes for women."
12904,2001-02,Meanwhile I propose to: 15 Strengthen the Rashtriya Mahila Kosh for providing micro credit to poor assetless women through NGOs.
12905,2001-02,Launch an integrated scheme for women’s empowerment in 650 blocks through women’s self help groups.
12906,2001-02,"Start a new scheme for women in difficult circumstances like widows of Vrindavan, Kashi and other places, destitute women and other disadvantaged women groups."
12907,2001-02,Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 68.
12908,2001-02,"In keeping with Government’s commitment to improve the Welfare of the scheduled tribes, a separate National Scheduled Tribes Finance & Development Corporation with an authorised share capital of Rs 500 crore has been set up."
12909,2001-02,The allocation for the schemes for welfare of scheduled tribes in the Ministry of Tribal Affairs has been enhanced from Rs 786 crore this year to Rs 986 crore in the coming year.
12910,2001-02,"Similarly, the allocation for the schemes for welfare and upliftment of scheduled castes in the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment has been enhanced from Rs 709 crore this year to Rs 790 crore in the coming year."
12911,2001-02,"Hon’ble Members may recall my announcement in the last budget, of a new Group Insurance Scheme, the “Janashree Bima Yojana” to extend Social Security cover to the poorest sections of society."
12912,2001-02,"The said scheme was launched by the Prime Minister on 10, August, 2000 and has been well received."
12913,2001-02,I believe that the Social Security cover needs to be widened to minimize the miseries of our people below the poverty line.
12914,2001-02,"Accordingly, I propose to introduce two more schemes during the next financial year:"
12915,2001-02,"In the case of beneficiaries who join the scheme at a young age, some periodical payments at the end of every ten years are also envisaged."
12916,2001-02,The beneficiaries will be required to make a small contribution towards the premium.
12917,2001-02,"A Shiksha Sahyog Yojana, to provide an education allowance of Rs 100 per month to the children of parents living below the poverty line, to meet the expenses of education during their studies from 9th to 12th standard, so that a needy student is not deprived of the opportunity to continue his/her education for want of funds."
12918,2001-02,This will be available to subscribers of the Janashree Bima Yojana.
12919,2001-02,These schemes will be managed by LIC.
12920,2001-02,"Meanwhile, I have some good news for workers."
12921,2001-02,"The wage ceiling for coverage under the EPF and MP Act, 1952 has been enhanced from Rs 5000 to Rs 6500."
12922,2001-02,The extra expenditure on this account is estimated to be Rs 77 crore per annum.
12923,2001-02,"Whereas the organised sector is at present covered by various pension, provident fund and gratuity schemes, the unorganised sector does not have adequate social security coverage."
12924,2001-02,"I am asking the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority to look into all these issues and provide a road map for pension reforms by October 1, 2001."
12925,2001-02,Journalists Welfare Fund 7 4 .
12926,2001-02,Journalists have to increasingly take greater risks in covering terrorist and other violence prone incidents.
12927,2001-02,"As an acknowledgement of their services and sacrifices, and with the expectation of a better treatment at their hands, I propose to set up a Journalists Welfare Fund with a contribution of Rs 1 crore under the grants of Ministry of I&B."
12928,2001-02,My colleague the I&B Minister will announce the details of the scheme.
12929,2001-02,"Our entertainment industry, particularly the film industry not only provides the much needed fantasy to millions of our people who live in an otherwise harsh and cruel world, it has also emerged as an important segment of our economy and holds great promise for the future."
12930,2001-02,"Two years ago, I provided for this industry the same tax exemption that was available for merchandise exports."
12931,2001-02,"A few months ago, the Government issued a notification under the IDBI Act whereby entertainment industry including films has been declared as an industrial concern."
12932,2001-02,Banks are in the process of finalising guidelines for financing such projects that are bankable.
12933,2001-02,"I hope that the film industry will take full advantage of these measures to bring about a greater degree of professionalism and transparency in its operations, and will not do things chupke chupke and certainly not chori chori."
12934,2001-02,As I have already stated the most serious problem confronting the economy is the poor state of the fiscal health of both the Central and State Governments.
12935,2001-02,The combined fiscal deficit of the two together is in the region of 10 per cent of GDP.
12936,2001-02,I have often been described as a fiscal fundamentalist.
12937,2001-02,Some have gone to the extent of calling me a fiscal terrorist.
12938,2001-02,Why am I so concerned about the fiscal deficit?
12939,2001-02,Let me try to explain.
12940,2001-02,"The total receipts of the Central Government in the current year according to BE are about Rs 281,000 crore."
12941,2001-02,"Of this amount, Rs 72,000 crore is States’ share of the Central taxes and grants."
12942,2001-02,"The Central Government is, therefore, left with Rs 209,000 crore."
12943,2001-02,"On the expenditure side, about Rs 101,000 crore was to be spent on interest, Rs 59,000 crore on defence, Rs 23,000 crore on major subsidies and Rs 16,000 crore on pensions."
12944,2001-02,"The net amount left for meeting all other Government expenditure totalling Rs 123,000 crore was, therefore, only Rs 12,000 crore."
12945,2001-02,"I have, therefore, to borrow Rs 111,000 crore in the current year to make both ends meet."
12946,2001-02,"The most worrisome aspect is that over 70 per cent of my borrowing, i.e., Rs 77,000 crore was for financing unproductive revenue expenditure."
12947,2001-02,This will add 17 to my interest burden next year forcing me to borrow more and ultimately fall into a debt trap.
12948,2001-02,"I am deeply conscious of the burden which is being placed on future generations, by our extravagance."
12949,2001-02,I cannot allow this situation to continue.
12950,2001-02,"As promised in my earlier Budget Speeches, I appointed the Expenditure Reforms Commission last year and introduced the Fiscal Responsibility Bill in this House in the last session."
12951,2001-02,The bill seeks to reduce the fiscal deficit to 2 per cent and completely eliminate the revenue deficit over the next five years.
12952,2001-02,"A number of initiatives have already been taken to contain, in particular, the growth of nonplan expenditure."
12953,2001-02,I have not allowed any increase in nonplan expenditure this year.
12954,2001-02,"Consequently, for the first time in many years, the fiscal deficit target fixed in the budget has indeed been achieved, and remains at 5.1 per cent in the RE of the current year."
12955,2001-02,The target of 3.6 per cent revenue deficit has also been achieved.
12956,2001-02,I intend to carry forward the process of bringing about structural changes in the composition of Central Government expenditure and effect economy in non plan revenue expenditure with greater vigour while improving the quality of plan expenditure.
12957,2001-02,"For this, I propose to take the following initiatives: User charges for services provided by government and its agencies will be revised keeping in view the increased cost of these services."
12958,2001-02,A portion of this increase will be provided to enhance the maintenance and quality of these services.
12959,2001-02,"Similarly, postal rates will be revised moderately to contain the rising postal deficit."
12960,2001-02,All requirements of recruitment will be scrutinized to ensure that fresh recruitment is limited to 1 per cent of total civilian staff strength.
12961,2001-02,"As about 3 per cent of staff retire every year, this will reduce the manpower by 2 per cent per annum, achieving a reduction of10 per cent in five years as announced by the Prime Minister."
12962,2001-02,The Surplus Pool under the Department of Personnel will be streamlined and equipped to redeploy and retrain surplus staff.
12963,2001-02,Employees in the Surplus Pool will also be offered an attractive VRS package.
12964,2001-02,"Standard licence fee rent on government accommodation will be enhanced by 50 per cent for Group A, 25 per cent for Group B and 15 per cent for other categories of staff with effect from April 1, 2001."
12965,2001-02,Facility of LTC to Central Government employees will be suspended for 2 years for the remaining part of the fouryear block period except for employees who are entitled to last LTC before retirement.
12966,2001-02,Use of Information Technology in government activities with large public interface will be maximized to promote efficiency.
12967,2001-02,"For this purpose, operations like GPF, pension, pay and accounts offices, passports, income tax, customs, central excise, will be fully computerized by March 31, 2002."
12968,2001-02,Public sector banks and insurance companies are also being asked to complete computerization of their operations within this period.
12969,2001-02,"The Expenditure Reforms Commission, which was set up last year, has presented reports concerning downsizing in 6 Ministries and Departments."
12970,2001-02,"These include Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Ministry of Coal, Department of Heavy Industry, Department of Public Enterprises and Ministry of Small Scale Industries."
12971,2001-02,Reports of the Commission concerning other Departments will also be received within the next six months.
12972,2001-02,"These recommendations will be implemented by July 31, 2001 and identified surplus staff transferred to the Surplus Pool."
12973,2001-02,"Charity, it is said, must begin at home."
12974,2001-02,"I believe austerity, too, must begin at home."
12975,2001-02,"To lead by example, based on the recommendations of the Expenditure Reforms Commission, I propose to abolish three secretary/special secretary level and two joint secretary level posts in the Department of Economic Affairs."
12976,2001-02,"This will be done in stages by 31, July."
12977,2001-02,"In addition, another 44 posts of directors and below will be abolished, as against 31 recommended by the ERC. 1675 posts are being abolished in the Currency and Coinage Division which will be restructured and corporatised."
12978,2001-02,The National Savings Organisation is to be downsized from a level of 1191 staff to about 25.
12979,2001-02,I have asked ERC to provide their recommendations in respect of the Departments of Revenue and Expenditure also.
12980,2001-02,I am confident that this will expedite the process of right sizing the establishments in all the Ministries/ Departments of Government.
12981,2001-02,The Planning Commission has commenced the task of preparing the Tenth Plan.
12982,2001-02,"Given the severity of resource constraints, improvement in the quality of government spending is of the essence."
12983,2001-02,"It has therefore been decided to subject all existing schemes, both at the Central and State levels, to zero based budgeting and to retain only those that are demonstrably efficient and essential."
12984,2001-02,"Furthermore, all schemes that are similar in nature will be converged to eliminate duplication."
12985,2001-02,Centrally sponsored schemes that can be transferred to States will be identified.
12986,2001-02,Resource flows will be linked to performance.
12987,2001-02,Necessary procedural changes will also be made to speed up the decision making process for approval of schemes.
12988,2001-02,Utmost importance will be given to decentralized planning.
12989,2001-02,"The Central Government pension liability has reached unsustainable proportions: as a percentage of GDP, it has risen from about 0.5 per cent in 199394 to 1 per cent in 20002001."
12990,2001-02,"As such it is envisaged that those who enter central government services after October 1, 2001 would receive pension through a new pension programme based on defined contributions."
12991,2001-02,"In order to review the existing pension system and to provide a roadmap for the next steps to be taken by the Government, I propose to constitute a High Level Expert Group, which would give its recommendations within 3 months."
12992,2001-02,I have drawn your attention to the increasing share of debt service burden in the expenditure budget caused by rising government debt and exacerbated by the prevalence of high real interest rates.
12993,2001-02,Most interest rates in the economy are now market determined.
12994,2001-02,"But, their movement downward is constrained by the rigidities 19 inherent in the administered interest rates governing the contractual saving sphere i.e. Provident Fund and Small Savings Schemes."
12995,2001-02,I have examined this issue very carefully.
12996,2001-02,I find that the interest rates provided in all these schemes seldom exceeded consumer price inflation by more than 3 per cent between 1980 and 1998.
12997,2001-02,"Since then, this difference has risen to 6 to 8 per cent."
12998,2001-02,Not only are such high real interest rates putting an unsustainable burden on both Central and State Governments but the resulting high cost of capital is also inhibiting economic growth all round.
12999,2001-02,"I am therefore reducing most administered rates by 1.5 per cent as of March 1, 2001."
13000,2001-02,Government guarantee and tax incentives for these schemes will continue.
13001,2001-02,"For the future, I propose to explore a better system for the determination of these rates."
13002,2001-02,I propose to appoint an Expert Committee to provide recommendations on this issue.
13003,2001-02,The benefit of reduction in interest rates on Small Savings Deposits will be fully passed on to the States.
13004,2001-02,This will reduce their borrowing cost from Small Savings by 100 to 150 basis points.
13005,2001-02,"In addition, I am also reducing the interest rate on loans portion of Central assistance to State Plans by 50 basis points."
13006,2001-02,Alignment of interest rates on GPF by the State Governments along with the reduced provident funds interest rates at the Centre will further reduce the interest burden of State Governments.
13007,2001-02,"Moreover, because of the anticipated increase in gross tax collection of the Centre, devolution of central taxes to States is expected to increase by over Rs 9000 crore in 200102 over the current year."
13008,2001-02,All these measures will help in reducing the debt burden of the States and improve their fiscal position.
13009,2001-02,"Along with fiscal consolidation at the Centre, it will be our endeavour to work jointly with the States to reform their finances."
13010,2001-02,"Pursuant to the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission, an Incentive Fund of Rs 10,607 crore has been earmarked for the next 5 years to encourage States to implement monitorable fiscal reforms."
13011,2001-02,These reforms will essentially be the States’ own programmes and considerable flexibility has been provided for individual States to design their programmes.
13012,2001-02,"In the fiscal year 200102, I have provided an amount of Rs 4243 crore towards this Incentive Fund."
13013,2001-02,PUBLIC SECTOR RESTRUCTURING AND PRIVATIZATION87.
13014,2001-02,Our public sector has expanded in almost every area of economic activity.
13015,2001-02,"In many ways, it has served the nation well; capability has been developed all round and a strong industrial base built up."
13016,2001-02,These enterprises must now be strengthened to compete and prosper in the new environment.
13017,2001-02,Last year I had defined government’s policy in this regard clearly.
13018,2001-02,Financial and business restructuring plans of a number of PSUs including SAIL and HMT have been approved.
13019,2001-02,"Since 1998 financial restructuring support to viable and potentially viable PSUs amounting to more than Rs 13,000 crore has been provided to 23 PSUs."
13020,2001-02,Government has also decided to close down 8 nonviable PSUs during the current year.
13021,2001-02,A package of measures for revival and closure of the various mills of National Textiles Corporation has also been approved.
13022,2001-02,The procedure for privatization of public sector enterprises has now been considerably streamlined.
13023,2001-02,The Department of Disinvestment has been set up to 20 accelerate the privatization process.
13024,2001-02,"To maximise returns to government, our approach has shifted from the disinvestment of small lots of shares to strategic sales of blocks of shares to strategic investors."
13025,2001-02,The Government has already approved privatization of 27 companies in which the process of disinvestment is expected to be completed during the course of the year.
13026,2001-02,"These companies include among others VSNL, Air India, and Maruti Udyog Limited."
13027,2001-02,"Given the advanced stage of the process of disinvestment in many of these companies, I am emboldened to take credit for a receipt of Rs 12000 crore from disinvestment during the next year."
13028,2001-02,"An amount of Rs 7000 crore out of this will be used for providing restructuring assistance to PSUs, safety net to workers and reduction of debt burden."
13029,2001-02,A sum of Rs 5000 crore will be used to provide additional budgetary support for the Plan primarily in the social and infrastructure sectors.
13030,2001-02,This additional allocation for the plan will be contingent upon realization of the anticipated receipts.
13031,2001-02,In consultation with Planning Commission I shall come up with sectoral allocation proposals during the course of the year.
13032,2001-02,The earthquake in Gujarat has been a terrible and unprecedented tragedy in terms of loss of life and damage to property.
13033,2001-02,"Although I am confident that the inherent resilience and entrepreneurial spirit so characteristic of the people of Gujarat will result in quick restoration of economic activity, I would like to assure the House that we have the capacity to fully meet the challenges of such natural calamities without deflecting from our path of pursuing our economic goals."
13034,2001-02,"To enable the State Government to deal with the situation, Government of India is extending the following assistance:"
13035,2001-02,Rs 500 crore was made available to the State immediately from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.
13036,2001-02,"The National Calamity Contingency Fund, set up with initial corpus of Rs 500 crore as a result of the Eleventh Finance Commission recommendations, is being augmented by the imposition of a 2 per cent surcharge on personal income tax and corporate tax."
13037,2001-02,"Assistance will be provided to the State Government under various Centrally Sponsored Schemes for reconstruction of roads, bridges, power installations, school buildings, public utilities and other public infrastructure."
13038,2001-02,Arrangements have been tied up with the World Bank and Asian Development Bank for obtaining a line of credit of US $ 800 million.
13039,2001-02,A joint team has already visited Gujarat and substantial additional funds are expected to be negotiated.
13040,2001-02,RBI has instructed banks to make special arrangements for freezing of recoveries and extension of new loans on a liberal terms for borrowers in the affected areas.
13041,2001-02,The National Housing Bank and HUDCO have set apart adequate funds for housing reconstruction.
13042,2001-02,I also propose to allocate a special quota of tax free bonds of the order of Rs 2000 crore between the two institutions.
13043,2001-02,"As was done after the Orissa cyclone, cement and steel used for construction in the Indira Awas Yojana, by HUDCO and by agencies identified by the State Government, would be exempt from excise duty."
13044,2001-02,The Government of Gujarat will be enabled to raise funds by floating tax free earthquake relief bonds which will be open to subscription in Rupees to individuals and others including NonResident Indians through the Reserve Bank of India.
13045,2001-02,All goods intended for relief have been exempted from excise and customs duties; direct tax assessees have been given extension of time for filing their returns.
13046,2001-02,A natural calamity of this magnitude has also highlighted the need to set up permanent institutional arrangements for management of national disasters.
13047,2001-02,The National Committee on Disaster Management under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister will be making recommendations for laying down effective long term strategy for this purpose.
13048,2001-02,BUDGET ESTIMATESRevised Estimates for 20002001 94.
13049,2001-02,"We have been able to adhere to the Budget target of fiscal deficit despite pressures on public finances on account of deceleration in disinvestment programme, natural calamities and the relief to consumers of petroleum products."
13050,2001-02,"The revised estimates for the current fiscal year show a marginal decrease in expenditure of Rs 2,965 crore as compared to the Budget estimates."
13051,2001-02,"Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated to be Rs 1,44,403 crore compared to the Budget estimates of Rs 1,46,209 crore, thereby reflecting a shortfall of Rs 1806 crore."
13052,2001-02,The shortfall is mainly due to lower collection of Customs and Union Excise duties which were reduced to provide relief to POL consumers.
13053,2001-02,"Non tax revenue is estimated at Rs 61,763 crore, Rs 4299 crore more than the estimated level of Rs 57,464 crore."
13054,2001-02,"However, disinvestment receipts are expected to be lower at Rs 2500 crore against the Budget target of Rs 10,000 crore."
13055,2001-02,The fiscal deficit as a percentage of the GDP is expected to be on target at 5.1 per cent.
13056,2001-02,Budget Estimates for 20012002 9 7 .
13057,2001-02,"In the budget estimates for 20012002, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 3,75,223 crore, of which Rs 100,100 crore is for plan and Rs 275,123 crore for nonplan."
13058,2001-02,"The budget support for Central, State and UT Plans has been placed at Rs 100,100 crore, an increase of Rs 13,862 crore over revised estimates 20002001."
13059,2001-02,This amounts to an increase of 16 per cent.
13060,2001-02,"Gross budgetary support for the Central Plan is being enhanced from Rs 48,269 crore in the revised estimates 20002001 to Rs 59,456 crore in 20012002."
13061,2001-02,"Central Plan assistance to States and Union Territories in 20012002 is also proposed to be increased to Rs 40,644 crore from Rs 37,969 crore in the revised estimates 20002001."
13062,2001-02,"Nonplan expenditure in 20012002 is estimated to be Rs 2,75,123 crore compared to Rs 2,49,284 crore in Revised estimates for 20002001."
13063,2001-02,"The increase in nonplan expenditure is mainly in interest payments Rs 11,633 crores, defence Rs 7,539 crore and Grants to State Governments Rs 2,221 crore."
13064,2001-02,"In order to practice greater accountability and transparency, I am attaching with the budget papers this year a new report on “Implementation of Budget Announcements, 19992000 and 200001”."
13065,2001-02,"Sir, I now present my tax proposals, indirect taxes first."
13066,2001-02,"In my earlier budgets, I have endeavoured to ensure a continuity of approach in framing my revenue proposals."
13067,2001-02,"The principles that have guided me have been the need for growth in revenues, simplification and rationalization of the tax regime, and effective tax compliance through measures, which are friendly for the honest taxpayer, and a deterrent to the evader."
13068,2001-02,"I have reduced the number of rates in both customs and excise duties, simplified procedures and introduced measures to improve tax compliance."
13069,2001-02,I have given up my discretionary power to grant excise and customs duty exemptions in individual cases thus saving hundreds of crore of revenue for Government.
13070,2001-02,The policy of penalties against tax evaders has also been made non discretionary.
13071,2001-02,With all these steps I have sought to put an end to a system that pressure groups or lobbies could influence.
13072,2001-02,My attempt this year is to take this process to its logical conclusion.
13073,2001-02,"In my last budget, I had introduced the rate of 16% as the rate of Central Value Added Tax CENVAT."
13074,2001-02,"I had also rationalized the rates of special excise duty to three, namely, 8%, 16% and 24%."
13075,2001-02,The single rate of CENVAT now contributes about 68% of the total excise revenues from ad valorem duties.
13076,2001-02,I now propose to reduce the three rates of special excise duty to a single rate of 16%.
13077,2001-02,"As a consequence, I propose to abolish the 8% special excise duty on the following items: 1 Glazed tiles 2 Mattresses and articles of bedding 3 Carpets and floor coverings 4 Painted canvas, studio back cloth, etc 5 Linoleum and textile wall coverings etc. 6 Scooters and motorcycles, and 7 Taxis These items will now be charged to CENVAT only at the rate of 16%."
13078,2001-02,"White cement and other special cements, yachts and pleasure boats, arms and ammunition for private use and articles of fur skins, will attract SED of 16% and a total duty of 32%."
13079,2001-02,"The special excise duty on aerated soft drinks, soft drink concentrates supplied to vending machines, and motorcars will be reduced to 16%, thus putting an end to the rate of 24% special excise duty."
13080,2001-02,These items also will now bear a total duty of 32%.
13081,2001-02,"There will be no change in respect of products, which already attract this rate of 32%."
13082,2001-02,"There are a few items that currently attract CENVAT at half the rate, namely, 8%."
13083,2001-02,"All these items will henceforth be charged to the normal rate of 16% except cotton yarn including sewing thread, LPG, kerosene and diesel engines up to 10 HP, which I am leaving at 8% for the present in the larger public interest."
13084,2001-02,After these rationalization measures about 80% of the revenue in respect of ad valorem duties will come from the single rate of 16% and about 17% from the combined rate of 32%.
13085,2001-02,India is the world’s second largest producer of fruits and vegetables.
13086,2001-02,"However, most of these are wasted in the absence of proper storage and processing facilities."
13087,2001-02,Foodprocessing industry dealing in perishable fruits and vegetables needs special support.
13088,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose to exempt food preparations based on fruits and vegetables completely from excise duty."
13089,2001-02,"This will include a very wide range of products of common use like pickles, sauces, ketchup and juices, etc."
13090,2001-02,"This, along with the support I have given to creation of better storage facilities will give a fillip to the food processing industry and will go a long way in improving the rural economy of our country."
13091,2001-02,The Eleventh Finance Commission has recommended a special levy for the replenishment of the National Calamity Contingency Fund.
13092,2001-02,"As an ad hoc measure, this was provided for in the current year through a special surcharge on corporate taxes."
13093,2001-02,I propose to establish this funding on a regular basis through a special surcharge of excise on a range of products the use of which should be discouraged on health grounds.
13094,2001-02,I propose to levy a surcharge of 15% on cigarettes.
13095,2001-02,The duty on biris would increase from Rs 6 to Rs 7 per thousand biris.
13096,2001-02,The total duty on pan masala would be 55%/60%.
13097,2001-02,Miscellaneous tobacco products like chewing tobacco would be charged to a total duty of 60%.
13098,2001-02,Excise duty on High Speed Diesel was reduced from 16% to 12% in September last year.
13099,2001-02,I propose to restore it to the normal CENVAT rate of 16%.
13100,2001-02,I also propose to restore special excise duty on motor spirit to the previous rate of 16%.
13101,2001-02,The burden of increase in duty is not proposed to be passed on to the consumers except for any technical corrections.
13102,2001-02,LPG is charged to excise duty at 8%.
13103,2001-02,"I propose to apply the same rate of duty to Compressed Natural Gas, which is exempt at present."
13104,2001-02,A special scheme of charging excise duty from independent textile processors on compounding basis was introduced in December 1998.
13105,2001-02,The working of this scheme has resulted in serious distortions.
13106,2001-02,"I have therefore decided to revert to the ad valorem 24 duty structure for independent textile processors with effect from 1, March 2001."
13107,2001-02,Independent processors would be allowed to take CENVAT credit of the duty paid on inputs on a deemed basis.
13108,2001-02,There is no economic logic to continue with excise duty exemption on garments sold under a registered trade name.
13109,2001-02,I propose to impose a duty of 16% on such garments.
13110,2001-02,Products of SSI units are exempt from excise duty up to Rs one crore.
13111,2001-02,This exemption is intended to provide fiscal support to the genuinely small producers.
13112,2001-02,"I propose to withdraw this exemption in respect of the following items, in which misuse of the exemption is more than likely: « «"
13113,2001-02,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the matter of rates of duties of excise I have almost achieved the ultimate with only one basic rate of CENVAT and one rate of special excise duty."
13114,2001-02,The procedures in excise have also been made modern.
13115,2001-02,I can humbly claim that excise duty is now a model of value added tax up to the manufacturing stage.
13116,2001-02,"The only issue, which remains to be tackled now, is the issue of individual exemptions."
13117,2001-02,"The regime of exemptions is incompatible with a simple, equitable and rational tax structure that has now been put in place."
13118,2001-02,"I am not doing away with the exemptions altogether, realizing that this may come as a sudden shock to those who are accustomed to exemptions."
13119,2001-02,"However, I will like to give notice to them to be prepared to pay duties like anyone else."
13120,2001-02,"For the present, I am making a modest beginning by imposing a nominal duty of 4% on some items like goggles, imitation jewellery, rubberized mattresses etc. which in four equal annual installments will be taken to 16%."
13121,2001-02,More and more items will be put on this escalator every year.
13122,2001-02,Structural changes have taken place in the economy with the service sector growing faster than other sectors.
13123,2001-02,I am expanding the net of service tax and I propose to add the following services to the list of taxable services: Specified Banking and Financial Services Authorized Service Stations for servicing of vehicles including two wheelers Port Services Broadcasting Services Cotton yarnBall or roller bearings Arms and ammunition for private use The excise duty structure on matches comprises rates of duty ranging from 25 paise to Rs 2.40 per hundred boxes of 50 sticks each.
13124,2001-02,"I propose to rationalise the existing rates to a more rational structure with a duty rate of 50 paise for the handmade sector, Re.1 for the middle sector, Rs 2 for the semimechanized sector and Rs 3 for the mechanized sector."
13125,2001-02,I now turn to my proposals relating to customs duties.
13126,2001-02,"In my previous budgets, I have reduced the total number of major customs duty rates to four, that is, 35%, 25%, 15% and 5%."
13127,2001-02,I do not wish to propose any further reduction in the number of customs duty rates this year.
13128,2001-02,"However, I propose to discontinue the surcharge of 10%."
13129,2001-02,"With this, peak level of customs duty will decline marginally from 38.5% to 35%."
13130,2001-02,All agricultural produce already attracts the peak rate of duty of 35% or more.
13131,2001-02,"Current tariffs on major cereals are: Wheat 50%, Rice 70%/80% and Maize 50%."
13132,2001-02,"I now propose to increase the customs duty on tea, coffee, copra, and coconut and desiccated coconut from the present 35% to 70%."
13133,2001-02,"Similarly, I propose to increase the rate of duty on crude edible oils ranging from 35% to 55% at present to a uniform rate of 75% and on refined oils from 45%/ 65% to 85%."
13134,2001-02,A lower rate of 45% would apply to soyabean oil on account of WTO binding.
13135,2001-02,I also propose to enhance the rate of customs duty on the import of crude palm oil by vanaspati manufacturers from 25% to 55% and restrict this concession to sick vanaspati units only.
13136,2001-02,The others will pay 75%.
13137,2001-02,I wish to assure the House that in order to safeguard the interest of our farmers we shall move swiftly whenever any perceptible threat on account of imports is noticed.
13138,2001-02,The House is aware that Government has committed itself to abolish customs duty on IT and telecom products and their inputs and components under the ITA 1 Schedule by 2003.
13139,2001-02,"The customs duty on these products is proposed to be reduced to 15% from 1, March 2001 from current levels."
13140,2001-02,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with the abolition of the remaining Quantitative Restrictions in April this year second hand cars will also become freely importable."
13141,2001-02,"To allay the fears of surge in import of second hand cars, the rate of basic customs duty on their • • • • • • • • • • 1 20."
13142,2001-02,The total duty now applicable to second hand cars will be more than 180%.
13143,2001-02,"I propose a similar structure of duty for the import of old multi utility vehicles, scooters and motor cycles."
13144,2001-02,"In order to provide a level playing field for domestic liquor producers, I propose to levy CVD at a suitable rate on imported liquor, taking into account the levies of state excise on domestic production."
13145,2001-02,Our textile industry has to modernize itself and acquire the latest technology in order to face global competition and attain high quality of production.
13146,2001-02,"I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on specified textile machines, including shuttleless looms, from 15% to 5%."
13147,2001-02,"As a measure of further relief to the textile sector, I propose, to reduce the customs duty on silk waste, cotton waste and flax fibre from 35% / 25% to 15%."
13148,2001-02,"There are some cases of anomaly in customs duty between raw materials and intermediate goods on the one hand, and intermediate goods and final products on the other."
13149,2001-02,"DMT, PTA, MEG and Caprolactum are raw materials for production of manmade fibers and yarns."
13150,2001-02,"However, the customs duty on these materials is higher than the rate applicable to fibers and yarn."
13151,2001-02,"I propose to reduce the customs duty on DMT, PTA, MEG and Caprolactum from 25% to 20%, which is the WTO bound rate for synthetic fibers and yarns."
13152,2001-02,"Similarly, soda ash is an input for the production of glassware, detergents etc. and currently attracts the peak customs duty of 35% along with the final products."
13153,2001-02,I propose to reduce it to 20%.
13154,2001-02,I also propose to reduce the customs duty on polyester chips and nylon chips for the manufacture of fibers and yarns from 35% to 25%.
13155,2001-02,"On the same analogy, the customs duty on high quality DBM, seawater magnesia and fused magnesia is being reduced from 25% to 15%."
13156,2001-02,Gems and jewellery have considerable potential for export.
13157,2001-02,I propose to reduce the customs duty on cut and polished coloured gem stones from 35% to 15%.
13158,2001-02,I also propose to reduce the customs duty on specified equipment when imported by training institutes sponsored by the Gem and Jewellery Export Promotion Council from 25% to 15%.
13159,2001-02,The rate of customs duty on rough diamonds would now be 5%.
13160,2001-02,CNG kits and their parts attract low duty at 5%.
13161,2001-02,I propose to extend the same treatment to LPG conversion kits and their parts.
13162,2001-02,LNG is not produced in India.
13163,2001-02,The burden of CVD on the import of LNG adds to the cost of LNG projects.
13164,2001-02,I therefore propose to exempt LNG from CVD.
13165,2001-02,"For the same reason, I also propose to exempt wattle extract from the application of CVD."
13166,2001-02,"I propose to reduce the customs duty on cement, and clinkers from 35% to 25%."
13167,2001-02,I am confident that this reduction would help softening of domestic prices of cement for the benefit of consumers.
13168,2001-02,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, accredited pressmen and cameramen are allowed to import cameras, computers, fax machine etc. up to a value of one lakh rupees for their professional use without payment of customs duty once in five years."
13169,2001-02,"In view of 27 many good photographs they have taken of use, I propose to reduce this long waiting period from five years to two years."
13170,2001-02,"In order to encourage better quality of cinematography I propose to reduce the customs duty on cinematographic cameras, projectors and certain other related equipment used by the film industry from 25% to 15%."
13171,2001-02,In order to discourage smuggling I propose to reduce the duty on gold from Rs 400 per 10 grams to Rs 250 per 10 grams.
13172,2001-02,Several industry associations have pointed out that the CVD on the imported consumer products should also be charged on the basis of maximum retail price; otherwise it does not provide a level playing field.
13173,2001-02,I accept the logic of their argument.
13174,2001-02,The Finance Bill contains the enabling provision to implement this decision.
13175,2001-02,I propose to withdraw the exemption from customs duty on a few items and impose on them a nominal duty of 5%.
13176,2001-02,I have already promised that our customs tariff would be brought down to East Asian levels.
13177,2001-02,I will like to move progressively within three years to reduce the number of rates to the minimum with a peak rate of 20%.
13178,2001-02,The modalities for this will be worked out in time for the next budget.
13179,2001-02,"Sir, a number of steps are also being taken for greater procedural and administrative efficiency."
13180,2001-02,"A new Manual of Procedures and Instructions on Central Excise and Customs would be brought out by 1, September 2001."
13181,2001-02,"The emphasis would be on simplicity, brevity and transparency."
13182,2001-02,I also propose to simplify the central excise rules to make them user friendly.
13183,2001-02,My proposals on the excise side are estimated to result in a revenue gain of Rs 4677 crore in a year.
13184,2001-02,On the customs side my proposals are estimated to result in a revenue loss of Rs 2128 crore.
13185,2001-02,"I would be Rs 1,40,992 crore."

13187,2001-02,"In Direct Taxes, my thruststability of tax rates, widening the tax base, rationalizing and simplifying the tax laws and giving impetus to economic growth."
13188,2001-02,"These efforts have resulted in increasing the direct tax revenue from Rs 46,428 crore in 199899 to an estimated Rs 74,467 crore this year."
13189,2001-02,"In addition, the number of assessees has increased significantly from a little over one crore in March 1998 to 2.3 crore at the beginning of this year."
13190,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose to continue with the same rates this year also."
13191,2001-02,"Cooperative Societies, however, will henceforth pay 30% tax instead of 35%."
13192,2001-02,"While imposing the surcharge of 10 % on corporates and noncorporates in my budget of 19992000, I had promised that this would be a temporary levy."
13193,2001-02,"However, I was constrained to increase the surcharge on noncorporate tax payers at the higher income levels to 15% due to the unexpected expenditure burden of Kargil."
13194,2001-02,I now propose to remove all surcharges payable by corporates and noncorporates except the surcharge of 2 % for relief to quake hit areas of Gujarat.
13195,2001-02,"Individuals having an income of up to Rs 60,000/ will not be subject to this surcharge."
13196,2001-02,"As a welfare measure, Sir, I propose to allow 100% deduction for donations to the National Trust for welfare of persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation and multiple disabilities."
13197,2001-02,"Hon’ble Members are aware that the modified onebysix scheme, which I introduced in the Finance Act, 1998 to identify potential incometax assessees and to bring them into the tax net, has paid rich dividends."
13198,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose to extend the onebysix scheme to all urban areas in the country as defined by the 1991 Census."
13199,2001-02,Changes arising out of the 2001 census will be incorporated subsequently.
13200,2001-02,"Certain companies are not filing their returns of income, presumably on the plea that they are not having any taxable income."
13201,2001-02,These companies go out of fiscal discipline and their financial transactions during the initial years escape scrutiny.
13202,2001-02,"I therefore, propose that all companies should file their returns even if they incur a loss."
13203,2001-02,"Sir, another effective measure of widening the tax base is to further enlarge the scope of deduction of tax at source."
13204,2001-02,"Income tax at source will henceforth be deductible at the rate of 10 % on income by way of commission or brokerage exceeding Rs 2,500/, except on transactions relating to shares and securities."
13205,2001-02,"Winnings from lotteries, crossword puzzles etc. are currently taxed at 40%."

13207,2001-02,Television game shows are very popular these days.
13208,2001-02,I wish the winners well.
13209,2001-02,"At the same time, I propose that income tax at the rate of 30% will be deducted at source from the winnings of these and all similar game shows."
13210,2001-02,"At present, tax is deducted at source on income from interest on time deposits only if such income exceeds Rs 10,000/ in respect of deposits with a Bank or Housing Finance Company and Rs 5,000/ in other cases."
13211,2001-02,These threshold limits have led to the erosion of tax base and underreporting of taxable income due to splitting up of deposits.
13212,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose to lower this limit to Rs 2,500/ in all cases."
13213,2001-02,"With economic liberalization, the pay package of salaried class is undergoing many changes."
13214,2001-02,It is being divided into various components and the forms of perquisites and benefits or amenities provided by the employers are assuming new dimensions.
13215,2001-02,"To align our tax system with the present structure of pay packages, I propose that the value of perquisites, benefits or amenities shall be determined on the basis of their cost to the employer, except in respect of houses and cars where different criteria will be adopted for simplicity."
13216,2001-02,"Sir, I also propose to provide relief to salaried persons in the lower income range having income up to rupees one lakh."
13217,2001-02,"Such persons will get an enhanced tax rebate at the rate of 30% in respect of their eligible investments under section 88 of the Income Tax Act, as against 20% at present."
13218,2001-02,"In the case of Export Oriented Units, and units located in Export Processing Zones, Free Trade Zones and Software Technology Parks 25% of their sales in the domestic market are currently tax exempt."
13219,2001-02,I propose to provide for the taxation of profits from these domestic sales of such units.
13220,2001-02,I.T. Sector continues to do well and should be encouraged to do better.
13221,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose that profits derived by the units located in the software technology parks from the export of “onsite” services will be eligible for deduction like their other export income."
13222,2001-02,Units located outside these zones will also get the benefit of tax exemption on such export earnings.
13223,2001-02,I further propose that the condition relating to transfer of ownership of companies in sections 10A and 10B of the Incometax Act shall not apply in respect of companies in which public are substantially interested.
13224,2001-02,"The income of NABARD, National Housing Bank and Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI was exempted from tax in order to provide fiscal support in the initial years of their functioning."
13225,2001-02,Now these institutions have come of age and are working on commercial lines.
13226,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw the tax exemption available to these institutions."
13227,2001-02,The interest payable on certain External Commercial Borrowings ECBs is currently exempt from tax.
13228,2001-02,"Having regard to the fact that interest received by the lender is taxable in the country of his residence and he would get a credit for any tax paid by him in India, any exemption from tax liability in the host country does not benefit the lender but only results in reducing our tax revenues."
13229,2001-02,"I, therefore, propose that the tax exemption in respect of interest paid on such External Commercial Borrowings will not be available for such borrowings made on or after the first day of June 2001."
13230,2001-02,"Certain interest income up to a limit of Rs 12,000 is deductible at present under section 80L."
13231,2001-02,"In addition, income from Government securities is also deductible up to Rs 3,000."
13232,2001-02,"I propose to reduce the maximum limit of this deduction to Rs 9,000."

13236,2001-02,"Sir, the tax incentives in the form of tax holidays for infrastructure facilities are proposed to be further rationalized and enlarged."
13237,2001-02,"For the core sectors of infrastructure namely, roads, highways, rail system, water treatment and supply, irrigation, sanitation and solid waste management systems, I now propose a ten 30 year tax holiday which may be availed of during the initial twenty years."
13238,2001-02,"In the case of airports, ports, inland ports and waterways, industrial parks and generation and distribution of power, which also become commercially viable only in the long run, a tax holiday of ten years is being proposed to be availed of during the initial fifteen years."

13241,2001-02,"I propose to reintroduce this concession retrospectively for the units commencing their operations on or before 31, March 2003."
13242,2001-02,These concessions will also be extended to internet service providers and broadband networks.
13243,2001-02,"Sir, in addition to the tax holiday proposed for development of infrastructure, tax incentives have also been provided for the investors providing longterm finance or investing in the equity capital of the enterprises engaged in infrastructure facility."
13244,2001-02,"Any income by way of interest, dividends or longterm capital gains from such investments is fully exempt."

13252,2001-02,I now propose to give further tax incentives for the development of these zones.
13253,2001-02,The concessions available for infrastructure by way of a 10year tax holiday will be available to the developers of Special Economic Zones on the same lines as developers of industrial parks.
13254,2001-02,The income of investors making long term investment for the development of SEZs will also be exempt.
13255,2001-02,The storage of food grains and their transportation are our major concern.

13257,2001-02,"Sir, for promoting the industry that provides the cup that cheers, I propose to increase the development allowance available for tea from 20% to 40%."
13258,2001-02,"This additional allowance will be used only for replantation, rejuvenation, and modernization of tea plantations and processing facilities."
13259,2001-02,There has been a longstanding demand from the Shipping Industry that the rate of depreciation available in respect of ships and inland water vessels may be increased.
13260,2001-02,I propose to increase this rate of depreciation to 25%.
13261,2001-02,"To encourage investments in weaving, processing and garment sectors of the textile industry, I propose to allow accelerated depreciation at the rate of 50% on plants and machinery purchased under the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme."

13265,2001-02,"For persons having income from house property, the present deduction of 25 % of annual value for repairs etc. is proposed to be enhanced to 30%."
13266,2001-02,"However, there will be no further deductions, except for the expenditure incurred by way of interest payment on housing loans."
13267,2001-02,I propose to extend the tax incentives allowed by way of deduction or rebate on payments of LIC premium to all insurance companies that have been approved by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority 1 7 6 .
13268,2001-02,The presence of multinational enterprises in India and their ability to allocate profits in different jurisdictions by controlling prices in intragroup transactions has made the issue of transfer pricing a matter of serious concern.
13269,2001-02,I had set up an Expert Group in November 1999 to examine the issues relating to transfer pricing.
13270,2001-02,"Their report has been received, proposing a detailed structure for transfer pricing legislation."
13271,2001-02,Necessary legislative changes are being made in the Finance Bill based on these recommendations.
13272,2001-02,"The foreign telecasting channels will henceforth be taxed in India, on their income computed in accordance with the provisions of the Incometax Act."

13275,2001-02,The Department will also no longer have power to withhold the refund due to an assessee.
13276,2001-02,"Similarly, there will be no requirement to obtain a Tax Clearance Certificate under section 230A from the Assessing Officer before transfer of immovable property."
13277,2001-02,I also propose to remove the discretion presently available in deciding the quantum of penalties.
13278,2001-02,"Henceforth, a fixed amount of penalty will be leviable for most of the defaults."
13279,2001-02,Certain educational and medical institutions are required to be approved for claiming tax exemption.

13285,2001-02,"I could have managed a lesser fiscal deficit but that would have been possible only at the cost of growth, which was unacceptable."
13286,2001-02,This is a budget for carrying forward the second generation of economic reforms.
13287,2001-02,This is a budget for growth.
13288,2001-02,This is a budget for equity with efficiency.
13289,2001-02,This is a budget for a new deal to the people of India in the new millennium.
13290,2001-02,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to this august house."
13291,2002-03,I rise to present the budget for the year 200203.
13292,2002-03,"Despite the hostile economic and security environment, the economy has performed relatively well this year."
13293,2002-03,After irregular monsoons in the previous two years an agricultural recovery was enabled by a relatively well distributed monsoon this year.
13294,2002-03,Economic growth this year is expected to be about 5.4 per cent: higher growth being constrained by the industrial slowdown.
13295,2002-03,"The basic fundamentals of the economy remain strong: inflation has fallen to a record low of 1.1 per cent, foreign exchange reserves have crossed US $50 billion, and our food stocks have risen to almost 60 million tonnes."
13296,2002-03,The fall in petroleum prices has provided further relief to the economy as a whole.
13297,2002-03,While the country is economically secure there are still many challenges facing us.
13298,2002-03,These have been described in detail in the Economic Survey presented to this House on February 26.
13299,2002-03,My effort is to devise a budget strategy to meet these challenges.
13300,2002-03,"The year 2001, the first year of the millennium, was a year of many tragic events."
13301,2002-03,"It started with the Gujarat earthquake on January 26, and ended with the terrorist attack on our Parliament on December 13, punctuated by the September 11 incident in the United States and the October 1 outrage in Srinagar."
13302,2002-03,I salute the brave members of our security forces who defended this Parliament and made the supreme sacrifice.
13303,2002-03,On the economic front too it has been a difficult year.
13304,2002-03,World economic growth is estimated to have slowed down to 2.4 per cent in 2001 after seven consecutive years of higher growth.
13305,2002-03,International terror and the global economic slowdown have been the saddest features of the past year.
13306,2002-03,In my last budget I had laid out a comprehensive agenda of the second generation economic reforms.
13307,2002-03,I had also deepened tax reforms aimed at providing a modern tax regime.
13308,2002-03,My aim this year is to consolidate and implement these policies at all levels.
13309,2002-03,I propose to take this process further at the State level through a strategy of reform linked public funding.
13310,2002-03,"The broad strategy of the budget, therefore, is to: Continue the emphasis on agriculture and food economy reforms."
13311,2002-03,Enhance public and private investment in infrastructure.

13314,2002-03,Provide social security to the poor.
13315,2002-03,Consolidate tax reforms and continue fiscal adjustment at both the Central and State levels.
13316,2002-03,The implementation of the announcements made in the last budget has been closely monitored throughout the year.
13317,2002-03,I started the practice last year to submit to Parliament an Action Taken Report on the previous year’s budget.
13318,2002-03,"Accordingly, I am presenting a detailed ATR on last year’s budget announcements."
13319,2002-03,"Some of the highlights are: deregulation of controls on agricultural commodities; progress towards decontrol of sugar; substantial reduction in the span of price control of drugs; decision to amend existing legislation governing revival and/or winding up of companies, along with abolition of SICA; substantial progress in privatization; progress in the implementation of Expenditure Reforms Commission’s recommendations and announcement of VRS for surplus government employees."
13320,2002-03,"These decisions demonstrate the resolve of this Government to carry forward the process of economic reforms, and to ensure that the benefits reach the common man."
13321,2002-03,This will require improved implementation and governance.
13322,2002-03,We shall put in place measures to effect improvement in these areas with the objective of eliminating poverty and improving the quality of life of our citizens.
13323,2002-03,AGRICULTURE AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT Deregulation 9.
13324,2002-03,"Having achieved great success with the Green Revolution and then the White Revolution, the country is now ready for its third revolution of agricultural diversification and food processing."
13325,2002-03,"This requires policy changes, a renewed thrust on agricultural research and extension, and a new climate that encourages much greater investment in both the public and private sectors."
13326,2002-03,Removal of the remaining regulatory and procedural rigidities that still exist and improved rural infrastructure is essential for this new revolution.
13327,2002-03,"Freedom to the farmer, Kisan Ki Azaadi is the overarching goal of our policy."
13328,2002-03,"Even though agriculture is a State subject, there are a number of Central Government policies that influence this sector."
13329,2002-03,"The Government has reviewed the operation of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955."
13330,2002-03,"Restrictive orders inhibiting 3 storage, selling and movement of food and agricultural products are being removed."
13331,2002-03,We can now look forward to a countrywide integrated market for agricultural products.
13332,2002-03,"To continue this initiative, I am proposing further decontrol and deregulation of agriculture along the following lines: Amendment of the Milk and Milk Products Control Order MMPO to remove restrictions on new milk processing capacity, while continuing to regulate health and safety conditions."
13333,2002-03,Removal of small scale industry reservations related to various agricultural equipment items.
13334,2002-03,Decanalization of the export of agricultural commodities and phasing out of remaining export controls.
13335,2002-03,Expansion of futures and forward trading to cover all agricultural commodities.
13336,2002-03,"A multiplicity of regulations for food standards under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, the Food Products Order, the Meat Products Order, the Bureau of Industrial Standards and the MMPO, affect the food and food processing sectors."
13337,2002-03,They need to be modernised and converged.
13338,2002-03,The Prime Minister has decided to set up a Group of Ministers GOM to propose legislative and other changes for preparing a modern integrated food law and related regulations.
13339,2002-03,This process of providing freedom to the farmers now needs to be carried forward by State Governments.
13340,2002-03,Amendment of the Agricultural Produce Marketing Acts to enable farmers to sell directly to potential processors would help them to receive better prices and to access potential new markets.
13341,2002-03,"In addition, the remaining State control orders which are acting as barriers to interState trade need to be lifted."
13342,2002-03,I am proposing that additional allocations in respect of centrally sponsored schemes would be linked to decontrol and deregulation of the agricultural sector by the States.
13343,2002-03,"In 200001, I had announced a Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme for construction of cold storages."
13344,2002-03,"I am happy to report that sanction has already been given for the creation of 21 lakh tonnes capacity in cold storages, much higher than the target of 12 lakh tonnes."
13345,2002-03,The rural godown scheme announced last year has also become operational.
13346,2002-03,With the removal of various control orders much greater investment would be forthcoming under both these schemes.
13347,2002-03,"Accordingly, I propose to allocate Rs 70 crore to each of these subsidy linked credit schemes in 200203."
13348,2002-03,As Finance Minister I feel particularly responsible for the flow of adequate credit to the agriculture sector.
13349,2002-03,"I am glad to report that the total credit flow to the agriculture sector through institutional channels is expected to reach the targeted level of Rs 64,000 crore this year."
13350,2002-03,"It is expected to increase to Rs 75,000 crore in 20022003."
13351,2002-03,"I propose the following steps to further improve the delivery of agricultural credit: The funds for RIDF VIII will be enhanced from Rs 5000 crore to Rs 5500 crore next year, while the rate of interest will be reduced from 4 10.5 per cent to 8.5 per cent."
13352,2002-03,Henceforth it will be fixed at the prevailing bank rate plus 2 per cent.
13353,2002-03,Assistance to the States from RIDF will be linked to reforms in the agriculture and rural sectors.
13354,2002-03,"Kisan Credit Cards introduced in 199899, have been a resounding success and have helped our farmers considerably in their access to agricultural credit."
13355,2002-03,"An additional 63 lakh KCCs have been issued upto December 31, 2001 taking the total to 2.07 crore."
13356,2002-03,The personal insurance package linked to KCCs has also been operationalised.
13357,2002-03,"Similarly, the scheme of micro credit through Self Help Groups is progressing well."
13358,2002-03,"The target of one lakh additional selfhelp groups during the current year is expected to be achieved taking the total so far to more than 3.5 lakh covering more than 70 lakh families, making it the largest micro credit programme in the world."
13359,2002-03,I am raising the target to 1.25 lakh for 200203.
13360,2002-03,"A onetime settlement scheme for small loan accounts with outstanding principal balance upto Rs 25,000 as on March 31, 1998 is already in operation."
13361,2002-03,"A special OTS scheme for small and marginal farmers will be announced by RBI to cover loans upto Rs 50,000."
13362,2002-03,The National Agriculture Insurance Scheme is already in operation.
13363,2002-03,To subserve the needs of farmers better and to move towards a sustainable actuarial regime I propose to set up a new Corporation for Agriculture Insurance to be promoted by the existing public sector general insurance companies.
13364,2002-03,I propose to increase the allocation for the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme AIBP from Rs 2000 crore this year to Rs 2800 crore in 200203.
13365,2002-03,"This will assist the States to accelerate the completion of unfinished medium and major irrigation projects, and also to undertake reforms by revising user charges and setting up of water users associations."
13366,2002-03,Agriculture Extension and Research 17.
13367,2002-03,The accelerated diversification and modernization of agriculture will require a new approach to research and extension services.
13368,2002-03,I therefore propose to enhance the allocation for 200203 for agriculture research to Rs 775 crore from Rs 684 crore in the current year.
13369,2002-03,A full review of the governance of agricultural research is also proposed so that the system can serve the new needs creatively.
13370,2002-03,Linkages between research and extension will be strengthened to improve quality and effectiveness of research and extension systems.
13371,2002-03,"The extension system will be revitalised and broadbased through Krishi Vigyan Kendras KVKs, NGOs, farmers organisations, cooperatives, the corporate sector and agribusiness clinics."
13372,2002-03,"KVKs will be designated as nodal agencies for quality certification including organic products, biofertilizers, and biopesticides."
13373,2002-03,"The supply of inputs, agroprocessing and trade through such cooperatives/companies will be encouraged through the availability of credit with the help of NABARD."

13375,2002-03,Promotion of agricultural exports is important for creating conditions for providing remunerative prices to farm produce.

13377,2002-03,APEDA will catalyse development of infrastructure and flow of credit to the units in these Agri Export zones.

13381,2002-03,Depending on the accelerated implementation of these works I intend to find additional resources including those from multilateral sources in the course of the year.
13382,2002-03,"During my last budget speech I had announced a package of initiatives for electrification of 80,000 villages that have no access to electricity."
13383,2002-03,"Considering the fact that SEBs find it difficult to service debt, the Government proposes to introduce a new interest subsidy scheme called the Accelerated Rural Electrification Programme."
13384,2002-03,An outlay of Rs 164 crore has been provided for this scheme in 200203.
13385,2002-03,"The Sampoorna Grameen Rozgar Yojana SGRY announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech of 2001 was launched on September 25, 2001 by merging the ongoing Employment Assurance Scheme EAS and the Jawahar Gram Samridhi Yojana JGSY."
13386,2002-03,"Since the launch of the scheme, release of 30.6 lakh tonnes of food grains to States has already been authorised, out of the 50 lakh tonnes allocated."
13387,2002-03,This scheme will be continued next year.
13388,2002-03,I urge upon all the States to come forward to take full advantage of the free foodgrains being offered under this scheme.
13389,2002-03,Lok Nayak Shri Jai Prakash Narayan always had a special concern for the disadvantaged.
13390,2002-03,In his birth centenary year I propose to launch the Jai Prakash Rozgar Guarantee Yojana JPRGY to provide employment guarantee to the unemployed in the most distressed districts of the country.
13391,2002-03,"A Task Force headed by my colleague, the Minister of Rural Development, will be set up to design and implement a massive programme for employment generation in these districts."
13392,2002-03,"KVIC, DC SSI, and other agencies will be fully involved in the implementation of this scheme."
13393,2002-03,The promotion of rural industrialisation would be helped greatly through capacity building and technology upgradation in Khadi and Village Industries.

13395,2002-03,The diversification of agriculture will not succeed without appropriate infrastructure for marketing.
13396,2002-03,"For this purpose, rural local bodies, cooperatives and NGOs will be assisted to set up rural produce marketing centres and subcentres at the district and block levels and to upgrade village haats under a special scheme of the Swaran Jayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojana SJGSY."
13397,2002-03,Some parts of our country have been particularly afflicted with natural calamities.

13400,2002-03,Management of the Food Economy 27.
13401,2002-03,I had drawn attention last year to the severe policy and fiscal difficulties arising from the growing mismatch between the unprecedented level of procurement of wheat and rice by FCI and the much lower PDS and buffer stock needs in the last few years.
13402,2002-03,The current situation of openended procurement by FCI at a high price and disposal at a heavily subsidised price is not sustainable.
13403,2002-03,The concept of decentralised procurement has not yet found favour with the States.
13404,2002-03,The report of the High Level Committee on Long Term Grain Policy is expected to be submitted shortly.
13405,2002-03,We shall formulate a more durable approach for better management of our food economy after considering this report.
13406,2002-03,A number of steps have been taken by the Government to reduce the high food grain stocks that are posing serious problems of storage and disposal.
13407,2002-03,These measures include: increased allocations for BPL familiies; launching of a major food for work programme under the SGRY; allocation of 30 lakh tonnes of free foodgrains to States for relief works in areas affected by natural calamities; open market sales of 30 lakh tonnes this year compared to 5.5 lakh tonnes in 20002001; and enhanced incentives for export of food grains.
13408,2002-03,Provision of efficient and world class infrastructure is critical for our growth aspirations.
13409,2002-03,A key issue that bears repetition is the imposition of appropriate user charges necessary to provide adequate returns on investment.
13410,2002-03,"Some success has been achieved in areas such as telecom, roads and ports where appropriate user charges exist."
13411,2002-03,"With the tariff rationalization and other bold measures introduced by my colleague, the Minister of Railways, we can expect the Railways to serve well the key transportation needs of the country in the years to come."
13412,2002-03,"Other areas such as power, urban infrastructure, other transportation and the like continue to experience great difficulty because of the lack of appropriate user charges."
13413,2002-03,Restoration of financial viability in the power sector remains crucial.
13414,2002-03,The average rate of return for all SEBs is about minus 40 per cent and their combined losses continue to increase.
13415,2002-03,"Hence, this is one of the foremost challenges not only in the power sector but also for the fiscal health of the state governments and the overall performance of the economy."
13416,2002-03,"In recognition of these severe problems the Prime Minister held a meeting with State Chief Ministers on March 3, 2001."
13417,2002-03,"While broadly agreeing with the desirability of power sector reforms to achieve commercial viability of State Electricity Boards, the conference placed special emphasis on distribution reforms and elimination of theft of electricity."
13418,2002-03,"Subsequently, the high level empowered group of Chief Ministers and Union Ministers has agreed to a one time settlement scheme in regard to SEB overdues to the Central Public Sector Utilities through securitisation and issue of tax free bonds by the respective State Governments, subject to the achievement of specified performance milestones and full payment of current dues in the future."
13419,2002-03,I would urge upon the States to come forward and implement the scheme speedily.
13420,2002-03,The Ministry of Power has already signed Memoranda of Understanding MOUs with 20 States and is expected to complete the exercise with the remaining States soon.
13421,2002-03,"To redouble our effort in this direction APDP is being redesigned as the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme APDRP, with an enhanced plan allocation of Rs 3,500 crore for 200203, up from Rs 1,500 crore this year."
13422,2002-03,"Access of the States to the fund will be on the basis of agreed reform programmes, the centre piece of which would be the narrowing and ultimate elimination of the gap between unit cost of supply and revenue realisation within a specified time frame."
13423,2002-03,"Accordingly, the focus of reform has shifted from generation to transmission and distribution."
13424,2002-03,A high level monitoring group will oversee the progress of this programme.
13425,2002-03,Allocation for this programme will be augmented by loans on concessional terms from the Power Finance Corporation PFC.
13426,2002-03,I am glad to inform the House that the Prime Minister’s National Highway Development Programme NHDP launched three years ago is progressing well.
13427,2002-03,It now promises to achieve a totally new scenario in the road sector.

13430,2002-03,"With the assistance of multilateral funding, other borrowings by the National Highway Authority of India NHAI with government guarantee, and other innovative financing schemes, the funding for this phase will be fully tied up in 200203."
13431,2002-03,The present Port Trust structure does not allow Indian major ports to have the flexibility needed for efficient management and for raising institutional funding.
13432,2002-03,It is therefore proposed to corporatise major ports in a phased manner.
13433,2002-03,"Private sector investments have been facilitated and 17 projects worth more than Rs 4,500 crore have already been approved and another 8 projects worth more than Rs 3,200 crore are under consideration."
13434,2002-03,"With corporatisation of the existing ports and new private sector ports coming up, the regulatory structure will be strengthened."
13435,2002-03,"The Government has already announced its decision to upgrade the international airports at Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata to the standards of world class airports by inducting private sector management and investment through long term leasing systems."
13436,2002-03,Modalities for inviting offers have been finalised and the leasing process will be completed in 200203.
13437,2002-03,Private sector participation in greenfield airports will be encouraged through a package of concessions: Availability of land and related infrastructure from the State Governments.

13442,2002-03,The proposed new airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad will benefit from these concessions.
13443,2002-03,"The 2001 census shows that the urban population in India is now about 285 million, greater than the total population of the United States."
13444,2002-03,The number of cities with more than one million population has increased from 23 in 1991 to 35 in 2001.
13445,2002-03,We are aware of the sad plight of most of our towns and cities.
13446,2002-03,"This needs to be changed if they have to act as engines of growth, and if they are to provide a healthy environment for our citizens."
13447,2002-03,"Hence, we can no longer afford to delay reforms in this sector."
13448,2002-03,I propose to set up an Urban Reform Incentive Fund URIF with an initial allocation of Rs 500 crore to provide reform linked assistance to States.
13449,2002-03,The Fund will seek to incentivise reforms in the following areas: Reform of Rent Control Laws and repeal of Urban Land Ceiling Acts.
13450,2002-03,Rationalisation of high stamp duty regimes.
13451,2002-03,"Revision of byelaws to streamline the approvals process for construction of buildings, development of sites, etc. Revision of municipal laws in line with model legislation prepared by the Ministry of Urban Development and Poverty Alleviation."

13453,2002-03,Levy of realistic user charges and resource mobilization by urban local bodies.
13454,2002-03,A City Challenge Fund CCF will also be set up as an incentive based facility that will support cities to fund transitional costs of moving towards sustainable and creditworthy institutional systems of municipal management and service delivery.
13455,2002-03,It will assist in the partial financing of the cost of developing an economic reform programme and financially viable projects to be undertaken by urban local bodies.
13456,2002-03,It is also proposed to set up a Pooled Finance Development Scheme to provide credit enhancement to assist local bodies to access market borrowing on a creditworthy basis.
13457,2002-03,"To provide a further incentive for urban local bodies to become credit worthy and to invest in urban infrastructure I am providing for the issue of municipal tax free bonds upto Rs 500 crore in 200203, up from Rs 200 crore this year."
13458,2002-03,"Tourism constitutes a priority area in view of its beneficial impact on growth of employment, generation of foreign exchange, and the promotion of greater national integration through domestic tourism."
13459,2002-03,It is therefore proposed to implement a comprehensive tourism development package: 6 tourism circuits would be identified for development to international standards during 200203.
13460,2002-03,Special Purpose Vehicles SPVs will be permitted to raise resources from both public and private sectors for infrastructure development in these circuits.
13461,2002-03,"One special area, the World Heritage Site of Hampi, will be developed as an international destination for tourism based on an integrated master plan."
13462,2002-03,The Plan Outlay for tourism has accordingly been increased by 50 per cent to Rs 225 crore for 200203.
13463,2002-03,I will have more to say on the fiscal measures relating to tourism in part B of my speech.
13464,2002-03,Members are aware of the continuing effort that we have made to attract private sector investment in the infrastructure sector to supplement public investment.
13465,2002-03,The flow of investment has however been slow except in the telecom sector.
13466,2002-03,I therefore propose to take the following measures to facilitate faster private investment in infrastructure facilities: An Infrastructure Equity Fund of Rs 1000 crore will be set up to help in providing equity investment for infrastructure projects.
13467,2002-03,"Contributions to the Fund to be managed by the Infrastructure Development Finance Company Limited IDFC, would initially be made by public sector insurance companies, financial institutions and some banks."
13468,2002-03,An institutional mechanism is being set up to coordinate the debt financing by financial institutions and banks of infrastructure projects larger than Rs 250 crore.
13469,2002-03,IDFC will act as the coordinating institution with primary responsibility for different sectors being shared with the IDBI and ICICI.
13470,2002-03,"Public private partnerships will be encouraged for the provision of infrastructure facilities, the modalities for which are being worked out by a Task Force."
13471,2002-03,Public Investment in key infrastructure sectors is also being sharply stepped up.
13472,2002-03,"Plan outlay inclusive of internal and extra budgetary resources in power, roads and national highways and railways is being increased by 22 per cent, 39 per cent and 23 per cent respectively, to a total of Rs 37919 crore."

13476,2002-03,To help investors plan their investments better and to add transparency and stability in the market RBI will announce an issuance calendar for dated government securities.
13477,2002-03,Having now received the concurrence of all state legislatures I also propose to introduce a new Government Securities Bill to replace the old Public Debt Act 1949 within this Parliament Session.
13478,2002-03,In view of the various disturbances that have occurred in the capital market it is important to boost investor confidence and to strengthen market integrity.
13479,2002-03,The following measures are being taken.
13480,2002-03,"The process of demutualisation and corporatisation of stock exchanges is expected to be completed during the course of the year, to implement the decision to separate ownership, management and operation of stock exchanges."

13485,2002-03,I propose that now FII portfolio investments will not be subject to the sectoral limits for foreign direct investment except in specified sectors.
13486,2002-03,Guidelines in this regard will be issued separately.
13487,2002-03,Further measures have been taken to develop and deepen the capital market:

13499,2002-03,"To help banks and financial institutions to make provisions for NPAs as required by the RBI, additional fiscal relief is being offered, details of which will be given in part B of my speech."
13500,2002-03,This will enable banks to review their lending rates.
13501,2002-03,A new Bill on Banking Sector Reforms is proposed to be introduced in Parliament to strengthen creditor rights through foreclosure and enforcement of securities by banks and financial institutions.

13511,2002-03,Three public sector banks had been classified as weak banks on the basis of criteria suggested by the Committee on Banking Sector Reforms in 1997 98.
13512,2002-03,Two of these banks namely UCO Bank and United Bank of India have turned around and have started making profits.

13643,2002-03,"Film exports have been roughly doubling every year, during the last 3 years."
13644,2002-03,It is time we brought about a fiscal regime to usher in more “Khushi” and take away the remaining “Gham” from the entertainment industry.
13645,2002-03,"In every budget speech I have, at the risk of irritating repetition, expressed my deep concern at the poor fiscal situation of the Central and State Governments."
13646,2002-03,Reflecting this concern I had introduced in Parliament the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Bill in December 2000.
13647,2002-03,The recommendations of the Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance are receiving our attention and I propose to bring the Bill for consideration in this august House within the current session.
13648,2002-03,I had proposed to reduce the estimated fiscal deficit of 5.1 per cent in RE 20002001 to 4.7 per cent of GDP in BE 200102.
13649,2002-03,"The industrial slowdown experienced in both 200001 and the current year has reflected itself in the much lower than expected revenue collections from customs duties, excise duties and corporate income tax."
13650,2002-03,"The NonPlan expenditure, however, has been kept under strict check: as a consequence, Mr. Speaker, Sir, you will be pleased to hear that NonPlan expenditure for the current year is lower by more than Rs 10,000 crore over the budgeted amount."
13651,2002-03,"However, mindful of the industrial slowdown, and the need for continued public investment, Plan expenditure has not only been protected but is actually higher than BE."
13652,2002-03,The GDP estimate for the year has also been lowered.
13653,2002-03,As a result fiscal deficit in now expected to be 5.7 per cent of GDP in the current year.
13654,2002-03,Putting our fiscal house in order must remain our highest priority.
13655,2002-03,We have to make every effort to contain non productive expenditure and make substantive improvements in our tax machinery so that revenue collections show higher buoyancy in coming years.
13656,2002-03,I will shortly outline my plans in this regard in Part B of my speech.
13657,2002-03,The fastest increasing component of expenditure is that of subsidies.
13658,2002-03,It is essential that they are reduced to a minimum over the next 3 to 5 years.
13659,2002-03,"However, access of the poor to adequate levels of nutrition through a well targetted PDS will have to be ensured along with employment generation programmes."
13660,2002-03,The success achieved in containing NonPlan expenditure has encouraged me to deepen the efforts in this direction.
13661,2002-03,The recommendations of the Expenditure Reforms Commission ERC provide a very useful framework for immediate moderation in expenditure growth.
13662,2002-03,The ERC completed its work in September 2001 and submitted 10 reports covering 36 Ministries/Departments that had a total sanctioned staff of 8.65 lakh.
13663,2002-03,"Of the identified surplus manpower of 42,200 in these Ministries/ Departments, nearly 12,200 posts are expected to be abolished by the end of March 2002."
13664,2002-03,The remaining reports are at different stages of consideration.
13665,2002-03,The decision to limit fresh recruitment to 1 per cent of total civilian staff strength will continue to be implemented over the next 4 years.
13666,2002-03,The availability of a VRS package that has now 20 been approved will help this effort to reduce staff strength while ensuring adequate security to the affected employees.
13667,2002-03,We have made efforts to contain the fertiliser subsidy by plugging inefficiencies in the production system which were earlier passed on to the government by the producers and by periodical increases in the issue prices.
13668,2002-03,The ERC has recommended that the Government should increase prices by 7 per cent every year and move towards decontrol over the next 5 years.
13669,2002-03,Fertiliser prices have not been increased for the last two years.
13670,2002-03,"I propose a modest increase in the issue price of urea, DAP and MOP by about 5 per cent and to reduce the subsidy for SSP by Rs 50 per tonne."
13671,2002-03,The prices of complex fertilisers will also be suitably modified.
13672,2002-03,The Ministries of Agriculture and Chemicals and Fertilisers will notify the specific increases.
13673,2002-03,"In a further move towards price and distribution control, the compulsory levy on sugar will be reduced from 15 to 10 per cent from March 1, 2002."
13674,2002-03,"Accordingly, the retail price of PDS sugar will be Rs 13.50 per kg."
13675,2002-03,"Because of the rising cost of Postal Service, a modest increase in postal rates is being proposed."
13676,2002-03,Small Savings and Interest Rates 89.
13677,2002-03,"Last year I had announced the setting up of an Expert Committee headed by Deputy Governor, RBI to suggest rationalisation of administered interest rates."
13678,2002-03,"The Committee has given its report, which has been examined by the Government."
13679,2002-03,"Accordingly, I propose to take the following measures: Administered interest rates will now be benchmarked to the average annual yields of government securities of equivalent maturities in the secondary market."
13680,2002-03,"Accordingly, most administered interest rates are being reduced by 50 basis points from March 1, 2002."
13681,2002-03,Such adjustments will henceforth be made annually on a nondiscretionary automatic basis.
13682,2002-03,The benefit of reduction in interest rates on small savings deposits will be fully passed on to the States.
13683,2002-03,A corresponding reduction of 50 basis points will be made in the interest rate applicable to Government of India Relief Bonds.
13684,2002-03,"Further, a ceiling of Rs 2 lakh per year is being put on investment in these bonds."
13685,2002-03,"The entire net proceeds of small savings will be transferred to State Governments beginning April 1, 2002, up from the current transfer of 80 per cent."
13686,2002-03,"Consequently, additional loan assistance of about Rs 10,000 crore will be available to the States along with the benefits of a lower interest rate."
13687,2002-03,State Governments will be enabled to prepay their high cost debt of the past from these additional resources which would be at a lower interest rate.
13688,2002-03,Modalities of this prepayment of small savings debt of State Government will be worked out in consultation with them and the Reserve Bank of India.
13689,2002-03,The interest rate on the loans portion of Central assistance to State plans is being reduced by 50 basis points.
13690,2002-03,"Revisions are being made in the tax treatment of small savings, which will be outlined in Part B of my speech."
13691,2002-03,The implementation of this long sought reform in the treatment of small savings and administered interest rates is another step forward in the deregulation of interest rates in the economy that has been carried out in phases over the last 10 years.
13692,2002-03,This should help in reducing the interest burden on the government and private sector alike in future.
13693,2002-03,The present pension scheme for Government employees casts an open ended financial burden on the Government.
13694,2002-03,"I had announced the appointment of a High Level Expert Group to develop a new pension scheme, based on defined contributions, for new recruits entering government service."
13695,2002-03,The Expert Group has submitted its report to the Government.
13696,2002-03,"It has proposed a hybrid scheme that combines contributions from employees and the Union Government on matching basis, on the one hand, while committing to the employees a defined benefit as pension."
13697,2002-03,"The report is being considered by the Government and the new pension scheme for new recruits will be announced and implemented by June 1, 2002."
13698,2002-03,"With the streamlined procedure for disinvestment and privatization, I am happy to report that the Government has now completed strategic sales in 7 public sector companies and some hotel properties of the Hotel Corporation of India HCI and the India Tourism Development Corporation ITDC."
13699,2002-03,The change in approach from the disinvestments of small lots of shares to strategic sales of blocks of shares to strategic investors has improved the price earning ratios obtained.
13700,2002-03,We expect to complete the disinvestment in another 6 companies and the remaining hotels in HCI and ITDC this year.
13701,2002-03,"Disinvestment receipts for the present year are estimated at Rs 5,000 crore excluding the special dividend from VSNL of Rs 1,887crore."
13702,2002-03,"Encouraged by these results, I am once again taking credit for a receipt of Rs 12,000 crore from disinvestment next year."
13703,2002-03,Modernisation and upgradation of our Defence preparedness is an area of highest national priority.
13704,2002-03,"I have made a provision of Rs 65,000 crore for defence expenditure for next year."
13705,2002-03,"In case of need, I shall not hesitate to provide more funds for this purpose."
13706,2002-03,"As a measure of welfare of the defence forces and their families, and, as announced by the Prime Minister in his Independence Day speech, a major programme of housing construction for defence personnel is also being taken up."
13707,2002-03,The challenge of fiscal management is equally acute in the case of States.
13708,2002-03,We have been working jointly with the States through the Fiscal Reforms Incentive 22 Fund set up on the recommendations of the Eleventh Finance Commission.
13709,2002-03,Some State governments have taken bold measures to bring down nonproductive expenditure to improve their fiscal situation.
13710,2002-03,The reform of small savings schemes together with interest rate reductions and debt swap facility that I have already mentioned will also help the States.
13711,2002-03,It will be our joint endeavour to bring down the consolidated debt to GDP ratios to sustainable levels by 2005.
13712,2002-03,"As I have mentioned earlier, we are now providing reform linked assistance to States for a number of sectors like APDRP, AIBP, URIF, RIDF for which a total amount of Rs 12,300 crore has been provided."
13713,2002-03,"In addition, a lumpsum amount of Rs 2,500 crore has been provided for policy reforms in sectors which are constraining growth and development."
13714,2002-03,"I am confident that with the joint efforts of Centre and the States we will be able to put in place programmes and policies which will remove barriers to growth, accelerate the development process and improve the quality of life of our people."
13715,2002-03,BUDGET ESTIMATESRevised Estimates for 20012002 96.
13716,2002-03,"The revised estimates for the current fiscal year show a decrease in expenditure of Rs 10,787 crore as compared to the Budget estimates."
13717,2002-03,"Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated to be Rs 1,42,348 crore compared to the Budget estimate of Rs 1,63,031 crore, thereby reflecting a shortfall of Rs 20,683 crore."
13718,2002-03,The major shortfall is due to lower collection of Customs and Union Excise duties due mainly to the industrial slowdown.
13719,2002-03,"Non tax revenue is estimated at Rs 70,224 crore, Rs 1,510 crore more than the estimated level of Rs 68,714 crore."
13720,2002-03,"However, disinvestment receipts, at Rs 5000 crore are much lower than the Budget estimate of Rs 12,000 crore."

13734,2002-03,"They are also aimed at widening the tax base, rationalization and simplification of tax structures and encouraging voluntary compliance."
13735,2002-03,I present my indirect tax proposals first.
13736,2002-03,"Sir, in my earlier budgets I have made strenuous efforts to address the issues of cascading, distortions, anomalies and inequities in the commodity tax structure."
13737,2002-03,I have achieved significant rationalization of tax structures relating to both excise and customs duties.
13738,2002-03,"The number of rates are few, and procedures more transparent than before."
13739,2002-03,"The service tax, though confined to limited number of services, has gained ground."
13740,2002-03,"In 20002001, I had introduced the rate of 16% as the rate of Central Value Added Tax CENVAT in the excise duty structure."
13741,2002-03,"Last year, I had reduced the three rates of special excise duty to a single rate of 16%."
13742,2002-03,This rationalization in the duty structure has considerably reduced disputes and litigation and the cost of compliance to the assessees.
13743,2002-03,"Above all, it has put in place a system, which is stable, just and rational."
13744,2002-03,We only need to refine it further.
13745,2002-03,I propose to abolish the 16% special excise duty on a number of items.
13746,2002-03,"Henceforth, the special excise duty shall be confined to the following 8 items only: Polyester Filament Yarn Motor cars Multi Utility Vehicles Tyres for replacement Aerated soft drinks and soft drink concentrates Air conditioners Pan Masala, and Chewing Tobacco & miscellaneous tobacco preparations"
13747,2002-03,"I propose to do away with the concessional rate of 8% excise duty applicable to LPG, kerosene, auto CNG and diesel engines upto 10 HP which will now attract the CENVAT rate of 16%."
13748,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker Sir, the rates of excise duty have now been considerably moderated."
13749,2002-03,"However, several exemptions still continue."
13750,2002-03,In my last budget I had imposed excise duty at a moderate rate of 4% on a few items.
13751,2002-03,I propose to increase this rate from 4% to the next slab of 8% this year.
13752,2002-03,"Simultaneously, I propose to impose excise duty at 4% on a few more items, which have remained exempted so far."
13753,2002-03,"Cigars, cheroots and cigarillos of tobacco or tobacco substitutes which have been exempt so far shall attract 16% CENVAT."
13754,2002-03,"In view of the abolition of Administered Price Mechanism on petroleum products and in order to provide for the subsidy on LPG and kerosene oil, I propose to make some changes in the duty structure of petroleum products."
13755,2002-03,The rate of cess applicable to indigenous crude oil under the Oil Industry Development Act will be increased from Rs 900 per metric tonne to Rs 1800 per metric tonne with effect from 1st March 2002.
13756,2002-03,I propose to reduce the ad valorem rate of excise duty applicable to motor spirit from 90% to 32%.
13757,2002-03,"However, I propose to impose on it a surcharge of six rupees per litre."
13758,2002-03,But the surcharge on ethanol doped motor spirit will be five rupees and twenty five paise per litre.
13759,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the Indian textile industry occupies an important place in our economy."
13760,2002-03,It is the second largest provider of employment after agriculture.
13761,2002-03,The Multi Fibre Agreement will be phased out by 2004.
13762,2002-03,Domestic market has already been opened up.
13763,2002-03,Our textile industry has to prepare itself for the challenges ahead.
13764,2002-03,I have carved out a special package of incentives for the textile industry.
13765,2002-03,I propose to maintain the excise duty rates on yarns.
13766,2002-03,"At present, cotton hank yarn is exempt from excise duty but is being widely misused."
13767,2002-03,"In order to ensure that the benefit accrues only to the handloom weavers I propose to bring hank yarn within the net of excise duty at 8%, but at the same time, provide for appropriate subsidy on the price of hank yarn purchased by them."
13768,2002-03,This will put an end to misuse and target the subsidy better.
13769,2002-03,The Ministry of Textiles would announce the details of the subsidy scheme.
13770,2002-03,"In order to enable the weavers to avail of CENVAT credit scheme, I propose to allow the weavers of grey fabrics to pay excise duty on an optional basis."
13771,2002-03,I propose to extend a similar option to the knitting sector.
13772,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in all humility, I can claim credit for introducing the CENVAT rate of 16% in the excise duty structure."
13773,2002-03,"However, in the case of textiles, I am making an exception and granting a remission of 4%."
13774,2002-03,"The rate of excise duty on fabrics, made ups and garments would be 12%."
13775,2002-03,This special dispensation shall continue upto 28.2.2005.
13776,2002-03,Industrial fabrics would however continue at 16%.
13777,2002-03,"At present, hand processing of textile fabrics by independent processors is exempt from excise duty even if power is used on 12 specified processes in the case of cotton fabrics or 7 specified processes in the case of man made fabrics."
13778,2002-03,"I propose to confine this exemption to only 3 processes, namely, scouring, hydroextraction and calendering."
13779,2002-03,I propose to abolish the compounded levy scheme for independent power processors as it is incongruous with the reduced rate of duty that I have proposed.
13780,2002-03,Handloom sector is not affected by my budget proposals.
13781,2002-03,Excise duty exemption on handloom fabrics continues.
13782,2002-03,I now propose to grant exemption to handloom garments also from excise duty subject to certification by Handloom Export Promotion Council.
13783,2002-03,"In order to enable the textile industry to modernize itself and acquire new technology, I propose to exempt excise duty on automatic shuttleless looms."
13784,2002-03,"I also propose to exempt excise duty on specified processing machinery and specified silk reeling, weaving and twisting machinery."
13785,2002-03,The customs duty on such machinery is also proposed to be reduced from 25% to 10%.
13786,2002-03,I also propose to exempt specified jute machinery from excise duty.
13787,2002-03,I hope this package will enable the textile industry to face global competition.
13788,2002-03,My proposals include special dispensation of excise duty structure for the petroleum refineries located in the North East Region.
13789,2002-03,"With effect from 1st March 2002, the petroleum products produced by all these refineries shall be charged to excise duty at half of the normal rates of excise duty otherwise applicable to petroleum products."
13790,2002-03,Inland Air Travel Tax is exempted for air travel within the North East States.
13791,2002-03,I propose to extend this exemption on air travel to and from North East States.
13792,2002-03,Tea industry is currently facing a number of problems in the domestic as well as international markets for a variety of reasons.
13793,2002-03,"In order to promote the interest of tea growers, I propose to reduce the excise duty on tea from Rs 2 per kg to Re.1 per kg."
13794,2002-03,We have to face the menace of HIVAIDS with determination.
13795,2002-03,I propose to exempt specified antiAIDS drugs from excise duty with effect from 1st March 2002.
13796,2002-03,Specified cold chain equipment are exempt from excise duty.
13797,2002-03,I propose to add three more equipment to this list to promote the preservation of fruits and vegetables.
13798,2002-03,The excise duty exemption scheme for the smallscale sector is applicable to granite.
13799,2002-03,"In view of the fact that it is not available to marble, I propose to withdraw this exemption from granite also."
13800,2002-03,The scheme of excise duty assessment based on Maximum Retail Price of goods has resolved valuation disputes in a dramatic way.
13801,2002-03,"I propose to extend this scheme to 9 more categories of items this year, thus raising the number to 92 categories of items."
13802,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the justification of taxing more services does not require any elaboration."
13803,2002-03,"This year, I propose to extend the service tax to the following services: Life insurance, including insurance auxiliary services relating to life insurance Inland cargo handling 26 Storage and warehousing services except for agriculture produce and cold storages Event management Rail travel agents Health Clubs & Fitness Centres Beauty parlours Fashion designers Cable operators Dry cleaning services 128."
13804,2002-03,Service tax is applicable to specified services provided by banks and non banking financial companies.
13805,2002-03,I propose to extend the service tax to corporate bodies that provide similar services.
13806,2002-03,The tax on these services shall come into force from a notified date.
13807,2002-03,Our tourism industry has been adversely affected by recent events.
13808,2002-03,"In December 2001, I had announced exemption from service tax on the services provided by hotels."
13809,2002-03,The exemption expires on 31st March 2002.
13810,2002-03,I propose to extend this exemption for one more year upto 31st March 2003.
13811,2002-03,"Sir, I now present my proposals relating to customs duties."
13812,2002-03,"The House may recall that, in my last budget, I had announced that I would move progressively to reduce the peak rate of customs duty to 20% within three years."
13813,2002-03,I had also said that the modalities for this would be worked out in time for the next budget.
13814,2002-03,I had accordingly set up an InterMinisterial Working Group to recommend the modalities.
13815,2002-03,The Group has suggested a road map for this starting with this year’s budget.
13816,2002-03,"After careful consideration of the Group’s report, I have decided that, by the year 200405, there would be only two basic rates of customs duties, namely, 10% covering generally raw materials, intermediates and components and 20% covering generally final products."
13817,2002-03,The existing rates would be adjusted and subsumed in these two basic rates with some exceptions on account of WTO bindings or higher tariffs for agricultural products.
13818,2002-03,"In accordance with the road map, I propose to reduce the peak rate from 35% to 30% this year."
13819,2002-03,I also propose to make some changes to take care of some current problems.
13820,2002-03,Our steel industry has been affected by slowdown in demand and has suffered large losses.
13821,2002-03,In order to reduce its cost of production I propose to lower customs duty on a number of refractory raw materials by 10%.
13822,2002-03,"These include natural graphite powder, silicon metal, sintered alumina, fused zirconia and boron carbide."
13823,2002-03,I also propose to reduce the duty on graphite electrodes of above 24 inches diameter from 25% to 15%.
13824,2002-03,Ships imported for breaking are charged to customs duty at 5% along with CVD and special additional duty.
13825,2002-03,I propose to revise this by increasing the basic duty on ships for breaking from 5% to 15% and exempting them from CVD and special additional duty.
13826,2002-03,This is to reduce the disparity between rolled products produced by the steel plants and cheaper products produced from ship breaking.
13827,2002-03,The steel industry is troubled by imports of seconds and defectives at cheaper prices.
13828,2002-03,In order to address their concern I propose to increase the basic customs duty on seconds and defectives of steel to the bound rate of 40%.
13829,2002-03,Nonferrous metals are used for large number of applications by different segments of industry.
13830,2002-03,"I propose to reduce the customs duty on copper, zinc and lead from 35% to 25% and on aluminium and tin from 25% to 15%."
13831,2002-03,"In the EXIM policy for the year 20002001, my colleague, the Minister of Commerce and Industry announced the scheme of setting up Special Economic Zones that are intended to provide comprehensive facilities at one place for export production."
13832,2002-03,"Special Economic Zones would be entitled to procure duty free equipment, raw materials, components, etc. whether imported or purchased locally."
13833,2002-03,The benefit of such exemption shall be applicable to both the developers of Special Economic Zones as well as the units located therein.
13834,2002-03,"In order to encourage development of world class infrastructure facilities, I propose to reduce the customs duty on specified equipment for Ports and Airports to 10%."
13835,2002-03,"In view of the difficulties being faced by the civil aviation sector, I propose to exempt duty on aeroplanes, helicopters, gliders, simulators of aeroplanes and their parts and raw materials."
13836,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, India is signatory to the Information Technology Agreement."
13837,2002-03,"The House may recall that, in 1998, I had announced that zero duty regime on IT products would be preponed and implemented by 2003."
13838,2002-03,"However, the local manufacturers have urged me strongly that it may be made effective only from the year 2005."
13839,2002-03,This would give them an opportunity to gear up to meet the challenge of international competition.
13840,2002-03,I have decided to accept their demand.
13841,2002-03,"As a further measure of assistance to indigenous industry, I propose to reduce the customs duty on a number of hardware inputs to 5% and on certain capital goods to 15%."
13842,2002-03,The duty on certain IT items would be reduced to 10% or 5% as per the WTO binding.
13843,2002-03,The use of cellular phones is increasing by leaps and bounds but import through unauthorized channels is a matter of concern.
13844,2002-03,"I therefore, propose to exempt cellular phones and pagers from CVD."
13845,2002-03,"The basic customs duty is, however, being increased from 5% to 10%."
13846,2002-03,"Sir, I have repeatedly assured the House that our customs tariffs would be pegged at appropriate levels to protect the interest of the farmers."
13847,2002-03,"In my last budget I had increased the customs duty on tea, coffee, copra, coconut and desiccated coconut to 70%."
13848,2002-03,"This year, I propose to increase the customs duty on tea and coffee to 100% and on natural rubber, poppy seeds, pepper, cloves and cardamom to 70%."
13849,2002-03,I also propose to increase the duty on pulses from 5% to 10%.
13850,2002-03,I propose to reduce the customs duty on agricultural machinery and implements from 25% to 15% to encourage our farmers to acquire new and efficient technology.
13851,2002-03,A number of drugs are exempt from customs duty.
13852,2002-03,I propose to include eight more drugs used for treatment of cancer and some other critical diseases in 28 the list of fully exempted drugs.
13853,2002-03,Vaccine for immunisation against Japanese Encephalitis shall also be exempt from customs duty.
13854,2002-03,It has been reported that certain drugs that are presently exempted from customs duty are now made indigenously.
13855,2002-03,"In order to provide reasonable incentive to the domestic manufacturers of these drugs, I propose to impose a basic customs duty of 5% on these drugs."
13856,2002-03,India has a large number of diabetic patients.
13857,2002-03,They have to undergo frequent blood sugar tests.
13858,2002-03,"In order to provide some relief to them, I propose to reduce the customs duty on Glucometers and test strips from 25% to 10%."
13859,2002-03,As a measure of rationalization and removal of anomaly I propose to reduce the customs duty on nonPDS kerosene from 35% to 20% and increase the customs duty on kerosene sold under the PDS scheme from 5% to 10%.
13860,2002-03,"In order to promote interest in science, I propose to reduce the customs duty on planetarium equipments, parts and accessories to 15% and also exempt them from CVD and special additional duty of customs."
13861,2002-03,India has the technical capability to become an uplinking hub for television channels for the SAARC countries.
13862,2002-03,"In order to promote stateoftheart uplinking facilities at competitive costs, I propose to reduce customs duty on certain earth station equipment and studio equipment from 35% to 25%."
13863,2002-03,I propose to reduce the customs duty on cement and clinkers from 25% to 20%.
13864,2002-03,This should help in keeping the domestic prices under control.
13865,2002-03,The customs duty on imported liquors is bound at 182% for the current year under the WTO.
13866,2002-03,"Accordingly, I propose to reduce the customs duty on these items from 210% to 182%."
13867,2002-03,I also propose to rationalize the rates of CVD applicable to liquors and wines to 75% for value upto US $ 25 per case and 50% for others.
13868,2002-03,Passengers returning from abroad on transfer of residence are allowed certain items of personal use on payment of customs duty at a flat rate of 35%.
13869,2002-03,"I propose to reduce this rate to 30% and also add a few more items like lap top computers, portable photocopy machines, digital video disc players, video cassette disc players in the eligible list of items."
13870,2002-03,The overall limit is also being raised from Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.
13871,2002-03,I propose to impose nominal customs duty of 5% on some of the items that are exempt at present.
13872,2002-03,I also propose to impose special additional duty on certain other items that are currently subjected to 5% customs duty.
13873,2002-03,I have proposed a few other changes that are of a minor nature.
13874,2002-03,"I have also proposed some legislative changes with regard to customs, excise and service tax laws that are contained in the Finance Bill."
13875,2002-03,I do not wish to take the time of the House in elaborating on them in detail.
13876,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the customs and excise duty structures have been greatly simplified in the past few years."
13877,2002-03,With the changes that I have proposed the revenue from 16% CENVAT will be more than 85% of the total revenue from ad valorem duties.
13878,2002-03,"In the next two years it can be reduced to one, namely 16%."
13879,2002-03,The customs tariff will also comprise of only two basic rates in three years’ time.
13880,2002-03,"In my previous budgets, I have also made considerable efforts to simplify procedures."
13881,2002-03,"However, the task is not yet complete."
13882,2002-03,Our tax administration needs to take full advantage of information technology.
13883,2002-03,"Our tax systems need to encourage voluntary compliance, provide efficient service to the taxpayers, eliminate unproductive work and enhance efficiency."
13884,2002-03,The discretionary powers need to be replaced by rulebased mechanism.
13885,2002-03,All these aspects of tax administration deserve to be examined in their entirety.
13886,2002-03,I propose to set up an Expert Committee to make a comprehensive study of these aspects.
13887,2002-03,My proposals on the excise side are estimated to result in a revenue gain of about Rs 6700 crore in a year.
13888,2002-03,On the customs side my proposals are estimated to result in a revenue loss of about Rs 2200 crore.
13889,2002-03,"However, I anticipate buoyancy in indirect tax revenue and estimate that the total collection next year would be Rs 1,43,702 crore."
13890,2002-03,Copies of the notifications issued to give effect to the changes in excise and customs duties shall be laid on the Table of the House in due course.
13891,2002-03,I now turn to Direct Taxes.
13892,2002-03,"Personal Income tax rates have been at 10%, 20% and 30% and corporation tax at 35% for several years."
13893,2002-03,"They are reasonable and therefore, I have left them unchanged in my last four budgets."
13894,2002-03,I do not propose to change them this year also.
13895,2002-03,"At the same time, it is important to recognise the need for specific interventions to provide a stimulus for industrial growth."
13896,2002-03,I have already mentioned the need to provide incentives for fresh investments in the industrial sector.
13897,2002-03,"To give impetus to such investment, I propose to allow additional depreciation at the rate of 15% on new plant and machinery acquired on or after 1st April, 2002 for setting up a new industrial unit, or for expanding the installed capacity of existing units by at least 25%."
13898,2002-03,There is disparity between the rates of Corporation tax applicable to foreign companies and domestic companies.
13899,2002-03,This disparity arose in the past partly due to certain levies like surcharge being applicable to domestic companies but not to foreign companies.
13900,2002-03,"To correct this, I propose to reduce the rate applicable to foreign companies from 48% to 40%."
13901,2002-03,"The smallscale industry sector has been making an important contribution to economic growth, and deserves continued support."
13902,2002-03,"In order to enable the Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI to augment its resources and provide cheaper credit to the small scale sector, I propose to allow capital gains exemption under section 54EC of the Incometax Act to amounts invested in bonds issued by SIDBI."
13903,2002-03,"In my Budget for 20002001, I had announced the setting up of a Credit Guarantee scheme for smallscale industries."
13904,2002-03,"Accordingly, the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Small Industries has been constituted."
13905,2002-03,I propose to grant full exemption from tax to the income of this Trust.
13906,2002-03,"Continuing the thrust given to the housing sector over the last four years, I propose to allow the deduction for interest payable on housing loans for selfoccupied houses even where such houses are acquired or constructed after 31st March 2003, as long as the acquisition or construction is completed within three years from the end of the financial year in which the loan was taken."
13907,2002-03,"For giving a further impetus to investment in the housing sector, I propose to extend the capital gains exemption provided in section 54EC of the Incometax Act to bonds issued by the National Housing Bank."
13908,2002-03,The shipping industry in India is internationally competitive and is capable of further growth.
13909,2002-03,"In my Budget for 20002001, I had provided for a deduction of the entire profits of a shipping company if the amount deducted was kept in a reserve for purchase of new ships."
13910,2002-03,"However, the aggregate of the amounts that can be transferred to such reserve is limited to twice the amount of the paid up share capital of the company."
13911,2002-03,I propose to extend it to cover share premium reserve and general reserve also.
13912,2002-03,This reserve will not be considered while computing the book profits and shipping companies would thus be out of the purview of minimum alternate tax MAT. 1 6 7 .
13913,2002-03,"Presently, banks are allowed to deduct upto 5% of their total income against provisions made by them for bad and doubtful debts."
13914,2002-03,In order to strengthen the financial position of banks I propose to increase this allowance to 7.5% of the total income.
13915,2002-03,"Further, in my budget for the year 19992000, I had granted an option to banks to deduct upto 5% of their NPAs falling in the category of loss or doubtful assets as on the last day of the accounting year."
13916,2002-03,"I propose to enhance this optional deduction to 10%, and also allow a similar option of deduction upto 10% of loss or doubtful assets to public financial institutions."
13917,2002-03,"There has been a persistent demand that the benefit of carry forward and set off of past losses in cases of mergers of companies owning industrial undertakings, should be extended to more sectors."
13918,2002-03,"The telecommunication sector, in particular, is undergoing a phase of rapid consolidation and expansion."
13919,2002-03,"With a view to encourage its growth, I propose to extend this benefit to companies providing telecom services and eligible for deduction under section 80IA."
13920,2002-03,"I also propose to constitute an expert group to examine the extension of this benefit to other companies in the services sector, including the financial services sector."
13921,2002-03,The deduction available under section 80HHD of the Incometax Act in respect of foreign exchange earnings of hotels or tour operators will be enhanced to bring it in line with the deduction available to exporters under section 80 HHC.
13922,2002-03,A deduction of 50% of the profits earned by units setting up and operating large convention centres will be allowed for 5 years under section 80IB.
13923,2002-03,I have emphasised the importance of the entertainment industry in Part A of my speech.
13924,2002-03,"To give a further boost to this fastgrowing sector, I propose to allow, for the next five years, a deduction of 50% of the profits earned by units constructing and operating multiplex theatres in nonmetropolitan towns."
13925,2002-03,"As a measure for protection and regeneration of our environment, I propose to provide for an incentive by way of tax deduction under section 35AC of the Incometax Act in respect of amounts paid to a company or institution approved by the National Committee for Social and Economic Welfare, for carrying out projects of softwood plantation on degraded nonforest land."
13926,2002-03,A deduction under this section will also be available in respect of payments towards conservation of natural resources and afforestation.
13927,2002-03,"Last year, for ensuring a degree of transparency in the affairs of charitable and religious trusts as well as certain other institutions claiming exemption under section 1023C, I had introduced provisions requiring them to publish their accounts in a local newspaper, if their total receipts during a year exceeded Rs 1 crore."
13928,2002-03,I have received a large number of representations pointing out the possibility of misuse of such information by antisocial elements.
13929,2002-03,"In view of these representations, I propose to delete this requirement."
13930,2002-03,I further propose to rationalise certain provisions relating to these trusts and institutions so as to allow the accumulation of any part of their income only upto a maximum period of five years and to clarify that intertrust donations may only be made either from the corpus or from the current year’s income.
13931,2002-03,"Following the Gujarat earthquake last year, I had granted a 100% tax deduction to donations made to certain approved charitable trusts and institutions that were to be applied before 31st March 2002 in relief work."
13932,2002-03,"As such relief work is still going on in many areas, I propose to extend the terminal date for utilisation of such donations from 31st March 2002 to 31st March 2003."
13933,2002-03,"Last year, I had rationalised the rules for valuation of perquisites on the basis of their cost to the employer, except in respect of houses and cars where different criteria are adopted for simplicity."
13934,2002-03,"To relieve the burden on lower salaried employees, I propose to provide that no perquisites will be assessed for the assessment year 20022003 in the case of employees whose taxable salary, excluding perquisites, is upto Rs 1,00,000."
13935,2002-03,"For subsequent years, I propose to give an option to the employer to pay the tax on perquisites on behalf of the employees."
13936,2002-03,"Under section 89 of the Incometax Act, a tax relief is provided in case of additional tax burden imposed in any one year due to receipt of arrears of salary."
13937,2002-03,"As a welfare measure, I propose to allow this relief also in cases where family pension is received in arrears."
13938,2002-03,"In continuation with the taxpayer friendly measures brought about by me in my earlier Budgets, I propose to abolish the provisions of Chapter XXC of the Incometax Act, which require a clearance to be obtained from the Appropriate Authority before registering a transfer of an immovable property."
13939,2002-03,"Sir, some of the exemptions and deductions currently provided in the Incometax Act have become redundant and are not in harmony with the moderate 32 tax regime that we have in India."
13940,2002-03,The Advisory Group on Tax Policy and Tax Administration for the 10th Plan has recommended deletion of a number of such exemptions.
13941,2002-03,I have carefully examined each recommendation of the Group and have come to the conclusion that some of these exemptions are indeed unnecessary.
13942,2002-03,"I, therefore, propose to withdraw or discontinue the exemptions, which are not required any longer."
13943,2002-03,"The Advisory Group has also recommended deletion of various exemptions granted to incomes of approved or notified bodies or institutions, including educational and medical institutions."
13944,2002-03,"I do not think that the exemptions allowed to these institutions and bodies, which are fulfilling social objectives, should be withdrawn."
13945,2002-03,"However, I propose to require all such bodies and institutions to file returns of income every year so as to enable a periodical verification of whether the prescribed conditions, which primarily relate to application of the income, are being fulfilled and also to enable the prescribed authority to withdraw the approval or notification of such entities if they are found to have violated any such conditions."
13946,2002-03,"Last year, I had withdrawn the taxexemption allowed to income earned by NABARD, National Housing Bank and SIDBI, since these institutions have come of age and are working on commercial lines."
13947,2002-03,"For the same reasons, I propose to withdraw this year the exemption allowed to income of the National Dairy Development Board, Prasar Bharati and the Oil Industry Development Board."
13948,2002-03,Various amendments made over the years in the rules relating to depreciation have given rise to a plethora of such rates for different types of assets.
13949,2002-03,"The relevance and the need to continue with these rates, and whether they should be scaled down to a maximum rate of 60%, should be a matter for open discussion."
13950,2002-03,The relevant details will be put up on the website of the Finance Ministry.
13951,2002-03,"After taking into account the views expressed, a revised schedule of depreciation rates will be notified."
13952,2002-03,"Under the present system of taxation of dividends and income from units, the company or the mutual fund pays a 10% tax, and the income is exempt in the hands of the recipient."
13953,2002-03,Such a system not only taxes income in the hands of a person to whom it does not belong; it also militates against the passthrough status which is the very essence of a mutual fund.
13954,2002-03,"There is also an inherent inequity in the present system, which allows persons in the highincome groups to be taxed at much lower rates than the rates applicable to them."
13955,2002-03,"These issues have been troubling me over the past four years, and I am now convinced that the existing system must go."
13956,2002-03,"I, therefore, propose to abolish the distribution tax of 10% on companies and mutual funds on the dividends or income distributed by them."
13957,2002-03,"Such income will henceforth be taxed in the hands of the recipients at the rates applicable to them, and will be subject to tax deduction at source at the rate of 10%."
13958,2002-03,"In order to avoid a cascading effect, companies receiving such income will be entitled to claim a deduction for the amount in turn distributed by them as dividends."
13959,2002-03,"To continue the support given by me to equity oriented funds of the UTI and other mutual funds, the income received during the financial year 20022003 by unit holders of such funds will be taxed only at 10% as at present."
13960,2002-03,"A tax rebate of 20% of the amount invested in certain instruments specified in section 88 of the Incometax Act is presently allowable to all individuals and HUFs, as an incentive for retaining a part of their earnings in the form of savings."
13961,2002-03,"Taxpayers in the higher tax brackets, however, do not require fiscal incentives to save through the various designated instruments."
13962,2002-03,"I therefore propose to allow the rebate at the existing rate of 20% only to persons having taxable income upto Rs 1,50,000."
13963,2002-03,"Persons having taxable income between Rs 1,50,000 and Rs 5 lakhs will henceforth get a rebate of only 10% of the amount invested, and no rebate will be allowed where taxable income exceeds Rs 5 lakhs."
13964,2002-03,"The special rebate of 30% for persons having taxable salary income upto Rs 1 lakh will, however, continue."
13965,2002-03,"Further, while the existing limits on the qualifying amounts of investment will remain, I propose to provide a clarification in the law that the rebate will be allowed on investments made at any time during the year, as long as the amount invested is less than the taxable income of the year."
13966,2002-03,"Presently, tax exemption is available to certain categories of employees receiving amounts upto"
13967,2002-03,Rs 5 lakhs as VRS compensation.
13968,2002-03,I propose to extend this exemption to employees of certain institutions of national or Statelevel importance to be notified in this behalf.
13969,2002-03,I am also making some procedural changes which are included in the Finance Bill.
13970,2002-03,"A Scheme called “Sampark” is being launched by the Income Tax Department, which will enable taxpayers to obtain information and forms through the Internet."
13971,2002-03,Userfriendly software will be made available by the Department to enable taxpayers to prepare their returns of income.
13972,2002-03,Effective use of information technology will depend critically on strict compliance with the requirements relating to permanent account number PAN.
13973,2002-03,"I propose to make a specific provision in the Incometax Act for imposing a penalty of Rs 10,000 in all cases where a false PAN is quoted in documents relating to specified transactions."
13974,2002-03,"In 1998, I had prescribed certain highvalue transactions such as purchase or sale of motorcars and expenditure incurred in hotels and restaurants, in which the permanent account number is to be compulsorily quoted."
13975,2002-03,"I propose to extend this list of transactions provided in rule 114B of the Incometax Rules to include expenditure exceeding Rs 25,000 incurred in cash on foreign travel, purchase of bank drafts exceeding Rs 50,000 in cash and making cash deposits exceeding Rs 50,000 in any bank account."
13976,2002-03,I further propose to introduce rules to provide that any transaction specified in rule 114B which is incurred in cash must be reported within a certain period to the Incometax Department.
13977,2002-03,"Sir, I have already stated that national security is an overriding concern."
13978,2002-03,Its cost has to be shared by all of us.
13979,2002-03,"I therefore propose to impose a modest surcharge of 5% acrosstheboard on all categories of taxpayers, except individuals and Hindu Undivided Families having total income upto Rs 60,000."
13980,2002-03,The 2% surcharge imposed last year in the wake of the Gujarat Earthquake is being abolished and hence the net additional impact would be only 3%.
13981,2002-03,I also propose to restrict the 100% deduction of 34 export profits allowed to certain units under sections 10A and 10B of the Incometax Act to a 90% deduction for the assessment year 20032004.
13982,2002-03,"To sum up, Sir, my proposals made in this Budget on the Direct Taxes will result in a revenue gain of Rs 6,000 crore, including the component of surcharge of Rs 2,750 crore."
13983,2002-03,"I estimate that the direct tax revenue in 20022003 would be Rs 91,585 crore."
13984,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these proposals I estimate total tax revenue receipts for the Centre at Rs 1,72,965 crore and the fiscal deficit at Rs 1,35,524 crore or 5.3% of GDP."
13985,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker Sir, this is a budget for consolidating, widening and deepening the reform process."
13986,2002-03,This is a budget devoted to development.
13987,2002-03,This is a budget to further promote partnership with the States for a better tomorrow for the people of India.
13988,2002-03,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, with these words, I commend the budget to this august house."
13989,2003-04,"I am greatly honoured to present the sixth successive budget of the Government of the National Democratic Alliance NDA, under the premiership of Shri Atal Behari Vajpayee."
13990,2003-04,"I wish to place on record high appreciation of my distinguished predecessor, Shri Yashwant Sinha, who so ably steered the country’s finances in the earlier budgetary exercises."
13991,2003-04,That has made my task so much easier today.
13992,2003-04,THE CHALLENGE AND THE RESPONSE 3.
13993,2003-04,At the core of our economic endeavour and management of the country’s finances are the interests of our citizens; all this effort is for their total well being.
13994,2003-04,"That is our central objective, towards which the NDA government has a nonnegotiable commitment."
13995,2003-04,"Through Budget 20032004, the Government, therefore, addresses the following five objectives, as ‘Panch Priorities’, for our citizens and for the economic security of our country, though these are not listed in any hierarchial order of importance: a poverty eradication; addressing the ‘life time concerns’ of our citizens, covering health, housing, education and employment; b infrastructure development; c fiscal consolidation through tax reforms and progressive elimination of budgetary drags, including reform of the additional excise duty, introduction of service tax, and introduction of Value Added Tax VAT from April 1, 2003 at the State level."
13996,2003-04,Permit me to share the conceptual underpinning of these ‘panch priorities’.
13997,2003-04,"Let us, to start with readily acknowledge that the essential entrepreneurial character and the creative genius of our citizens is our greatest asset."
13998,2003-04,This energy has to be released.
13999,2003-04,"For that, and for converting the liability of want into the asset of ability, eradication of poverty is crucial; that is the moral and economic issue of our times."
14000,2003-04,"Too often it is observed that budgetary exercises float over the wide mass of India, relating only to a few."
14001,2003-04,This is not so here.
14002,2003-04,And that is why a closely interrelated concern is renewed progress on the front of agriculture; our nation’s life blood.
14003,2003-04,"A second revolution, to follow the earlier Green Revolution is the vital need of today."
14004,2003-04,"But neither in agriculture, nor in industry, shall we be able to attain our objective, if infrastructure, both physical and social, is not rapidly and efficiently developed."
14005,2003-04,"For this, private and public interest must combine so as to generate maximum social welfare."
14006,2003-04,"Upon these foundations, and through encouraging specific manufacturing sectors, particularly activities where knowledge is industry, we will enhance growth, improve incomes, generate employment and promote exports."
14007,2003-04,"For our growth to be sustained, fiscal consolidation is the basis; it is the central pillar."
14008,2003-04,"Government has to totally eliminate budgetary drags, and be rid of the selflaid traps; they retard both the pace and the robustness of our growth."
14009,2003-04,"What is needed is a continuous and selfreliant progression of accelerating, all round growth, with a wider distributive spread of national wealth and greater spending power in the hands of all our citizens."
14010,2003-04,"We have to recognise the need to address a reduction of not just our social but economic inequalities, too."
14011,2003-04,This cannot be postponed.
14012,2003-04,That is why reforms are so critical.
14013,2003-04,"And, our reform agenda must not be held hostage; either to yesterday’s debates, or to subjective and selective interpretations of it."
14014,2003-04,"This is a collective need, for the nation’s growth, which all of us have to address together."
14015,2003-04,"The nation can not afford the luxury of prolonged periods of reflection, or a leisurely implementation schedule."
14016,2003-04,The world will otherwise pass us by.
14017,2003-04,"Beyond deregulation, it is more and ever more debureaucratisation that is needed, as much of systems as of the mind."
14018,2003-04,"Of course, institutions matter, correct design and application of rules, too, but all in the service of our national objectives; not either as obtuse abstractions or as partisan goals."
14019,2003-04,The core need in the country is of releasing national creativity.
14020,2003-04,"The Budget 20032004, of the NDA Government endeavours to do just that."
14021,2003-04,This is our economic and social compact.
14022,2003-04,I want to now briefly share with Hon’ble Members the backdrop in which we address our responsibilities.
14023,2003-04,"The circumstances in which we meet are defined by the current global uncertainties; their vortex lies over the Gulf, and Iraq is at the very core of it, even as the IsraelPalestine conflict smoulders."
14024,2003-04,"Vast naval armadas crowd the waters of the North Arabian Sea, and land and air forces prepare for battle."
14025,2003-04,"Nearer, our neighbour Afghanistan, torn by decades’ old violence, continues to struggle with postTaliban tremors."
14026,2003-04,"In NorthEast Asia, old animosities are flared to near criticality through 3 irresponsible external assistance."
14027,2003-04,"And, our immediate western neighbour, riven internally by multiple fault lines, spews venomous terrorism from the cauldron of its compulsive hostility for India."
14028,2003-04,"Despite all this, and despite the present volatility in international oil prices, alongside a continuing sluggishness in global recovery, uncertain markets, a 9 month long military standoff on our borders; the simultaneous challenge of combating externally aided and abetted terrorism; and the worst drought that we have faced in three decades; objectively, the country’s macroeconomic circumstances have never been better for attaining our developmental objectives of enhanced and sustainable growth, poverty eradication, employment generation, and improving the quality of life."
14029,2003-04,Economic performance: 200203 10.
14030,2003-04,"Sir, the overall economic performance in 200203 has been reported in detail in the Economic Survey."
14031,2003-04,"I do not wish to repeat all that except to highlight that despite the agricultural GDP decline of an estimated 3.1 per cent, caused entirely by a large decline in crop output, the country, registered a real growth of 4.4 per cent in GDP, net of inflation."
14032,2003-04,"Growth rates of industry 6.1 per cent and services 7.1 per cent accelerated very encouragingly, as did exports by a healthy 20.4 per cent."
14033,2003-04,"From 1956 onward, continuously, we have endured serious foreign exchange constraints."
14034,2003-04,"After a gap of 24 years, our current account turned into a surplus in 200102, and continued to be in surplus during the first two quarters of the current year."
14035,2003-04,"Our reserves’ build up during the last year has been the highest ever in a single year, with reserves crossing $75.5 billion in the third week of February."
14036,2003-04,"In earlyFebruary, the Government decided to prepay $3 billion of its external loans."
14037,2003-04,"India is now an exporter of grain to 15 countries, and donor of hard currency aid to a dozen, alongwith rupee aid to another dozen countries."
14038,2003-04,"The rupee, with foreign assets to currency ratio of 124.8 per cent, is stable."
14039,2003-04,"Gross domestic savings, as a proportion of GDP at market prices, have also improved and stand at around 24 per cent."
14040,2003-04,"In the course of the last four years, our interest rates on Government securities, have rapidly gone down from 12 to around 7 per cent, thus setting the stage for growth of investment."
14041,2003-04,The Tenth Fiveyear Plan 12.
14042,2003-04,"The National Development Council, in December 2002, approved the Tenth Five Year Plan, with a bold and ambitious target of 8 per cent annual growth on the average."
14043,2003-04,One of the crucial aims of the Tenth Plan is to promote a balanced and equitable regional development and to advance the necessary policy and administrative reforms at the State level.
14044,2003-04,"The allocation for 200304 includes several additional initiatives such as promoting infrastructure by leveraging public money through private sector partnership, provision of 2 lakh handpumps in waterscarcity areas and schools, rejuvenation of 1 lakh traditional water sources in villages, research and development R&D support in pharmaceuticals, wind and solar energy, among others."
14045,2003-04,"Permit me, Sir, to now address the ‘Panch Priorities’."
14046,2003-04,ANTYODAYA AND LIFETIME CONCERNS Antyodaya Anna Yojana 14.
14047,2003-04,"For eliminating poverty, it is only reforms that result in sustained growth and high employment that are the durable solution."
14048,2003-04,"However, given our comfortable food stock, there is both scope and a need for a direct attack, too."
14049,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I am sure you agree that the disadvantaged must always be the first charge on our exchequer."
14050,2003-04,"This is our belief, it is our creed; this is also at the heart of ‘integral humanism’."
14051,2003-04,"Therefore, it has been decided, and I want this to be the first announcement that is made, that the Antyodaya Anna Yojana will be expanded from April 1, 2003, to cover an additional 50 lakh families raising the total coverage to more than a quarter of all BPL families during the year 200304."
14052,2003-04,The additional budgetary expenditure on this account will be Rs 507 crore.
14053,2003-04,"Sir, may I, in humility, say that this does cover the first part of my assurance: “Garib ke pet me dana,....”."
14054,2003-04,"Rural development, rural industries and artisans, and poverty alleviation in urban areas are addressed severally through various schemes in different ministries."
14055,2003-04,"A need has, therefore, been felt for sometime that all these schemes, of the same genre, be rationalised."
14056,2003-04,"To do that, a Committee headed by the Deputy Chairman, Planning Commission, is proposed."
14057,2003-04,"It will examine all schemes having a bearing on poverty alleviation and rural development, and recommend their practical convergence."
14058,2003-04,"The Prime Minister had on Independence Day, 2002, announced the Government’s commitment to improving national wellbeing by addressing the ‘life time concerns’ of our citizens, a noble and holistic objective."
14059,2003-04,"Of these, I take housing first."
14060,2003-04,It is a basic necessity.
14061,2003-04,"While promoting the all important employmentgenerating activity of construction, it also stimulates demand for core industries like steel and cement."
14062,2003-04,"To maintain its present momentum of growth, it is proposed that interest deductible under income tax up to Rs 1,50,000, for construction or purchase of a selfoccupied house property, be continued."
14063,2003-04,"In addition, it is proposed that income from housing projects for construction of residential units, of prescribed specification, approved by the local authorities up to March 31, 2005, will now be exempt from income tax."
14064,2003-04,"Thus, not only has the limitation with regard to the year of sanction, earlier frozen at March 31, 2001, now been extended, but the benefits of the scheme also made available irrespective of the year of completion."
14065,2003-04,"The Finance Ministry is further examining what additional incentives can be given to basic infrastructural developments that must accompany slum upgradation, sewerage system laying and greenfield housing projects."
14066,2003-04,Education is the central vein of our ‘lifetime concerns’.
14067,2003-04,"Therefore, at the level of the citizen taxpayers, as a first step education expenses up to Rs 12,000 per 5 child for two children, will be made eligible for rebate under Section 88 of the Income Tax Act."
14068,2003-04,"India is a highly creative, knowledgebased society; but authorship of books has never been sufficiently rewarded, certainly not monetarily."
14069,2003-04,"Therefore, royalty income up to Rs 3 lakh per annum, received by authors of literary, artistic and scientific books shall henceforth be fully exempt; as will be royalty received by individuals from exploitation of patents."
14070,2003-04,This is in addition to the other existing exemption benefits.
14071,2003-04,"I declare, Mr. Speaker, a possible, personal benefit here as an author of some books, with variable but always modest royalty income."
14072,2003-04,"There, however, is no conflict of interest, Sir, because this measure has not been announced with any personal benefit in mind."
14073,2003-04,"Games and sports are a necessity, as much for recreation as for developing sound bodies and minds."
14074,2003-04,"But, for a nation of a billion plus, sports facilities available to our young are woefully inadequate."
14075,2003-04,"Therefore, development of sports infrastructure will now be supported through direct funding of publicprivate joint initiatives."
14076,2003-04,Guidelines in this regard will be issued shortly.
14077,2003-04,"With three principal objectives in mind: to contribute to enhanced national health; to promote India as a global health destination; and to enable easier access to health facilities to our disadvantaged citizens, a number of additional measures are now proposed."
14078,2003-04,"In order to encourage private hospitals to either establish new or to expand existing medical facilities, it is proposed to extend the benefit of Section 1023 G of IT Act to such financial institutions as provide longterm capital to private hospitals with 100 beds or more."
14079,2003-04,"In view of the rapid strides made in R&D in medical equipment, there is recognisable need to frequently upgrade and replace the existing equipment with the more ‘state of the art’."
14080,2003-04,"It is therefore, proposed to increase the rate of depreciation from the present 25 per cent to 40 per cent in respect of life saving medical equipment."
14081,2003-04,"To assist citizens with impaired vision, the basic customs and excise duties on rough ophthalmic blanks shall be reduced from 25 to 5 per cent, and from 16 to 8 per cent, respectively."
14082,2003-04,"To help people give up their addiction to tobacco and its products, excise duty on Nicotin Polacrilex gum shall be reduced from 16 to 8 per cent."
14083,2003-04,"It is also proposed to reduce the customs duty on specified life saving equipment from 25 per cent to 5 per cent, and also exempt them from CVD additional duty of customs."
14084,2003-04,"In respect of life saving equipment already exempt from CVD, it is proposed to exempt them from excise duty as well, so as to encourage indigenous manufacturers."
14085,2003-04,A large number of life saving drugs are either exempt from customs duty or attract a nominal 5 per cent duty.
14086,2003-04,It is proposed to extend the concessional duty rate of 5 per cent to some more drugs.
14087,2003-04,Life saving drugs currently attracting nil or 5 per 6 cent customs duty will also be exempt from excise duty.
14088,2003-04,"Basic customs duty on glucometers and glucometer strips used by diabetics, will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent; and they will be exempt from excise duty as well."
14089,2003-04,Cyclosporine will be exempted from excise duty.
14090,2003-04,"This reduction of excise duty to nil, wherever imports are exempt from CVD, will certainly make our domestic industry more competitive, as also better enable them to face the new intellectual property right regime from 2005."
14091,2003-04,"For a large majority of our less advantaged citizens, easy access to good health services is just not there."
14092,2003-04,"In order to correct this and offer health protection, of some choice, the public sector general insurance companies have been encouraged to design a communitybased universal health insurance scheme during 200304."
14093,2003-04,"Under this scheme, a premium equivalent to Re.1 per day or Rs 365 per year for an individual, Rs 1.50 per day for a family of five, and Rs 2 per day for a family of seven, will entitle eligibility to get reimbursement of medical expenses up to Rs 30,000 towards hospitalisation, a cover for death due to accident for Rs 25,000, and compensation due to loss of earning at the rate of Rs 50 per day up to a maximum of 15 days."
14094,2003-04,"To make the scheme affordable to BPL families, the Government has decided to contribute Rs 100 per year towards their annual premium."
14095,2003-04,Full details will be publicized shortly.
14096,2003-04,I request Hon’ble Members to give this scheme the widest possible coverage in their constituencies.
14097,2003-04,"The benefits Sir, are real."
14098,2003-04,"In the first phase, at least an additional 50 lakh BPL families will be covered during 200304."
14099,2003-04,"The Government is committed to providing equal opportunities, protection of rights, and allround development of persons with disabilities."
14100,2003-04,A number of initiatives have already been taken in this regard.
14101,2003-04,"Now, for income tax purposes, it is proposed that the physically handicapped or persons with such dependents be entitled to a deduction for permanent physical disability of Rs 50,000, and an enhanced deduction of Rs 75,000 in case of severe disability."
14102,2003-04,"I also propose to reduce the customs duty on hearing aids, crutches, wheel chairs, walking frames, tricycles, braillers and artificial limbs to 5 per cent without Special Additional Duty SAD."
14103,2003-04,"They will be exempt from CVD, and the domestic manufacturers will also be exempt from excise duty."
14104,2003-04,I also propose to reduce the customs duty on parts of hearing aids and wheel chairs to 5 per cent without CVD and SAD.
14105,2003-04,"The Government will establish a college of rehabilitation sciences at Gwalior, and a national institute for empowerment of persons with multiple disabilities at Chennai."
14106,2003-04,A constant refrain of the salaried has been limited standard deduction for income tax purposes.
14107,2003-04,It is asserted that as a group they consistently demonstrate 7 the best tax compliance.
14108,2003-04,"I agree, they do."
14109,2003-04,"It is, therefore, proposed that the standard deduction for such employees be raised to 40 per cent of salary, or Rs 30,000, whichever is less, for salary income up to Rs 5 lakh; and allow a deduction of Rs 20,000 for salary income above Rs 5 lakh."
14110,2003-04,"It is also proposed that relief be provided to employees opting for voluntary retirement scheme VRS, by exempting VRS payments up to Rs 5 lakh, even when taken in instalments."
14111,2003-04,The Government will restore the Leave Travel Concession LTC facility to its employees.
14112,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, permit me to hope that the consequential additional outgo from the exchequer on this account, will at least benefit some in our tourism industry."
14113,2003-04,Senior citizens and pensioners 39.
14114,2003-04,India will shortly become home to the second largest number of elderly persons in the world.
14115,2003-04,"The population of our elderly, at present estimated at 76 million, is expected to increase to 100 million in 2013."
14116,2003-04,"The interests of the pensioners and senior citizens are, therefore, a particular responsibility of the NDA Government."
14117,2003-04,"To enable them to live their life of retirement in dignity, the tax rebate to senior citizens is proposed to be increased to Rs 20,000."
14118,2003-04,"As a result, their income up to Rs 1.53 lakh will henceforth become fully exempt from income tax."
14119,2003-04,"In the case of senior citizens on pension, the effective exemption limit may hereafter be actually higher and become Rs 1.83 lakh, because of standard deduction."
14120,2003-04,They can get further relief by taking advantage of the tax rebate available under Section 88.
14121,2003-04,"In addition, to reduce their cost of compliance, but of much greater importance to them – to reduce bureaucratic hassles – I propose to accept selfdeclarations filed by our senior citizens, in regard to no deduction of tax at source from interest income, income from units, and such other sources."
14122,2003-04,"Nevertheless, in the context of the declining rates of interest, I do take on board the difficulties that are often voiced and could be faced by our senior citizens and others."
14123,2003-04,"In order to provide relief to them, the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC will launch a special pension policy, guaranteeing an annual return of 9 per cent, in the form of a monthly pension scheme."
14124,2003-04,"This scheme will be called: Varishtha Pension Bima Yojana, through which a pensioner, or any citizen above 55 years of age, could on payment of a lumpsum amount get benefits calculated at 9 per cent per annum."
14125,2003-04,"For this scheme, and with pensions in mind, any citizen above the age of 55 years of age will qualify, and will get a monthly return in the form of a pension for life."
14126,2003-04,"Upon demise, the initial amount deposited will be returned to the spouse/nominee under the policy."
14127,2003-04,"The minimum and maximum monthly pensions proposed are Rs 250 and Rs 2,000 per month."
14128,2003-04,This monthly pension will start from the month following the payment of the lumpsum amount by the citizen.
14129,2003-04,"The difference between the actual yield earned by the LIC, on the funds invested under the scheme, and the assured return of 9 per cent, will be reimbursed to the LIC annually, by the Government."
14130,2003-04,Other details of this scheme will be announced shortly by the LIC.
14131,2003-04,"For exservicemen, whose welfare is so close to my heart, I propose to grant income tax exemption to corporations set up under a Central or State Act for their benefit."
14132,2003-04,"It is a matter of great personal satisfaction to me, that of the Prime Minister’s scheme for establishing 227 exservicemen medical XSM facilities in the country, the first will be inaugurated in April this year."
14133,2003-04,The Ministry of Finance fully supports this scheme.
14134,2003-04,"My predecessor in office had, in 2001, announced a road map for a restructured pension scheme for new Central Government employees, and a scheme for the general public."
14135,2003-04,This scheme is now ready.
14136,2003-04,"It will apply only to new entrants to Government service, except to the armed forces, and upon finalisation, offer a basket of pension choices."
14137,2003-04,"It will also be available, on a voluntary basis, to all employers for their employees, as well as to the selfemployed."
14138,2003-04,"This new pension system, when introduced, will be based on defined contribution, shared equally in the case of Government employees between the Government and the employees."
14139,2003-04,"There will, of course, be no contribution from the Government in respect of individuals who are not Government employees."
14140,2003-04,"The new pension scheme will be portable, allowing transfer of the benefits in case of change of employment, and will go into ‘individual pension accounts’ with Pension Funds."
14141,2003-04,The Ministry of Finance will oversee and supervise the Pension Funds through a new and independent Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority.
14142,2003-04,V. PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE 4 6 .
14143,2003-04,I now come to the second of the ‘panch priorities’ – physical infrastructure.
14144,2003-04,Demand generated by enhanced public investment in infrastructure has been a key stimulant underlying our current industrial recovery.
14145,2003-04,"In October 1998, the Prime Minister launched the National Highway Development Project NHDP, one of the most ambitious highway projects in the world, providing strong backward linkages for our steel and cement industries."
14146,2003-04,"There is simply no alternative to providing quality roads, railroads, ports, airports, reliable and reasonably priced power supply, safe drinking water and sanitation."
14147,2003-04,Without these India can not take full advantage of the opportunities now offered by technology and competition.
14148,2003-04,"In developing infrastructure, there is need to encourage publicprivate partnership, so that public funds are leveraged, and the quality of service delivery improved, thus yielding better value for money."
14149,2003-04,"Accordingly, Budget 200304 undertakes to provide a major thrust to infrastructure, principally to roads, railways, airports, and seaports, through innovative funding mechanisms."
14150,2003-04,"This comprehensive initiative will cover the following:  48 new road projects at an estimated cost of around Rs 40,000 crore; with a quarter of them being made of cement concrete;  National Rail Vikas Yojana projects worth Rs 8,000 crore;  Renovation/modernisation of two airports, and two seaports at an estimated cost of Rs 11,000 crore; and 9  establishing two global standard international convention centres at an estimated cost of Rs 1,000 crore."
14151,2003-04,"The total estimated cost of the above projects is about Rs 60,000 crore."
14152,2003-04,"In addition, the NorthSouth and EastWest corridors will be funded through the additional levy of a cess of 50 paise per liter of diesel and motor spirit."
14153,2003-04,"This levy will contribute a further Rs 2,600 crore for road development."
14154,2003-04,"The essence of the new funding mechanism is to leverage public money through private sector partnership, wherever possible."
14155,2003-04,"The three critical components of the scheme are: release of public funds only when linked to specific and well defined milestones in completion of the project, in physical terms; a sharing of the risks with the private promoters and financiers; and no openended Government guarantees at any stage."
14156,2003-04,"These 48 projects, with a total length of over 10,000 kms., are over and above the NHDP."
14157,2003-04,They have been identified where the traffic volume justifies four laning.
14158,2003-04,"These projects will be funded on a buildoperateandtransfer BOT basis, with the Government providing a subsidy in the form of an annuity flow to meet only the shortfall between anticipated revenue and loan repayment liabilities."
14159,2003-04,"In the first year, 200304, at least 3,000 kms., of roads, or almost a third of the total of these 48 projects, will be taken up for fourlaning."
14160,2003-04,National Rail Vikas Yojana 5 2 .
14161,2003-04,"Ministry of Railways has established a special purpose vehicle SPV to take up projects worth Rs 8,000 crore for the Golden Quadrilateral."
14162,2003-04,"Their projects will be funded through Rs 3,000 crore worth of equity, provided by the Government, and Rs 5,000 crore worth of loans."
14163,2003-04,This SPV will raise debt from the market.
14164,2003-04,Repayment of debt will be done by earmarking Railway receipts over the period of amortisation.
14165,2003-04,"Further, safety upgradation programme on the Golden Quadrilateral will be taken up simultaneously under this mechanism."
14166,2003-04,"In addition to the existing initiatives for leasing of major airports, as well as of setting up two private airports in Bangalore and Hyderabad, it has now been decided to take up the Delhi and Mumbai airports, as the principal hubs of international travel to India, for modernisation to international standards."
14167,2003-04,Two separate companies will be formed with initial equal equity participation from the Airports Authority.
14168,2003-04,These two companies could also take joint venture partners.
14169,2003-04,"On completion, the management will be leased out."
14170,2003-04,"It is proposed to facilitate the implementation of comprehensive modernisation projects for Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust JNPT, Navi Mumbai and Cochin Port, designed to bring them up to international standards."
14171,2003-04,JNPT and Cochin ports need dredging and modernisation.
14172,2003-04,"These projects are expected to cost over Rs 7,500 crore."
14173,2003-04,"The user charges levied by the two port authorities, and the additional 10 custom flowing in after dredging and modernisation is completed, are expected to cover the debt service obligations."
14174,2003-04,"Here, too, the Government will provide only the viability gap funding to bridge any possible shortfall."
14175,2003-04,"To redress the lack of convention centres of international standards in the country, the Government will enable the establishment of two such centres through publicprivate partnership; with the Government covering the viability funding gaps only."
14176,2003-04,"For the 48 road projects, National Rail Vikas Yojana, the two airports, the two seaports, and the two convention centres, a sum of Rs 2,000 crore is being provided as initial contribution from the Government."
14177,2003-04,"On a flow basis, the average annual commitment for all these projects, under the viability gap funding basis, is expected to be around Rs 2,000 crore per annum in the mediumterm, to be met annually from the budgets of the Railways and the Government."
14178,2003-04,"Encouraged by the success of the scheme of funding rural roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana by earmarking 50 per cent of the cess on diesel, it is proposed that the resources for rural roads be augmented."
14179,2003-04,"Accordingly, apart from allocating the anticipated Rs 2,325 crore from the existing cess on diesel for 200304, additional funds will be made available for rural roads from the proposed additional cess on diesel of 50 paise."
14180,2003-04,"As Hon’ble Members know, the Electricity Bill, 2001 was introduced in the Lok Sabha in August, 2001 and subsequently referred to the Standing Committee on Energy for examination."
14181,2003-04,The report of this committee has been received.
14182,2003-04,"This Bill seeks to provide a legal framework for our reforms and restructuring of the power sector, also in simplification of administrative aspects."
14183,2003-04,We should take up this Bill now for early consideration.
14184,2003-04,"Simultaneous to the emphasis on improvement in power distribution, our attention on capacity addition remains."
14185,2003-04,"The Government had earlier, in 1999, notified 18 power projects as mega projects, conferring upon them various duty and licensing benefits."
14186,2003-04,The Government now proposes to liberalise the mega power project policy further by extending all these benefits to any power project that fulfills the conditions already prescribed for mega power projects.
14187,2003-04,"Given the importance of transmission in the power sector, it is proposed to reduce customs duty on specific equipment for high voltage transmission projects from 25 per cent to 5 per cent."
14188,2003-04,"To further research in solar energy, wind turbines, and hydrogen fuel as alternatives to fossil fuels, the Government is especially allocating Rs 20 crore to the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, for launching incentivedriven research in these three fields."
14189,2003-04,Supply of safe drinking water is an essential component of infrastructure development.
14190,2003-04,"Orders have been issued to grant depreciation at the rate of 100 per cent on plant and machinery, and buildings that house such plant and machinery, forming part of a water supply project or a water treatment system."
14191,2003-04,"Water supply projects are now totally exempt in regard to capital goods and machinery, both from customs and excise duties."
14192,2003-04,"In addition, pipes have been exempted from excise duty for bringing raw water from source to the treatment plant and for conveying treated water to the storage place."
14193,2003-04,I do hope that this will provide further incentive to new water treatment and supply projects for augmenting the supply of safe drinking water in the country.
14194,2003-04,FISCAL CONSOLIDATION AND DEBT RESTRUCTURING 63.
14195,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have already said that for our growth to be sustained fiscal consolidation is essential."
14196,2003-04,"The Government has nurtured macroeconomic stability – held inflation low, and maintained a strong balance of payments position – while promoting growth."
14197,2003-04,"It has done so not only in the face of an unprecedented drought, but also in a global economy where growth is ‘tepid’, uncertainty great, and oil prices high."
14198,2003-04,We have carefully balanced the need for fiscal consolidation with the need for a contracyclical policy stance.
14199,2003-04,"Simultaneously, as I said, Government is committed to totally eliminating budgetary drags, be rid of the selflaid traps; and go forward with fiscal consolidation through revenue enhancement under a modern tax administration, and expenditure rationalisation."
14200,2003-04,Appropriate cash management is integral to expenditure management.
14201,2003-04,"There is, at present, no effective cash management in our system as cash is available to the Ministries up to the budget ceiling as soon as the Appropriation Bill is passed by Parliament."
14202,2003-04,"The Government, therefore, now proposes to initiate cash management, on a pilot basis, in some major spending ministries, releasing budgetary allocations in a timesliced manner to permit convergence with available resources within the year."
14203,2003-04,"Monthly or quarterly cash limits, based on the actual requirements of the Ministries will be prescribed."
14204,2003-04,This will avoid mismatches between receipts and expenditure and avoid rush of expenditure and the associated possible waste of resources in the last quarter.
14205,2003-04,"At the Central level, interest payments in 200203 are estimated at Rs 115,663 crore, equivalent to 48.8 per cent of the Government’s revenue receipts."
14206,2003-04,The average interest rate on Government of India’s outstanding debt has come down from 11 per cent in 19992000 to 9.4 per cent in 200102.
14207,2003-04,"But, Mr. Speaker, because of the legacy of high cost debt from the past, this reduction in the interest cost is not enough; it does not keep pace with the decline in the market rates of interest."
14208,2003-04,"The Government has, therefore, already started to act on three fronts."
14209,2003-04,"First, taking advantage of our comfortable foreign exchange reserves and lower domestic interest rates, the Government has effected premature repayment of 12 ‘highcost’ currency pool loans of the World Bank, and of the Asian Development Bank totalling around $ 3 billion."
14210,2003-04,We intend to continue with this policy of prudently managing the external liabilities and of proactively liquidating relatively higher cost component of our external debt portfolio.
14211,2003-04,Domestic debt of the Central Government 6 7 .
14212,2003-04,"Second, a large proportion of the banks’ holding of Central Government domestic debt, contracted under the high interest regime of the past, is thinly traded."
14213,2003-04,"With the softening of interest rates, ordinarily, such loans should command a premium over their face value."
14214,2003-04,"In effect though, banks are often unable to encash this because of limited liquidity."
14215,2003-04,"The Government therefore, now proposes to offer a buy back of such loans – entirely on a voluntary basis – from banks that are in need of liquidity, or of encashing the premium for making provisions for their nonperforming assets NPAs thereby improving their balance sheets, or otherwise."
14216,2003-04,The premium to be offered will be set on a transparent basis.
14217,2003-04,"If the banks declare the premium received as business income, for income tax purposes, they will be allowed additional deduction to the extent such income is used for provisioning of their NPAs."
14218,2003-04,State Governments’ debt 6 8 .
14219,2003-04,"Third, is the restructuring of State Governments’ debt."
14220,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, the XII Finance Commission will also be making an assessment of the debt position of the States and suggest such corrective measures as are necessary."
14221,2003-04,"Meanwhile, the Central Government and the State governments have mutually agreed to introduce a debtswap scheme."
14222,2003-04,"Out of the total stock of debt of Rs 2,44,000 crore owed by the States to the Government of India, a little over Rs ,00,000 crore bear coupon rates in excess of 13 per cent per annum, a rate that is far in excess of the current market rates."
14223,2003-04,In consequence the interest burden of the States now constitutes a major item of expenditure for them; leaving little for even routine purposes.
14224,2003-04,"The debt swap scheme introduced by the Government of India will enable States to prepay high cost debt and substitute them by current, lowcouponbearing small savings and Open Market Loans."
14225,2003-04,"Twentysix of the twentyeight States have consented to participate in the scheme from the current year itself, while the remaining two States will join from 200304."
14226,2003-04,"Over a threeyear period ending in 200405, all State loans to the Government of India bearing coupons in excess of 13 per cent will have been swapped."
14227,2003-04,"In consequence, the States will save, at the very minimum, an estimated Rs 81,000 crore in interest, and deferred loan repayments, over the residual maturity period of the loans."
14228,2003-04,"Furthermore, and equally importantly, this scheme will restrain the debt buildup in States through the small savings scheme."
14229,2003-04,"Agriculture, the lifeblood of our economy, after giving the country adequate food security, is now again at the cross roads, as it prepares to diversify and move up the value chain."
14230,2003-04,It also needs to respond robustly to second generation issues such as land degradation and water logging.
14231,2003-04,"Diversification, resonance with market forces, and a swift adoption of sunrise technologies are the other needs."
14232,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, India has the largest irrigated, arable landmass in the world; our gross arable land being second only to the United States of America."
14233,2003-04,"We must acknowledge the vital import of these facts: they are both an unrecognized, and an unused asset; it is our great reserve."
14234,2003-04,We now need to give it full encouragement.
14235,2003-04,"Diversification into horticulture, floriculture, etc. 7 3 ."
14236,2003-04,"Promising gains from remunerative agricultural diversification into horticulture, this significant contributor to both GDP, and food and nutritional security, will have to be sustained."
14237,2003-04,"With this in view, during the current year, it is proposed to introduce a new Central Sector Scheme on Hitech Horticulture and Precision Farming."
14238,2003-04,"Major components of the scheme will be use of hitech interventions like fertigation, use of biotechnological tools, green food production, and hitech green houses."
14239,2003-04,"Deployment of precision farming technology aimed at judicious utilisation of resources like land, water, sunlight as well as time, including demonstration of these technologies will also be part of the scheme."
14240,2003-04,"I propose to provide, initially, a sum of Rs 50 crore under this scheme."
14241,2003-04,The state of the sugar industry is a matter of serious concern for the government.
14242,2003-04,"There is accumulation of stocks in factories, simultaneously with growing arrears of payment for cane supplied by farmers, partly in consequence of soft market conditions."
14243,2003-04,This has both economic and social consequences.
14244,2003-04,"In order to provide relief to both the farmers and industry, the Reserve Bank of India has already issued instructions to Cooperative Banks for the conversion of shortfall in margins into mediumterm working capital loans, subject of course, to their furnishing adequate security or State Government guarantees."
14245,2003-04,The Reserve Bank of India has also issued instructions to extend the repayment period of mediumterm loans to 9 years.
14246,2003-04,"In addition, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Finance will jointly address the problems of the sugar industry and propose a comprehensive scheme for this important agroindustry soon."
14247,2003-04,"Our plantation sector, a hundred and fifty year old agroindustry, is passing through a rough patch, because of price instability in international markets."
14248,2003-04,"The Government has already introduced a series of measures to provide relief to small and marginal farmers of plantation crops like tea, coffee and rubber, and help these sectors negotiate the difficult period."
14249,2003-04,"With a view to providing stability in terms of income for the small growers, from 200304 onwards, Government has announced a Price Stabilisation Fund of Rs 500 crore for the benefit of tea, coffee, and natural rubber growers."
14250,2003-04,The Fund will become operational in 200304.
14251,2003-04,"In addition, I propose to abolish the excise duty of Re. 1 per kg."
14252,2003-04,"This measure, Mr. Speaker, will not impose any additional burden on the tea industry, but it will redesign 14 the duty to help the industry."
14253,2003-04,"Further, coffee plantations will henceforth be eligible for income tax deduction of sums deposited in a development account, as in the case of tea."
14254,2003-04,Animal husbandry and veterinary medicine 78.
14255,2003-04,"India has the world’s largest cattle wealth; it produces more milk than any other country in the world, it has the second largest number of goats and third largest number of sheep in the world."
14256,2003-04,"In addition, animal husbandry provides employment to about 20 million, directly and indirectly."
14257,2003-04,But our livestock quality has deteriorated.
14258,2003-04,"Therefore to promote the health of our livestock and give a fillip to animal husbandry and dairying, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on specified veterinary drugs from 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
14259,2003-04,"To promote marine food industry, I propose to reduce the customs duty on shrimp larvae feed from 15 per cent to 5 per cent, and exempt it from CVD."
14260,2003-04,Timely availability of adequate credit is of utmost importance for the development of the rural economy and agriculture.
14261,2003-04,"At present Regional Rural Banks, commercial banks and credit cooperatives, encouraged mainly by the Government, undertake this function."
14262,2003-04,I am not satisfied with this arrangement.
14263,2003-04,We can not have a system wherein credit for motor cars is on easier terms than for farm equipment or tractors.
14264,2003-04,"Therefore, subject to the Reserve Bank of India’s prudential norms and approvals, private banks will hereafter be encouraged to open branches in rural areas, to service both farm and nonfarm sectors there."
14265,2003-04,"I will also examine afresh this whole question of franchising agricultural credit, including through Post Offices."
14266,2003-04,The full benefits of the declining rates of interest have not percolated to critical sectors such as agriculture and smallscale industry.
14267,2003-04,This has to be rectified.
14268,2003-04,"Therefore, in order to pass on the benefits of lower rates of interest to agriculture and the SSI sector, the State Bank of India has announced an interest rate band of 2 per cent above and below its prime lending rate PLR for secured advances."
14269,2003-04,The Indian Bank Association IBA is now advising all its member banks to adopt a similar interest rate band.
14270,2003-04,This is a welcome move.
14271,2003-04,Agriculture and SSI will hereafter have to pay no more than an extra 2 percentage points than the best bank customers.
14272,2003-04,"The SelfHelp Group SHGBank Linkage Programme being propagated by NABARD, for the last ten years, has been recognized as the largest and fastest growing microfinance programme in the world."
14273,2003-04,"Our expectations of providing bank credit to 1.25 lakh SHGs during the current year have been surpassed once again, and by January 2003, bank credit of Rs 598 crore has already been provided to about 25 lakh poor families through 1.50 lakh new SHGs."
14274,2003-04,The programme has also set in motion the process of women empowerment.
14275,2003-04,"However, the spread of the programme across the country has been uneven and has largely remained confined to a few States."
14276,2003-04,I urge all States to vigorously join in our endeavour to make the SHGBank Linkage Programme a widespread success.
14277,2003-04,"Hon’ble Members no doubt appreciate that despite the grave uncertainties on the oil front, the Government has by and large absorbed the crude price rise."
14278,2003-04,"Therefore, the issue price of fertilizers will be raised by a modest amount of Rs 12 for urea, and Rs 10 for DAP and MOP, per 50 kg bag."
14279,2003-04,The price of complex fertilizers will also be suitably modified.
14280,2003-04,Water management and irrigation Drip irrigation 83.
14281,2003-04,The recent drought again brings into sharp focus the need for conserving our water resources.
14282,2003-04,A number of initiatives have already been taken to conserve land and water resources.
14283,2003-04,States are also encouraged to promote drip and sprinkler irrigation through supply of equipment at subsidized rates.
14284,2003-04,But these efforts have to be intensified.
14285,2003-04,"Therefore, a bipartisan Task Force, headed by the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, and with a Minister of Agriculture from another State, as one of the members, will be constituted to recommend measures needed to be adopted firstly, to expand the coverage of such irrigation, thereafter to also suggest safeguards so that the intended benefits actually reach the target groups."
14286,2003-04,"Despite major developments in the water resource sector since Independence, the country has not really come out of the flooddroughtflood syndrome."
14287,2003-04,"This is principally on account of, among other reasons, three major factors: faulty water management practices, unbalanced development of irrigation sources in the country, and a highly uneven distribution of water resources."
14288,2003-04,"To expedite the proposal for interlinking of rivers, the Prime Minister has appointed a Task Force, which will suggest modalities for arriving at a consensus amongst the States on transfer of water to deficit areas and for identifying the priority links which could be implemented early, as well as a mechanism for their clearance and funding."
14289,2003-04,Adequate outlay is being provided to support this Task Force.
14290,2003-04,"A special programme, Maru Gochar Yojana, is proposed to be taken up for the desert districts of Rajasthan."
14291,2003-04,"This programme will provide for rehabilitation of traditional pastures – ‘Oran’ or ‘Gauchar’ – by developing at least one large pasturage nursery in each of the identified districts, as a Central scheme, for restoration of traditional water courses, and other measures so as to provide effective drought proofing."
14292,2003-04,A Task Force will be established for working out modalities for its implementation.
14293,2003-04,"Rupees 100 crore will be provided for this purpose, over a period of three years, with only a quarter of the contribution coming from the State Government."
14294,2003-04,Provision for 200304 for this purpose will be Rs 50 crore.
14295,2003-04,"As Hon’ble Members know, in the current year so far, industry has stimulated overall growth, despite a decline in agriculture."
14296,2003-04,"We must, therefore, consolidate these gains and build on the robust industrial growth demonstrated in the last few quarters."
14297,2003-04,Promoting investment: tax treatment of dividends and capital gains 88.
14298,2003-04,"For this, we need to promote investment in the industrial sector, and improve the debt and equity markets."
14299,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, I am also committed to bringing the small investors back to the equity markets by restoring their confidence."
14300,2003-04,"From April 1, 2003, it is proposed that dividends be tax free in the hands of the shareholders."
14301,2003-04,"Correspondingly, there will be a 12.5 per cent dividend distribution tax on domestic companies."
14302,2003-04,"While mutual funds, including UTIII, renamed UTI Mutual Fund, will also pay dividend distribution tax, it is proposed to exempt equity oriented schemes from the purview of the tax for one year."
14303,2003-04,"UTII, however, will be exempt from the dividend distribution tax."
14304,2003-04,Longterm capital gains tax 90.
14305,2003-04,"In order to give a further fillip to the capital markets, it is now proposed to exempt all listed equities that are acquired on or after March 1, 2003, and sold after the lapse of a year, or more, from the incidence of capital gains tax."
14306,2003-04,"Long term capital gains tax will, therefore, not hereafter apply to such transactions."
14307,2003-04,This proposal should facilitate investment in equities.
14308,2003-04,"I will, however, reexamine the effects of this exemption in the next Budget, and the Scheme will be in force until then."
14309,2003-04,My predecessor had already announced that stock exchanges will have a corporate structure.
14310,2003-04,"To enable this, necessary amendments to the Securities Control and Regulation Act will be proposed in the current session."
14311,2003-04,"With a view to enhancing investor confidence, it is necessary to separate the ownership of these stock exchanges from their management; resulting in demutualisation."
14312,2003-04,"In the process of corporatisation or demutualisation, it is possible that capital gains accrue."
14313,2003-04,"Therefore, as a one time measure, at the time of corporatisation or demutualisation of the stock exchanges, in accordance with a scheme approved by the SEBI, should gains arise, then the consequential transactions shall be fully exempt from capital gains tax."
14314,2003-04,"Hon’ble members, as I have already said, knowledge is industry; and this is particularly so when our imperative is to be the best, in all aspects in general, but particularly in product design and quality."
14315,2003-04,"To encourage R&D, it is proposed to extend the tax holiday to R&D companies established up to March 31, 2004."
14316,2003-04,"In industry, textiles is the largest employment provider in the country."
14317,2003-04,It also contributes substantially to our exports.
14318,2003-04,"The main thrust of my proposals for the textile sector, therefore, is to have a moderate rate structure; to complete the CENVAT chain to promote compliance; to encourage modernisation; and, to eliminate evasion."
14319,2003-04,"Keeping these objectives in view, as a package of incentives, the following measures are proposed:"
14320,2003-04,The procedure for the decentralized sector will be simplified so as to exempt job workers from maintaining any central excise records or even from central excise registration.
14321,2003-04,"Garments and fabrics manufactured by nonprofit charitable institutions will, however, be exempt from excise duty."
14322,2003-04,"As for customs, the duty on apparel grade raw wool shall now be reduced from 15 per cent to 5 per cent."
14323,2003-04,"Further, to encourage modernisation of the textile industry, it is proposed that the customs duty on a large number of textile machinery and their parts be reduced from the existing 25 per cent to just 5 per cent."
14324,2003-04,"Simultaneously, it is necessary to give a helping hand to the powerlooms."
14325,2003-04,"For this decentralized sector, it is proposed to strengthen the existing programme for Induction of Technology in the Weaving Sector further by offering a ‘Powerloom Package for Modernisation’."
14326,2003-04,This package will have the following three features.
14327,2003-04,"First, the Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme will be enlarged to cover modernisation of powerlooms."
14328,2003-04,"Second, to create a better working environment and obtain higher productivity, a new Powerloom Workshed Scheme will be introduced by the Ministry of Textiles together with the State Governments."
14329,2003-04,Improvement of other infrastructure of existing powerloom clusters will be taken up under the revised Textile Sector Infrastructure Development Scheme.
14330,2003-04,"Third, as a welfare measure, all powerloom workers will be covered under the Special Insurance Scheme, which will provide them insurance cover against death, accident and disability."
14331,2003-04,"Recognising the need to prevent sickness in the textile industry, Government is considering a mechanism for restructuring the debt portfolios of viable and potentially viable textile units."
14332,2003-04,The details will be decided in consultation with all the stake holders.
14333,2003-04,All the benefits listed under healthcare will also promote pharmaceutical industry.
14334,2003-04,"Besides, income tax concessions to pharmaceuticals, biotechnology and information technology are at par."
14335,2003-04,All drugs and materials imported or produced domestically for clinical trials will be exempt from customs and excise duties.
14336,2003-04,Customs 18 duty on import of Reference Standards by the industry has been reduced from 25 per cent to 5 per cent.
14337,2003-04,Information technology IT 1 0 2 .
14338,2003-04,IT is India’s showpiece success story.
14339,2003-04,"We have to not just maintain its momentum of growth, but continuously encourage it."
14340,2003-04,"Therefore, it is proposed that the concessions extended to IT under Sections 10A and 10B of the Income Tax Act will continue as originally envisaged."
14341,2003-04,As per law such companies as are currently covered by these tax exemptions lose the benefits upon change in their ownership or shareholding.
14342,2003-04,"I am, therefore, removing these restrictions; the benefit of such tax exemptions will remain even in the case of amalgamation or demerger."
14343,2003-04,Another anomaly is levy of excise duty on preloaded software in the case of computers.
14344,2003-04,"As software is already exempt from excise duty, I see no reason why this benefit should be denied simply because it gets loaded in a computer."
14345,2003-04,"From now, the value of preloaded software will be excluded for the purpose of charging excise duty on computers."
14346,2003-04,Customs duty on specified electronic components for IT industry is being reduced in conformity with our WTO commitment.
14347,2003-04,"In addition, customs duty on a number of capital goods used by the telecom and IT sector for manufacture of components will be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent."
14348,2003-04,"For optical fibre cables, used widely for networking to provide bandwidth to the IT community, the customs duty is also being reduced from 25 per cent to 20 per cent."
14349,2003-04,"To help the domestic industry to manufacture eglass roving used for making optical fibres, it is proposed to reduce the import duty on specified raw materials for the manufacture of eglass roving from 30 per cent to 15 per cent."
14350,2003-04,Telecom and domestic satellite service companies enjoy the benefit of tax holiday.
14351,2003-04,"Since it takes quite some time for such projects to materialize, I propose to extend the deadline of setting up the units by one more year to March 31, 2004."
14352,2003-04,"Biotech is our today’s sunrise, tomorrow’s showpiece industry."
14353,2003-04,"The Government, to facilitate units engaged in R&D in biotechnology and the pharmaceuticals sector, has decided to remove the existing restriction of minimum export obligation of Rs 20 crore for availing exemption from customs duty for specified equipments."
14354,2003-04,"Further, the restriction of full exemption being limited to only 1 per cent of last year’s export turnover is also lifted for R&D units."
14355,2003-04,"Moreover, in respect of R&D units with manufacturing facilities, the benefit of full customs duty exemption for specified equipment will also be available for their manufacturing activity to the extent of 25 per cent of the previous year’s export turnover."
14356,2003-04,"So far as benefits under direct taxes are concerned, biotech enjoys the same tax incentives as the IT or pharmaceuticals industry."
14357,2003-04,"Tourism, in addition to generating incomes, is amongst the most effective employment creating sectors."
14358,2003-04,"To provide a set of incentives to this industry, the following proposals will be implemented: a withdraw the expenditure tax; b extend the benefit of Section 1023G to financial institutions that advance longterm capital to hotels in threestar and above categories; c the benefit of setoff of unabsorbed loss and depreciation on amalgamation will henceforth be available to hotels under Section 72A of the Income Tax Act; d continue the exemption for the hotel industry from the levy of service tax; and e reduce basic customs duty on imported equipment for ropeway projects to 5 per cent without payment of CVD and SAD."
14359,2003-04,"It is our hope and expectation that the States, on their part, will now give a commensurate boost to the tourism sector by abolishing the luxury tax that they charge."
14360,2003-04,Gems and jewellery 1 1 1 .
14361,2003-04,"Traditionally, India has always excelled in the field of diamond and gem cutting, polishing and in the craft of gold smithy."
14362,2003-04,"With a view to nurturing this industry, it is proposed to reduce the customs duty on rough, coloured gem stones from 5 per cent, and on semiprocessed, halfcut or broken diamonds from 15 per cent to nil."
14363,2003-04,Customs duty on cut and polished diamonds and gem stones will also be reduced from the present 15 per cent to 5 per cent.
14364,2003-04,"As for gold, it is proposed to reduce the customs duty on imported gold to Rs 100 per 10 grams from the present level of Rs 250 per 10 grams, but only when it is brought in the form of serially numbered bars, or in the form of gold coins, not as ‘tola’ bars, please."
14365,2003-04,It is my hope and expectation that this will become the first step in enabling India to shortly emerge as the goldtrading capital of the world.
14366,2003-04,The gems and jewellery industry has also been quite apprehensive about withdrawal of benefits under Sections 10A and 10B of the Income Tax Act.
14367,2003-04,I would like to assure them that no such step is contemplated.
14368,2003-04,"Keeping in view the substantial value addition that takes place in the case of cutting and polishing of diamonds and gems, it is also proposed to extend the benefits under Sections 10A and 10B of the Income Tax Act to these activities."
14369,2003-04,Strengthening ECGC 1 1 4 .
14370,2003-04,Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd. ECGC has been playing a crucial role by providing credit insurance cover for exports from the country.
14371,2003-04,There is great potential for project exports from India with our exporters winning bids against intense international competition.
14372,2003-04,"In order to enable ECGC to provide adequate underwriting support to such projects, the Government has decided to increase its share capital to Rs 80 crore."
14373,2003-04,"A vibrant smallscale industry, contributing to both industrial and export growth, is critical for sustained growth in income and employment."
14374,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, as I have already said, the full benefits of the declining rates of interest have percolated neither to agriculture, nor to smallscale industry."
14375,2003-04,The recent announcement by the State Bank of India and the decision by the Indian Bank Association about an interest rate band of 2 per cent above and below PLR for secured advances will help the SSI sector in obtaining bank finance at moderate rates of interest.
14376,2003-04,"In addition, benefits and entitlements available to this sector shall be placed on the Ministry’s website, for ready reference."
14377,2003-04,"Accessing the global market with consumer goods of quality, at competitive prices, produced in both large and smallscale establishments operating under flexible conditions, is the goal that we need to target."
14378,2003-04,"Members will recall that last year, Government had announced the dereservation of over 50 items."
14379,2003-04,"After consultations with stakeholders in respect of certain other items in the reserved list, it is now proposed to withdraw SSI reservation from another 75 items of laboratory chemicals and reagents, leather and leather products, plastic products, chemicals and chemicals products and paper products."
14380,2003-04,The Minister of Small Scale Industries will announce the details of these items separately.
14381,2003-04,"To help further investment in the SSI sector, Government will examine the question of a limited partnership act."
14382,2003-04,Promoting India: India Development Initiative 1 1 7 .
14383,2003-04,"An initiative to promote India as both a production centre and an investment destination, called ‘India Development Initiative’, shall be established in the Ministry of Finance, with an allocation of Rs 200 crore for 200304."
14384,2003-04,This initiative will also leverage and promote our strategic economic interests abroad.
14385,2003-04,Disinvestment receipts for the current year are estimated at Rs 3360 crore.
14386,2003-04,I am confident that the pace of disinvestment will accelerate in the coming year.
14387,2003-04,"I wish to also state that details about the already announced Disinvestment Fund and Asset Management Company, to hold residual shares post disinvestment, shall be finalized early in 200304."
14388,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, disinvestment is not merely for mobilizing revenues for the Government, it is mainly for unlocking the productive potential of these undertakings, and for reorienting the Government, away from business and towards the business of governance."
14389,2003-04,OTHER REFORMS Banking 1 1 9 .
14390,2003-04,Foreign direct investment FDI in the banking companies in India is presently capped at 49 per cent from all sources under the automatic route.
14391,2003-04,"For facilitating the setting up of subsidiaries by foreign banks, as well as for inviting investment in private banks, this limit will be raised to at least 74 per cent."
14392,2003-04,The voting rights of any person holding shares of a banking company are restricted to 10 per cent irrespective of his/her shareholding.
14393,2003-04,"The Banking Regulation Act, 1949 will be amended to remove this limitation."
14394,2003-04,I now also extend the benefit of Sec.
14395,2003-04,Any banking company can now merge with a nationalized bank with consequential tax benefit.
14396,2003-04,"As the Hon’ble Members know, the Government is determined to contain the problem of nonperforming assets NPA and ensure a credit market that functions efficiently."
14397,2003-04,"Following the Budget announcement last year, the Credit Information Bureau has already been established."
14398,2003-04,It is proposed to provide the necessary legislative support to this Bureau.
14399,2003-04,Interest rate 1 2 3 .
14400,2003-04,"High rates of interest, in a low inflation regime, clearly act as disincentive to investment."
14401,2003-04,"It is, therefore, important that administered interest rates on public provident fund and other small saving schemes be adjusted in line with the market rates."
14402,2003-04,"Accordingly, rates of interest on public provident fund, and small savings schemes, etc. will be reduced by one percentage point with effect from March 1."
14403,2003-04,Interest on relief and savings bonds will also be reset accordingly.
14404,2003-04,"Hon’ble Members may, however, note that the real returns – adjusted for inflation – offered on these instruments are still a remunerative 6.3 per cent per year; higher than what they were between 199192 and 199596."
14405,2003-04,Capital account 1 2 4 .
14406,2003-04,"Over the last few months, Government has taken a number of steps to ease restrictions on capital account mobility."
14407,2003-04,"After careful assessment, I would like to announce the following additional steps: ♦ To enable diversification, overseas investment under the automatic route will be permitted to corporates with a proven track record, even where the investment is not in the same core activity."
14408,2003-04,"Further, the current restriction, limiting such investment to 50 per cent of the net worth of the Indian company, will now be raised to 100 per cent."
14409,2003-04,The Government is already considering a major review of sectoral limits for investments by Foreign Institutional Investors.
14410,2003-04,"In order to facilitate their easy entry into the stock markets, the process of their registration will be further streamlined."
14411,2003-04,Several steps have recently been taken to ease flows of Capital.
14412,2003-04,There will be more initiatives in this regard.
14413,2003-04,External aid 1 2 6 .
14414,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, a stage has come in our development where we should now, firstly, review our dependence on external donors."
14415,2003-04,"Second, extend support to the national efforts of other developing countries."
14416,2003-04,"And, thirdly, reexamine the line of credit route of international assistance to others."
14417,2003-04,"Having carefully weighed all aspects, I propose the following measures: a While being grateful to all our development partners of the past, I wish to announce that the Government of India would now prefer to provide 22 relief to certain bilateral partners, with smaller assistance packages, so that their resources can be transferred to specified nongovernmental organisations NGO’s in greater need of official development assistance."
14418,2003-04,"The current agreed programmes will, however, continue and reach their completion."
14419,2003-04,"Of course, there will be no more ‘tied aid’ any longer."
14420,2003-04,"For the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries HIPCs, owing overdue payments of substantial sums to India, I am happy to announce that we will be considering a debt relief package."
14421,2003-04,This will be announced shortly in consultation with the Ministry of External Affairs.
14422,2003-04,I am also happy to announce that the Government proposes to generally discontinue the practice of extending loans or credit lines to fellow developing countries.
14423,2003-04,"Instead, in future, I propose to utilize the ‘India Development Initiative’, which I have already announced, for providing grants or project assistance to developing countries in Africa, South Asia and other parts of the developing world."
14424,2003-04,Reform and reorganisation of the Ministry of Finance 1 2 7 .
14425,2003-04,"Responsibilities of the Department of Company Affairs, the Foreign Promotion Investment Board FIPB, and the regulation of the new Pension Funds Scheme have recently been added to the Ministry of Finance."
14426,2003-04,"There is, therefore, need to reorganize the Ministry, also to go back to the simpler and more direct name as the Ministry of Finance."
14427,2003-04,The Department of Company Affairs is now being absorbed as a Department – and will sadly no longer stand shoulder to shoulder with Finance.
14428,2003-04,"In the Ministry of Finance, the Department of Economic Affairs will be restructured and have separate divisions dealing with economic policy; analysis: international and national; capital markets; budget; banking; trade and aid concerns; and infrastructure and coordination."
14429,2003-04,"To remain better abreast of agriculture, an Expert Advisory Council, to advise the Ministry of Finance, will be set up for agriculture."
14430,2003-04,"X. TAX REFORM, REVISED ESTIMATES AND BUDGET ESTIMATES 1 3 0 ."
14431,2003-04,"I now come to taxes, tax reforms, and the bookkeeping of the current year, as also 200304."
14432,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, I want to emphasise six important aspects in this regard."
14433,2003-04,"First, the coming year will be historic with the States switching over to a Value Added Tax VAT."
14434,2003-04,"The Central Government has been a partner with the States, in the highest tradition of cooperative federalism, in this pathbreaking reform."
14435,2003-04,This will also involve an amendment to the Additional Excise Duty Act.
14436,2003-04,"Second, it is proposed to make 200304 the year when a longoverdue Constitutional amendment to integrate services into the tax net in a comprehensive manner is enacted and implemented."
14437,2003-04,"This will give a boost to revenues, and help implement VAT."
14438,2003-04,"Third, there will be major improvements in tax administration through greater application of IT, and a discretionfree, impersonal system."
14439,2003-04,"Fourth, excise duties are being 23 rationalised further."
14440,2003-04,"Fifth, the momentum of reducing customs duty is being maintained so as to improve the competitiveness of Indian industry in international markets."
14441,2003-04,"And, sixth, Government shall continue to strive towards fiscal consolidation through expenditure reprioritisation, and revenue augmentation."
14442,2003-04,Statelevel Value Added Tax VAT 1 3 1 .
14443,2003-04,"The Conference of State Chief Ministers, presided over by the Prime Minister, held on October 18, 2002 confirmed the final decision that all States and Union Territories would introduce VAT from April 2003."
14444,2003-04,"The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, on February 8, 2003, has again endorsed the suggestion that all State legislations on VAT should have a minimum set of common features."
14445,2003-04,"Apart from avoiding cascading of taxes, the introduction of VAT is expected to increase revenues as the coverage expands to value addition at all stages of sale in the production and distribution chain."
14446,2003-04,"However, in view of the apprehensions expressed by a large number of States, about possible revenue loss, in the initial years of introduction of VAT, the Central Government has agreed to compensate 100 per cent of the loss in the first year, 75 per cent of the loss in second year and 50 per cent of the loss in the third year of the introduction of VAT; this loss being computed on the basis of an agreed formula."
14447,2003-04,"The Government of India considers the introduction of VAT, at the State level, to be a historic reform of our domestic trade tax system, It will assist the States to transit successfully from the erstwhile sales tax system to a modern domestic system, at present in use in over 120 countries."
14448,2003-04,Additional excise duty AED in lieu of sales tax 1 3 3 .
14449,2003-04,"While continuing to give States the additional 1.5 per cent of all shareable taxes and duties, in order to enable them to generate more revenues, the Additional Duties of Excise Goods of Special Importance Act, 1957 is being amended, from a date to be notified."
14450,2003-04,"This will allow the States to levy sales tax on textiles, sugar and tobacco products at a rate not exceeding 4 per cent."
14451,2003-04,This will also enable the States to integrate these three important products in the VAT chain.
14452,2003-04,Service tax: a proposed Constitutional amendment 1 3 4 .
14453,2003-04,"To enable levy of tax on services as a specific and important source of revenue, an amendment to the Constitution is proposed."
14454,2003-04,"This Constitutional amendment, and the consequent legislation would give the Central Government the power to levy the tax and both the Central and the State Governments sufficient powers to collect the proceeds."
14455,2003-04,Central Sales Tax 1 3 5 .
14456,2003-04,"With the introduction of VAT, there is need to now phase out the CST, and move to a completely destinationbased system."
14457,2003-04,This can not be done in one step.
14458,2003-04,"We must let VAT stabilize; but also recognize that these two – VAT and CST – cannot remain in tandem, in perpetuity."
14459,2003-04,"Therefore, in the first instance, the ceiling rate of CST for interState sale between registered dealers will be reduced to 2 per cent during 200304, with effect from a date to be notified."
14460,2003-04,The Government of India will 24 compensate the States for loss of revenue from this reduction of the CST.
14461,2003-04,"This will be done, as all these steps have been undertaken, only after arriving at a consensus with the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers."
14462,2003-04,I do wish to place on record my high appreciation of the cooperation that I have received from this Committee.
14463,2003-04,"Without that, I simply could not have reached here."
14464,2003-04,Task Forces 1 3 7 .
14465,2003-04,"As the Hon’ble Members are aware, in September 2002, three Task Forces were set up: one each on Direct and Indirect Taxes, and the third on Corporate Governance."
14466,2003-04,These were chaired respectively by Dr. Vijay Kelkar and Shri Naresh Chandra.
14467,2003-04,"The former also issued preliminary proposals in November, in the form of consultative papers for public comment."
14468,2003-04,"After evaluating all these comments, final reports were given in December, 2002."
14469,2003-04,Public response to these Task Forces and their Reports has been overwhelming.
14470,2003-04,This is a tribute to the excellent work done by Dr. Kelkar and Shri Naresh Chandra and their selfless and dedicated teams.
14471,2003-04,"By opening up the budgetmaking process, the Kelkar Committee Reports have more than fulfilled my basic purpose of involving, as far as practical, our citizens, in the annual budgetary exercise."
14472,2003-04,"I have personally benefited very greatly from these Reports, as also from this open debate."
14473,2003-04,"I take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the two Chairmen and all members of the Task Forces, as also members of the public for their valuable comments and suggestions."
14474,2003-04,"With regard to the Naresh Chandra Committee Report, corporate governance is high on the Government’s agenda."
14475,2003-04,There will be a set of regulations that does not inhibit managerial initiative while instituting a mechanism for early detection of frauds and their prevention.
14476,2003-04,"For this purpose, a Serious Frauds Office has already been set up."
14477,2003-04,"Now, let me deal with the two reports on taxation."
14478,2003-04,The Ministry has analysed them fully.
14479,2003-04,The basic philosophy of these reports is sound.
14480,2003-04,"For a modern, forward looking and in the long run, revenuebeneficial taxation system the proposals that have been mooted may be the most appropriate."
14481,2003-04,"There is need to, eventually, move away from an exemption and discretion based system to a different, more current order."
14482,2003-04,"That is the ideal that the Task Forces, particularly in respect of direct taxes have suggested; a radically new approach to taxation."
14483,2003-04,"This ideal is difficult to achieve in one leap, and I can scarcely cross the existing conceptual chasm in two."
14484,2003-04,"We cannot ignore the commitments made, or wish them away."
14485,2003-04,That is why I choose to bridge the divide.
14486,2003-04,"We will, therefore, stay with the basics of the present system of taxation, but we will, indeed have already accepted, most of the suggestions made by the Task Forces designed to eliminate procedural complexities, reduce paper work, simplify tax administration and to 25 enhance efficiency, also integrate such tax proposals as the system can, at present, absorb, with one overriding thought: Mr. Speaker, Sir, this will be a move away from a suspicionridden, harassment generating, coercioninclined regime to a trustbased, ‘green channel’ system."
14487,2003-04,I do this entirely on the basis of my faith in my countrymen and women.
14488,2003-04,I now come to the tax proposals proper.
14489,2003-04,"What I describe below are the major changes proposed, not every detail of change, apart from those already described in the portion dealing with specific sectors."
14490,2003-04,"Details are contained in the Finance Bill and the relevant notifications, which will be laid on the Table of the House in due course."
14491,2003-04,"Moreover, as the Hon’ble Members are aware, Budget Day restrictions in respect of clearance of goods have been revoked to allow economic activity to continue without any hindrance."
14492,2003-04,Direct taxes Rates 1 4 6 .
14493,2003-04,"Rates of income tax, both corporate and noncorporate, have remained largely stable since 1997."
14494,2003-04,"As stability and continuity are commended as virtues in tax regimes, I intend to be virtuous."
14495,2003-04,"Corporate tax structure will, therefore, be left as it is; except that the 5 per cent surcharge, levied last year in connection with the security of India, will be halved in the case of corporate assessees, firms, foreign companies, cooperatives, and local authorities."
14496,2003-04,"In the case of individuals, Hindu Undivided Families HUF, and Association of Persons etc., this surcharge will be removed entirely, except in the case of those earning an income above Rs 8.5 lakhs."
14497,2003-04,"From them, that is those earning above Rs 8.5 lakh, I will collect a 10 per cent surcharge on the tax, which works out to less than 3 paise out of an income of a rupee."
14498,2003-04,"But, I have provided some relief to them, as well, for example, in standard deduction."
14499,2003-04,Standard deduction 1 4 7 .
14500,2003-04,There are more salaried taxpayers at income levels of Rs 2 lakh and above than the nonsalaried.
14501,2003-04,"I do often wonder, why?"
14502,2003-04,"That is why the salaried always complain, saying they do not have – that cliché phrase – a level playing field; I agree, they do suffer a more exacting regime."
14503,2003-04,"Therefore, as already announced, their standard deductions are raised."
14504,2003-04,"Individual taxpayers having income from dividends, interest, etc. are given a general deduction of Rs 9,000."
14505,2003-04,"As promised by me earlier, this deduction has now been increased to Rs 12,000."
14506,2003-04,"An additional deduction of Rs 3,000 is allowable in respect of interest from Government securities."
14507,2003-04,"Thus, the total deduction available under Section 80L will be Rs 15,000."
14508,2003-04,"Though dividend will not be taxable in the hands of the recipient from next year, I propose to retain this deduction at Rs 15,000 for next year also."
14509,2003-04,Tax deduction at source 1 4 9 .
14510,2003-04,A lot of unintended difficulties are caused by certain provisions dealing with tax deductible at source TDS; much too tedious to elaborate here.
14511,2003-04,I want to correct this.
14512,2003-04,"Therefore, in simple terms, it is now provided that individuals and HUF carrying on business or profession need not deduct tax at source, from payments made by them for personal purposes."
14513,2003-04,There is a category of taxpayers in India ordinarily not found elsewhere – the ‘not ordinarily resident’.
14514,2003-04,They do not normally have to pay tax on their foreign sourced income.
14515,2003-04,There has been confusion on this provision in the past due to differing legal interpretations.
14516,2003-04,"To set matters at rest, the relevant definition has been suitably amended so that the benefit will now be available to persons for two years in case they remain nonresidents for the last nine out of 10 years."
14517,2003-04,Administrative reform 1 5 1 .
14518,2003-04,"In the area of tax administration, Government has initiated a whole basket of reforms, mainly on the basis of the recommendations of the Kelkar Committee."
14519,2003-04,Some of a b c d e f g
14520,2003-04,"Hon’ble Members, if in only one attempt I could halve this headache, please reflect upon the immense possibilities that lie on this route; immediate introduction of a onepage only return form for individual tax payers, having income from salary, house property and interest, etc."
14521,2003-04,"This has already been devised, and will come into operation from April 1 onwards; the Income Tax Act is being amended to enable electronic filing of returns; abolition of taxclearance certificates currently needed by a person leaving India, or any person submitting a tender for a government contract."
14522,2003-04,"Henceforth, only expatriates who come to India in connection with business, profession or employment, would have to furnish a guarantee from their employer, etc. in respect of the tax payable before they leave India."
14523,2003-04,"An Indian citizen, before leaving India, will only have to give his/her permanent account number, and the period of his/her intended visit abroad to the emigration authorities; and simplifying the procedure and methods employed during search and seizure, and during survey by the Income Tax department."
14524,2003-04,"First, hereafter, stocks found during the course of a search and seizure operation will not be seized under any circumstances."
14525,2003-04,"Second, no confession shall be obtained during such search and seizure operations."
14526,2003-04,"Third, no survey operation will be 27 authorized by an officer below the rank of Joint Commissioner of Income Tax."
14527,2003-04,"Finally, books of account impounded during survey will not be retained beyond ten days, without the prior approval of the Chief Commissioner."
14528,2003-04,"These, Hon’ble Members, are only a few steps on this long road called simplification and rationalisation of taxation."
14529,2003-04,It is not for nothing that even Albert Einstein had ruefully observed that he found ‘Income Tax the most difficult thing upon Earth to understand’.
14530,2003-04,"Mr. Speaker, please sympathize with me."
14531,2003-04,I endeavour which Einstein found so difficult.
14532,2003-04,Indirect taxes: excise Rationalisation and relief to make easy that 1 5 4 .
14533,2003-04,Rationalisation of excise rate structure and reduction of the multiplicity of rates are integral to the total tax reform process.
14534,2003-04,"In this regard, I propose to prescribe a 3tier excise duty structure of 8 per cent, 16 per cent and 24 per cent."
14535,2003-04,"These rates would, however, not apply in the case of petroleum and tobacco products, pan masala, and items attracting specific duty rates."
14536,2003-04,"I have already announced a separate package for textiles, and some changes in the duty structure relevant for some other key sectors while dealing with those sectors."
14537,2003-04,I will now refer to the changes proposed in various other commodities.
14538,2003-04,"Currently, tyres, aerated soft drinks, polyester filament yarn, air conditioners and motor cars attract excise duty of 32 per cent."
14539,2003-04,I propose to reduce the duty on these items to 24 per cent.
14540,2003-04,"Certain exempt items were brought under the tax net during the last two years with an optional duty of 4 per cent without CENVAT, or 16 per cent with CENVAT."
14541,2003-04,I propose to eliminate the 4 per cent duty without CENVAT.
14542,2003-04,"However, keeping in view the number of representations received for exemptions, I propose to fully exempt the following items of the ordinary citizen’s use, currently attracting 4 per cent excise duty:"
14543,2003-04,Rest of the items attracting 4 per cent without CENVAT will now attract duty at 8 per cent with CENVAT.
14544,2003-04,I also propose to fully exempt from excise duty matches made by the non mechanized sector.
14545,2003-04,"However, matches made by semimechanized and mechanized sector will attract an advalorem duty of 8 per cent without CENVAT."
14546,2003-04,"I also propose to reduce the excise duty chargeable under the Medicinal and Toilet Preparations Act, on medicines and toilet preparations containing alcohol, from the present high rates of 20 to 50 per cent to a uniform rate of 16 per cent, at par with the rates on similar items not containing alcohol."
14547,2003-04,"However, exemptions on ayurvedic and unani medicines, containing selfgenerated alcohol, will continue."
14548,2003-04,"I propose to reduce the excise duty on items like pressure cookers, ophthalmic blanks, biscuits, boiled sweets and dental chairs from 16 per cent to 8 per cent."
14549,2003-04,Recorded audio compact discs CDs will be fully exempt from excise duty.
14550,2003-04,"It is my conviction, Mr. Speaker, that these measures will result in “Grihini ki tukia mein anna”: the second part of my assurance."
14551,2003-04,"As I have earlier stated, efficient transportation is critical for rapid development."
14552,2003-04,I have already announced major reduction in excise duty on motor cars and tyres.
14553,2003-04,"Further, on environmental considerations, I propose to reduce the duty on electric vehicles from 16 per cent to 8 per cent."
14554,2003-04,"Presently, there is an inequitous duty structure between buses and trucks, manufactured by an integrated unit, visàvis independent body builders, who are exempt from excise duty."
14555,2003-04,"To reduce the duty differential and to promote body building by integrated bus and truck manufacturers, as a measure of road safety, I propose to increase the duty on chassis from 16 per cent, to 16 per cent plus Rs 10,000 per chassis, cleared for outside body building."
14556,2003-04,"The body building activity in the unorganized sector would, however, continue to remain exempt."
14557,2003-04,"It is an accepted principle that while taxation should be moderate, the tax base has to be large, so that every sector contributes moderately to the national economy."
14558,2003-04,"Following this principle, I propose to impose fresh excise levy of 8 per cent on the following items, with the CENVAT credit facility available to them: branded refined edible oil and vanaspati packed in sealed containers for retail sale – this will not apply to unbranded oil; lay flat tubing; chemical reagents; woodfree particle or fibre board made from agro base; paper and paper board made from non conventional raw material; and populated printed circuit board for black and white TV sets."
14559,2003-04,"Considering that specific rates on cement and clinker have remained unchanged for a considerably long period of time, I propose to now increase these 29 rates by Rs 50 per tonne."
14560,2003-04,This will mean a modest increase of Rs 2.50 per 50 kg. bag of cement.
14561,2003-04,I also propose to impose additional excise duty of Rs 1.50 per litre on light diesel oil to further discourage its use as an adulterant.
14562,2003-04,"For trade facilitation, I propose to take the following measures, a The present system of fortnightly payment of excise duty will be liberalized to permit payment of duty at the end of the month."
14563,2003-04,"Further, the excise duty will be considered to have been paid on the date the cheque is presented to the bank subject to realisation."
14564,2003-04,This facility will now be extended to cases where freight is worked out on an equalized basis also.
14565,2003-04,"Over the years, the Maximum Retail Price MRP based excise levy has proved to be an effective measure of simplification by reducing valuation disputes."
14566,2003-04,I propose to extend the MRPbased excise levy to chewing tobacco and insecticides.
14567,2003-04,National Calamity Contingency Fund 1 6 8 .
14568,2003-04,"Unfortunately, the Nation has been facing a severe drought this year."
14569,2003-04,The funds raised earlier under the National Calamity Contingent Duty are not sufficient.
14570,2003-04,"It is, therefore, proposed to impose a 1 per cent National Calamity Contingent Duty on polyester filament yarn, motor cars, multi utility vehicles and twowheelers."
14571,2003-04,"Similarly, crude, domestic or imported, will also be subjected to a duty of Rs 50 per metric tonne for this purpose."
14572,2003-04,"However, these new levies will be limited to one year only."
14573,2003-04,"While the Small Scale Exemption Scheme aims at providing a distinctive advantage to labourintensive units, there are reports of misuse of this facility in certain sectors."
14574,2003-04,I propose to withdraw this facility in case of a few items and rationalize the eligibility limit of Rs 3 crore under the general SSI scheme.
14575,2003-04,"I propose to enhance the general service tax rate from 5 per cent to 8 per cent, and also impose service tax on 10 new services."
14576,2003-04,"While the increase in the tax rates will come into effect on enactment of the Finance Bill, the levy of tax on the new services will take effect from a date to be notified."
14577,2003-04,"Last year credit of service tax on input services were extended for payment of service tax, provided the input and the final services fell within the same category."
14578,2003-04,I propose to extend this facility across all services.
14579,2003-04,"Thus, the credit will now be available even if the input and the final services fall under different categories."
14580,2003-04,Indirect taxes: customs External liberalisation 1 7 2 .
14581,2003-04,Rate rationalisation and reduction of peak rates of customs duties has been an integral part of economic reform in the country.
14582,2003-04,"The economy has not only 30 ‘weathered’ the removal of quantitative restrictions on imports and the reduction in customs duty rates, but has responded by improving its competitiveness and demonstrating the inherent strength of its external balance of payments."
14583,2003-04,"As a part of this continuous process, and in line with the pronouncements made by several of my predecessors, I now propose to reduce the peak rate of customs duty from 30 per cent to 25 per cent, excluding agriculture and dairy products."
14584,2003-04,Rationalisation and relief 1 7 3 .
14585,2003-04,It has been our policy to minimize sectorspecific and enduse based customs duty exemptions.
14586,2003-04,"Metallurgical coke and nickel attract customs duty rates at 15 per cent and 5 per cent, depending upon their usage."
14587,2003-04,"I, therefore, propose to rationalize the customs duty on these two items to a uniform rate of 10 per cent."
14588,2003-04,Conch shells and seed lac are really handicraft items.
14589,2003-04,Their duty will come down from 30 per cent – why was it ever 30 per cent – to 5 per cent.
14590,2003-04,"Import duty on oleo pine resin, a raw material for rosin shall be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
14591,2003-04,"Value limit for a full customs duty exemption, for bona fide commercial samples and gifts, however, shall be raised from Rs 5,000 to Rs 10,000."
14592,2003-04,I also propose to reduce the customs duty on passenger baggage from 60 per cent to 50 per cent.
14593,2003-04,"Phosphoric acid, an input for fertilizers, is exempt from the Special Additional Duty of Customs SAD."
14594,2003-04,"For the sake of uniformity, I propose to exempt rock phosphate and crude sulphur, inputs for phosphoric acid, also from SAD."
14595,2003-04,The basic customs duty on alcoholic liquor will come down to 166 per cent in conformity with our WTO commitments.
14596,2003-04,I also propose to rationalize the countervailing duty in respect of imported alcoholic beverages including wines.
14597,2003-04,Capital goods and infrastructure 1 8 0 .
14598,2003-04,"Considering higher usage levels of Liquified Natural Gas LNG, I propose to reduce the customs duty on LNG regassification plants from 25 per cent to 5 per cent."
14599,2003-04,There is need to support cleaner and environmentfriendly technologies.
14600,2003-04,"With this end in view, I propose to reduce the customs duty on components of membrane cell technology used in the caustic soda industry from 15 per cent to 5 per cent."
14601,2003-04,Safety and modernisation are key issues before Indian Railways.
14602,2003-04,"I propose, therefore, to reduce customs duty on spares for diesel locomotives, parts for conversion of locomotives from DC to AC from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, and loco simulators for training of drivers from 25 per cent to 5 per cent."
14603,2003-04,"Given the importance of promoting foodprocessing and transporting agricultural products, I propose to reduce the customs duty on refrigerated trucks from 25 per cent to 20 per cent."
14604,2003-04,"I assure Hon’ble Members of faster clearance hereafter of cargo and fewer procedures, by reducing the transaction cost, thus facilitating exports and imports."
14605,2003-04,"For this, a number of measures have been taken to simplify and modernize the customs clearance procedures, with the main emphasis being on cutting down contact of trade with the officers, to the extent possible, and introducing computerisation in customs clearances."
14606,2003-04,"While these efforts will continue, as a further trade facilitation measure, I propose to increase the interestfree period for warehoused goods from 30 to 90 days and to reduce the rate of interest for the period beyond 90 days to reflect the market rate of interest."
14607,2003-04,"To bring our customs clearance procedures at par with best international practices, I propose to introduce, this year itself, a selfassessment scheme for importers and exporters."
14608,2003-04,"Briefly stated, under the selfassessment scheme, the importer himself/herself will determine the classification of goods, including claim for any exemption benefit, and the system will calculate the duty based on his/her declaration."
14609,2003-04,Physical inspection of imported goods will be done by using risk assessment and management techniques on a computerbased system and not on the orders of customs examining staff.
14610,2003-04,"Further, the existing system of concurrent audit of import documents will be replaced by postclearance audit, as prevalent in developed countries."
14611,2003-04,"Sir, my proposals made in this budget on the Direct Taxes will result in a revenue loss of Rs 2,955 crore while the proposals relating to indirect taxes will result in a gain of Rs 3294 crore."
14612,2003-04,Revised Estimates for 20022003 1 8 7 .
14613,2003-04,"The revised estimates for the current fiscal year show a decrease in expenditure of Rs 6,296 crore as compared to the Budget estimates."
14614,2003-04,"This reduction in overall expenditure has been achieved despite additional expenditure on drought relief, food subsidy, and the Delhi Metro Rail Project."
14615,2003-04,"Net tax revenues for the Centre are estimated to be Rs 164,177 crore compared to the Budget estimate of Rs 172,965 crore, thereby reflecting a shortfall of Rs 8,788 crore."
14616,2003-04,"Non tax revenue is estimated at Rs 72,759 crore, Rs 619 crore more than the estimated level of Rs 72,140 crore."
14617,2003-04,"However, disinvestment receipts, at Rs 3,360 crore are lower than the Budget estimate of Rs 12,000 crore."

14619,2003-04,"In the budget estimates for 20032004, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 438,795 crore, of which Rs 120,974 crore is for Plan and Rs 317,821 crore for nonPlan."

14623,2003-04,"Out of this, an amount of Rs 72,152 crore is being provided as Budget support for Central Plan."

14629,2003-04,"Government is fully committed to modernizing the armed forces, and equipping them with the best available."
14630,2003-04,"Therefore, during the next year, any additional requirement that may emerge on account of modernisation needs of the three defence services, or on account of the Married Accommodation Project, will be fully met."
14631,2003-04,There will be no shortage of funds for defence.

14634,2003-04,XI. CONCLUSION 1 9 3 .
14635,2003-04,"Sir, in formulating the Budget for 200304, the Government has had to carefully and delicately balance the need for accelerating growth, while simultaneously making progress on the front of fiscal consolidation."
14636,2003-04,I know that what Government has done is the most judicious under the circumstances.
14637,2003-04,"This budget is about addressing the problem of poverty and lifetime concerns of our citizens; of giving a major boost to infrastructure; and laying the foundations for balanced, accelerated growth of agriculture and industry, plus tax reform."
14638,2003-04,"I have tried to address the ‘Panch Priorities’, and I hope, that after this year of drought, our economy will respond favourably to the Budget package and demonstrate impressive growth in 200304."
14639,2003-04,"Let me end, Mr. Speaker, by reiterating that this Budget is of an “India that is on the move.”"
14640,2003-04,"An India, that now rapidly advances to prosperity."
14641,2003-04,"It is about an India that banishes poverty, and builds on its great resource base, the strength of its human capital and the immense reservoir of its knowledge."
14642,2003-04,"Sir, I commend the Budget to the House."
14643,2004-05,NATIONAL COMMON MINIMUM PROGRAMME: THE GUIDING LIGHT 3 .
14644,2004-05,"The United Progressive Alliance UPA has given to itself, and to the people of this country, a Common Minimum Programme."
14645,2004-05,The Government has since adopted it as the National Common Minimum Programme NCMP.
14646,2004-05,The programme spells out seven clear economic objectives: 1 maintaining a growth rate of 7  8 per cent per year for a sustained period;
14647,2004-05,"Every five years, or sometimes sooner, the people of India speak in their collective voice."
14648,2004-05,The message is usually unambiguous and clear.
14649,2004-05,Elections 2004 were no different.
14650,2004-05,The people’s vote against one coalition – and the vote in favour of another coalition – was a vote for change.
14651,2004-05,"As the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, said in his address to the Nation two weeks ago, the people have sought “a change in the manner in which this country is run, a change in national priorities, and a change in the processes and focus of governance.”"
14652,2004-05,I shall make every effort to be true to that mandate.
14653,2004-05,The UPA government began its journey in May this year.
14654,2004-05,"However, I may note thatthe President gives his assent to the Finance Bill, nearly onehalf of the year will be over."
14655,2004-05,There is also an Interim Budget left behind by my predecessor.
14656,2004-05,"The Government has to shift gears; and even if we are able to do so quickly, it would leave us only about six months to achieve our objectives for this year."
14657,2004-05,We have therefore decided to adopt an innovative approach.
14658,2004-05,The Planning Commission has advised the ministries and departments to redefine their priorities and redraw their programmes in accordance with the NCMP.
14659,2004-05,This will necessarily involve some changes in the allocations under each head of expenditure.
14660,2004-05,"Besides, new programmes or schemes may have to be launched, and old ones restructured."
14661,2004-05,"Under the circumstances, it was considered optimal to allow the ongoing programmes to continue until the Planning Commission completes an exhaustive review and reorients the expenditure pattern to conform to the NCMP objectives."
14662,2004-05,"One thing, however, is clear."
14663,2004-05,The Plan resources made available in the Interim Budget will be insufficient.
14664,2004-05,"Hence, in addition to the Gross Budgetary Support GBS of Rs 135,071 crore provided in the Interim Budget, I propose to provide a sum of Rs 10,000 crore."
14665,2004-05,"This, and some other additional allocations, will raise total plan expenditure to Rs 145,590 crore in the Budget Estimates for 200405."
14666,2004-05,The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act FRBM 2003 has streamlined the Budget presentation process.
14667,2004-05,"The Government has demonstrated its commitment to prudent fiscal and financial policies by notifying the Act and the Rules with effect from July 5, 2004."
14668,2004-05,"Along with the Budget, a mediumterm fiscal policy statement, a fiscal policy strategy statement and a macroeconomic framework statement are being presented to the House."
14669,2004-05,"Under the FRBM Act, I am obliged to wipe out the revenue deficit by 200708."
14670,2004-05,"However, the NCMP has proposed that we do so by 200809."
14671,2004-05,"In my view, 200809 is a more credible terminal year; it will also coincide with the term of this Government."
14672,2004-05,"Hence, I propose to move an amendment to this effect through the Finance Bill."
14673,2004-05,I am committed to implementing the FRBM Act.
14674,2004-05,The elimination of revenue deficit will open up fiscal space up to 3 per cent of GDP for enhanced public investment without undermining fiscal prudence.
14675,2004-05,The economic fundamentals appear strong and the balance of payments is robust.
14676,2004-05,"Although there are short term pressures on prices, the outlook for the year is benign and the Government is fully alert."
14677,2004-05,"Growth will be sustained by increased production and value addition in agriculture, a marked improvement in industrial production, and continued buoyancy in the performance of the services sector."
14678,2004-05,The Government will follow a 5year road map to achieve the NCMP objective of bringing about rapid growth with stability and equity.
14679,2004-05,"Sequencing the measures 3 in an appropriate fashion and continuing the reform process, which ushered in the era of rapid growth, are the main challenges."
14680,2004-05,"The Government is committed to strike a fine balance among the three mutually reinforcing objectives of growth, stability and equity."
14681,2004-05,ASSAULT ON POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT 10.
14682,2004-05,"One of our greatest assets is our human resources, our people."
14683,2004-05,"Empowering the people, especially the poor, with universal access to education and health, and facilitating their full participation in the growth process through gainful employment, will enhance their welfare."
14684,2004-05,It will also reinforce the growth process itself.
14685,2004-05,This win win strategy is the keystone of the economic policy framework of the Government.
14686,2004-05,"I have the benefit of the wise counsel of the Prime Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh."
14687,2004-05,"In our scheme of things, the poor will have a first charge not only on the additional sum of Rs 10,000 crore of GBS that I propose to provide today, but also on the entire Plan funds that the Planning Commission will reallocate."
14688,2004-05,"The poor want basic education for their children: we shall provide it, and we shall make sure that the child remains in school for at least eight years."
14689,2004-05,We shall also make sure that the child is not hungry while she or he is at school.
14690,2004-05,The poor want drinking water: we shall ensure that every habitation has an assured source of drinking water.
14691,2004-05,"The poor want basic health care, medicines at fair prices and a doctor within a reasonable distance: we shall ensure that the public health system has adequate human and financial resources to provide basic medical care."
14692,2004-05,"The poor want jobs for their children: we shall ensure that through higher investments, and through targeted intervention, jobs are available to them."
14693,2004-05,"While the Planning Commission will make the final allocations, I may assure the House that crucial programmes such as Food for Work, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, Midday CookedMeal Scheme, basic health care, railway moderanisation and safety, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, drinking water, investment in agriculture, Provision of Rural amenities in Urban Areas PURA, roads, and science and technology, including biotechnology, will receive priority and will be provided with additional funds."
14694,2004-05,"I propose to continue, and expand, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana."
14695,2004-05,"At present, 1.5 crore families are covered."
14696,2004-05,These families are provided with 35 kg. of foodgrains per family per month at a highly subsidized price of Rs  2 per kg.
14697,2004-05,"In the current year, I propose to cover 2 crore families."
14698,2004-05,I expect that the offtake of rice and wheat will increase.
14699,2004-05,"Consequently, the Antyodaya Anna Yojana will receive a subsidy of nearly Rs 3500 crore."
14700,2004-05,"A provision for this level of expenditure has been included in the allocation for food subsidy of Rs 25,800 crore."
14701,2004-05,Fair price shops constitute the backbone of the food security system for the poor.
14702,2004-05,We shall address the weaknesses in the system and strengthen public distribution.
14703,2004-05,I shall return to this subject a little later.
14704,2004-05,Investment and growth will create new job opportunities for our young men and women.
14705,2004-05,"Nevertheless, currently there is a need to ensure that unemployment does not take a heavy toll on the poor people."
14706,2004-05,Work has begun on the National Employment Guarantee Act.
14707,2004-05,The object is to guarantee 100 days of employment in a year to one ablebodied person in every poor household.
14708,2004-05,The Bill will take into account the experience gained in Maharashtra.
14709,2004-05,Government will also take care to avoid the pitfalls pointed out by responsible critics.
14710,2004-05,"My colleague, the Minister of Labour, expects that he would be able to introduce the Bill in Parliament shortly."
14711,2004-05,"Pending the enactment of the new law, I propose to launch a new Food for Work programme in 150 districts classified as most backward and identified as areas in immediate need of such a programme."
14712,2004-05,Allocations under different schemes will be pulled together to support the Food for Work programme.
14713,2004-05,"There are substantial funds totaling over Rs 6000 crore under SGRY, SGSY, SJSRY, REGP and PMRY."
14714,2004-05,"Depending on the demand for such work, more funds will be allocated in the current year."
14715,2004-05,I expect to increase the allocations substantially over the next four years.
14716,2004-05,Special care will be taken in laying down the guidelines for the programme so that the money and labour expended result in durable and visible assets benefiting the whole community.
14717,2004-05,Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes 17.
14718,2004-05,The welfare of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes is close to my heart.
14719,2004-05,The allocation for programmes concerning the Scheduled Castes is Rs 1180 crore an increase from Rs 1137 crore and for Scheduled Tribes is Rs 1146 crore an increase from Rs 1087 crore.
14720,2004-05,"Other plan schemes such as SGSY, SGRY and IAY also contain specific reservations for beneficiaries belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes."
14721,2004-05,The reservations range from 50 per cent to 60 per cent.
14722,2004-05,"Particular attention will be paid to the welfare, especially education, of the minorities."
14723,2004-05,"Hence, an additional allocation of Rs 50 crore has been made for the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation."
14724,2004-05,Microfinance initiatives are a costeffective way to take the banking system to the poor.
14725,2004-05,"The SelfHelp Group SHG – bank linkage programme, initiated in 1992, has come a long way."
14726,2004-05,"Until March 31, 2004, 1.67 crore families had benefited through 10.79 lakh SHGs financed by banks."
14727,2004-05,"While the SHG concept will be promoted vigorously, I am of the view that matured SHGs may be in a position to graduate from consumption or production credit to starting microenterprises."
14728,2004-05,"An indicative target of credit linking 5.85 lakh SHGs during the period up to March 31, 2007 has been set for NABARD, SIDBI, banks and other agencies."
14729,2004-05,"Before I deal with other areas of concern on which the Budget will have an impact, let me give you a snapshot of the goals that I have set for myself :"
14730,2004-05,"I believe that the key to growth is investment – public and private, domestic and foreign."
14731,2004-05,It is therefore my intention to considerably enhance investment in all sectors of the economy.
14732,2004-05,"However, fiscal prudence and financial discipline will remain the overarching objective."
14733,2004-05,I shall also take into account the availability of resources and the absorptive capacity of various sectors.
14734,2004-05,EDUCATION AND HEALTH Education 22.
14735,2004-05,"In my scheme of things, no issue enjoys a higher priority than providing basic education to all children."
14736,2004-05,The NCMP mandates Government to levy an education cess.
14737,2004-05,I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent.
14738,2004-05,The new cess will yield about Rs 4000  5000 crore in a full year.
14739,2004-05,"The whole of the amount collected as cess will be earmarked for education, which will naturally include providing a nutritious cooked midday meal."
14740,2004-05,"If primary education and the nutritious cooked meal scheme can work hand in hand, I believe there will be a new dawn for the poor children of India."
14741,2004-05,I am concerned about the quality of technical education in the country.
14742,2004-05,"Lest I be misunderstood, I am not referring to the IITs but to the ITIs."
14743,2004-05,ITIs are the training ground for skilled manpower.
14744,2004-05,The skills imparted by ITIs must keep pace with the technological demands of industry and the expanding universe of knowledge.
14745,2004-05,There is only one benchmark for our technicians – and that is the world standard.
14746,2004-05,"In order to produce technicians of world standard, Government proposes to launch a programme in the Central sector to upgrade 500 ITIs over the next 5 years at the rate of 100 ITIs a year."
14747,2004-05,"Appropriate infrastructure and equipment will be provided, the syllabi will be upgraded and new trades will be introduced."
14748,2004-05,This is an area where I welcome Chambers of Commerce and Industry to join hands with the Government and create a publicprivate partnership model for designing and implementing the scheme.
14749,2004-05,The selection of the ITIs will be done in consultation with the State Governments.
14750,2004-05,"An education loan scheme has been in operation since April 2001 under which loans up to Rs 7.50 lakh and Rs 15 lakh are available for professional courses within the country and abroad, respectively."
14751,2004-05,The requirement of collateral was dispensed with for loans up to Rs 4 lakh.
14752,2004-05,"I am happy to say that commercial banks have now agreed to waive the need for collateral for loans up to Rs 7.5 lakh, if a satisfactory guarantee is provided on behalf of the student."
14753,2004-05,"Thus, no student admitted to any professional course, including courses in IITs, IIMs and medical colleges, will be deprived of the opportunity to study because of lack of funds."
14754,2004-05,Access to medical care is not easily available to the poor.
14755,2004-05,The Universal Health Insurance Scheme UHIS now in operation is skewed in favour of the nonpoor.
14756,2004-05,"As a result, only a very small number of families below the poverty line BPL – actually 11,408 till May, 2004 – have been covered."
14757,2004-05,"Although the premiums are low, BPL families seem to avoid the scheme due to their inability to pay the premium."
14758,2004-05,"In its present design, the scheme may not be sustainable."
14759,2004-05,"I, therefore, propose to redesign the scheme and make it exclusive for persons and families below the poverty line."
14760,2004-05,"The revised premium would be Rs 165 for individuals, Rs 248 for a family of five and Rs 330 for a family of seven, without any reduction in benefits."
14761,2004-05,"To offset the reduction in premium, I propose to enhance the premium subsidy from Rs 100 at present to Rs 200 for an individual, Rs 300 for a family of five and Rs 400 for a family of seven."
14762,2004-05,The cost to the exchequer will be Rs 40 crore in a full year.
14763,2004-05,"If the money is fully spent, the number insured will rise to about 10 lakh."
14764,2004-05,"In addition to the above, I propose to introduce a new Group Health Insurance Scheme through public sector nonlife insurance companies."
14765,2004-05,The insured will be members of SelfHelp Groups SHGs and other credit linked groups CLGs who avail of loans from banks or cooperative institutions.
14766,2004-05,"Under the group health insurance scheme, the premium will be Rs 120 per person, but the insurance cover would be for a sum of Rs 10,000."
14767,2004-05,The NCMP also rightly emphasizes the need for an accelerated AIDS control programme.
14768,2004-05,Bold and determined efforts need to be made to achieve zerolevel growth of HIV/AIDS.
14769,2004-05,"These will include improved surveillance through the setting up of more sentinel sites and use of primary health centres to monitor HIV/AIDS, public awareness campaigns, promotion of safe sex through the use of condoms, prevention of drug abuse and distribution of disposable syringes."
14770,2004-05,The allocation for prevention and control of HIV/AIDS is Rs  259 crore.
14771,2004-05,AGRICULTURE AND THE RURAL ECONOMY 28.
14772,2004-05,Boosting agricultural growth through diversification and development of agro processing is one of the objectives of the NCMP.
14773,2004-05,"The Prime Minister, in his address to the Nation on June 24, 2004 promised a “New Deal” for rural India."
14774,2004-05,"This New Deal is not only essential for rural development and welfare, but also essential for achieving sustained overall annual growth of 78 per cent and generating employment."
14775,2004-05,The agriculture sector requires massive investments.
14776,2004-05,Such investments have to be through creditenabled private investment and enhanced public investment.
14777,2004-05,I also intend to use fiscal instruments to boost investment in agriculture.
14778,2004-05,It is my intention to double the flow of agricultural credit in three years.
14779,2004-05,"We have made a beginning by announcing a comprehensive policy on agricultural credit on June 18, 2004."
14780,2004-05,"The policy has been received well and will be finetuned, if necessary."
14781,2004-05,"Government has entrusted the implementation of the policy to the public sector and private sector banks, the regional rural banks RRBs and the cooperative banks."
14782,2004-05,Each RRB has a sponsor bank.
14783,2004-05,I propose to hold each sponsor bank squarely accountable for the performance of RRBs under its control.
14784,2004-05,RRBs that adopt a new governance standard and that abide by the prudential regulations will qualify for receiving funds from the Government for their restructuring.
14785,2004-05,The third arm for delivering farm credit is the cooperative banking system.
14786,2004-05,"Unless cooperative banks are healthy and creditworthy, it would not be possible to reach credit to every farmer in need of credit."
14787,2004-05,"In order to find a durable solution, I propose to appoint a Task Force to examine the reforms required in the cooperative banking system including the appropriate regulatory regime."
14788,2004-05,"The Task Force will be requested to act with all deliberate speed and submit its report by October 31, 2004."
14789,2004-05,"Irrigation, Rural Infrastructure 34."
14790,2004-05,The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme AIBP was introduced in 1996 97 and was allotted large funds year after year.
14791,2004-05,"Yet, out of 178 large and medium irrigation projects that were identified, only 28 have been completed."
14792,2004-05,The programme is being restructured.
14793,2004-05,"Truly last mile projects that can be completed by March 2005 will be given overriding priority, and other projects that can be completed by March 2006 will also be taken up in the current year."
14794,2004-05,"Next year we shall move the goalpost to March 2007, the year after to March 2008, and so on."
14795,2004-05,I have provided a sum of Rs 2800 crore to the AIBP this year.
14796,2004-05,The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF was established in NABARD in 199495.
14797,2004-05,"Five months ago, a decision was taken to close the RIDF and establish, in its place, another Fund with slightly different objectives."
14798,2004-05,Many State Governments and many honourable Members have opposed the closure of RIDF.
14799,2004-05,"In deference to their wishes, and in tune with my own thinking, I have decided to revive the RIDF."
14800,2004-05,"RIDF’s guidelines have been revised, and a corpus of Rs 8000 crore will be provided for RIDF during 200405."
14801,2004-05,I now turn to one of my big dreams.
14802,2004-05,Water is the lifeline of civilization.
14803,2004-05,We have been warned that the biggest crisis that the world will face in the 21st century will be the crisis of water.
14804,2004-05,"Water is indeed a renewable resource but, in any given year, it is not inexhaustible."
14805,2004-05,The crisis of water has affected the lives of millions of our fellow citizens.
14806,2004-05,"In some cities, whole households keep awake to receive one or two buckets of water well past midnight."
14807,2004-05,"In rural areas, the girl child is often pulled out of school in order to fetch water."
14808,2004-05,I am deeply concerned about the impending crisis.
14809,2004-05,I therefore propose an ambitious scheme.
14810,2004-05,"Through the ages, Indian agriculture has been sustained by natural and manmade water bodies such as lakes, tanks, ponds and 8 similar structures."
14811,2004-05,"It has been estimated that there are more than a million such structures and about 500,000 are used for irrigation."
14812,2004-05,Many of them have fallen into disuse.
14813,2004-05,Many of them have accumulated silt.
14814,2004-05,"I therefore propose to launch a massive scheme to repair, renovate and restore all the water bodies that are directly linked to agriculture."
14815,2004-05,"In the current year, we shall begin with pilot projects in at least five districts, and we shall select at least one district in each of the five regions of the country."
14816,2004-05,The estimated cost is Rs 100 crore.
14817,2004-05,"Funds for the five pilot projects will be drawn from existing programmes such as SGRY, PMGJSY, DPAP, DDP and IWDP."
14818,2004-05,"Once the pilot projects are completed and validated, Government will launch the National Water Resources Development Project and complete it over a period of 7 to 10 years."
14819,2004-05,Funds will not be a constraint for implementing the Project.
14820,2004-05,"For instance, Life Insurance Corporation of India invests, on an average, Rs 3000 crore per year in waterrelated programmes."
14821,2004-05,I also intend to pose this Project to multilateral agencies for funding.
14822,2004-05,It is my hope that by the beginning of the next decade all water bodies in India will be restored to their original glory and that the storage capacity of these water bodies will be augmented by at least 100 per cent.
14823,2004-05,"Water harvesting schemes, specific to an area or village, have been found to be extremely useful."
14824,2004-05,Such schemes are supported by a number of credit institutions.
14825,2004-05,"However, farmers belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes rarely benefit from such schemes."
14826,2004-05,"In order to help these farmers, Government will launch a nationwide water harvesting scheme."
14827,2004-05,"The scheme will cover one lakh irrigation units at an average cost of Rs 20,000 per unit."
14828,2004-05,NABARD will lend the money on easy terms and no margin money will be charged from the borrower.
14829,2004-05,"Government will provide a 50 per cent capital subsidy through NABARD, and the estimate for the scheme is Rs 100 crore."
14830,2004-05,Thousands of lives and thousands of head of cattle are lost every year due to floods.
14831,2004-05,"Floods are perennial in States like Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh."
14832,2004-05,The NCMP envisages full Central support to flood control works in inter State rivers and international rivers.
14833,2004-05,The Brahmaputra Board has prepared a plan for antierosion and flood control works in the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys.
14834,2004-05,A programme of flood control and antierosion will be launched in the current year.
14835,2004-05,"A similar programme is being implemented in the Gangabasin States of Uttaranchal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal."
14836,2004-05,Rs 30 crore has been allotted in the current year and additional funds will be provided to keep pace with the progress of works.
14837,2004-05,India is selfsufficient in wheat and paddy but deficient in other agricultural produce.
14838,2004-05,"The time has come to encourage our farmers to diversify into areas such as horticulture, floriculture and oilseeds."
14839,2004-05,The Anand model has been a great success in milk and milk products.
14840,2004-05,Government proposes to launch a National Horticulture Mission.
14841,2004-05,The goal is to double horticulture production from the current level of 150 million tonnes to 300 million tonnes by 201112.
14842,2004-05,I invite States to join hands with 9 the Government in launching this mission.
14843,2004-05,One of the steps that States will be encouraged to take is to emulate the Anand model and establish a State Level Cooperative Society for promoting horticulture.
14844,2004-05,Oilseeds is another critical area.
14845,2004-05,"Last year, we produced 25 million tonnes of oilseeds, but we also imported US$ 2.5 billion of edible oil."
14846,2004-05,Government will facilitate farmers to diversify into oilseeds by promoting superior seedtechnology and through an appropriate policy of price support.
14847,2004-05,"India must become a single market for all products, particularly agricultural produce."

14850,2004-05,"So far, ten States have initiated legal or administrative action for ‘direct marketing’ and ‘contract farming’ arrangements in line with the model law."
14851,2004-05,I urge all States to enact the model law at an early date.
14852,2004-05,Research and Development 4 4 .
14853,2004-05,Agricultural research and development is an area which deserves special attention.

14856,2004-05,"Agricultural research must be expanded rapidly to new frontiers such as bio technology, vaccines and diagnostics."

14859,2004-05,The Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium SFAC was set up in 1994.
14860,2004-05,"Although SFAC started functioning from 1998, its corpus stands at a meagre Rs 10.95 crore."
14861,2004-05,"In my view, SFAC should provide venture capital to projects and must be run, preferably by a banker, on purely business lines."
14862,2004-05,The MS Swaminathan Research Foundation has identified 13 districts where there is a huge potential for agri businesses and an appetite for investment of nearly Rs 170 crore.
14863,2004-05,"The Ministry of Agriculture has initiated action to improve the governance of SFAC, including the appointment of a banker as the chief executive."
14864,2004-05,"For my part, I propose to provide the necessary additional capital that SFAC will require to aggressively promote agribusinesses."

14868,2004-05,We shall continue with the scheme and make another evaluation.
14869,2004-05,"Meanwhile, a pilot scheme insuring farm income as opposed to crop has been launched in 19 districts across 12 States during Rabi 200304."
14870,2004-05,Government has decided to extend the scheme to Kharif 2004 in order to assess its feasibility.
14871,2004-05,"I wish to add that a weather insurance scheme appears to be more promising, at least in the design."
14872,2004-05,AIC is introducing the scheme on a trial basis in 20 rain gauge stations in the current crop season.
14873,2004-05,It is 10 difficult to tell at this stage which of the three schemes will be successful.
14874,2004-05,Agricultural insurance as well as livestock insurance are complex products and have to be designed with care.
14875,2004-05,I wish to reaffirm Government’s commitment to provide insurance cover to farming and livestock.
14876,2004-05,Sustainable growth depends upon the availability of efficient infrastructure.

14884,2004-05,"Initially, airports, seaports and tourism will be the target sectors of the IIG."
14885,2004-05,The Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission was intended to be implemented in the mission mode.

14887,2004-05,"More than 75,000 habitations are yet to be provided adequate drinking water."

14906,2004-05,Government attaches high priority to the development and expansion of port infrastructure.
14907,2004-05,"Presently, because of inadequate draft and cargo handling infrastructure, and partly due to locational disadvantages, mainline vessels often skip Indian ports."
14908,2004-05,"Containers from India are carried to their final destination after transshipment at Colombo, Dubai and other neighbouring ports."
14909,2004-05,Kochi has locational advantages compared to other major Indian ports since it is closer to the main sea routes.
14910,2004-05,"Government will facilitate the construction of an International Container Transshipment Terminal ICTT at Vallarpadam in Kochi port on Build, Operate and Transfer BOT basis."
14911,2004-05,Indira Awas Yojana IAY has been the main instrument to provide housing to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as to the nonSC/ST rural poor.

14913,2004-05,"A subsidy upto Rs 10,000 and loan upto Rs 40,000 are provided to eligible households."

14915,2004-05,"In the current year, I propose to raise the allocation to Rs 2247 crore and, if more money is needed, it will be found within the enhanced Plan outlay."
14916,2004-05,"In order to complement IAY, the Golden Jubilee Rural Housing Finance Scheme was launched in August 1997 to give a boost to rural housing."
14917,2004-05,"The response has been encouraging, and 10.26 lakh dwelling units have been financed so far."
14918,2004-05,"However, the number appears to have stagnated at about 180,000 per year in the last three years."
14919,2004-05,The scheme deserves a further stimulus.
14920,2004-05,I am happy to announce that the National Housing Bank has offered to reduce the rate of refinance by 25 basis points this year.
14921,2004-05,"RBI has agreed to revise the norms of repayment for rural housing loans by banks, so that the instalments coincide with crop cycles."
14922,2004-05,A major impediment to credit for rural housing is absence of proper title to the land.
14923,2004-05,The Government of West Bengal has made a law to simplify the creation of security.
14924,2004-05,It appears to me that the law deserves to be emulated by other States.
14925,2004-05,"With these changes, I believe it is possible to set a higher target of 250,000 rural housing units per year."
14926,2004-05,It is my goal to make the environment in India attractive for investors.
14927,2004-05,"In order to achieve that goal, I propose to establish an Investment Commission."
14928,2004-05,"The Commission will have the broad authority of the Government to engage, discuss with and invite domestic and foreign businesses to invest in India."
14929,2004-05,It will be chaired by an eminent person.
14930,2004-05,"The Foreign Investment Promotion Board FIPB has played a useful role, and even now it serves as a onestop centre for securing the nod of different ministries and departments to a proposed investment."
14931,2004-05,"Government believes 12 that many of the functions of FIPB could be put on the automatic route, and leave FIPB as a onestop service centre and facilitator."
14932,2004-05,The function of wooing domestic and foreign investors will be performed by the proposed Investment Commission.
14933,2004-05,Government proposes to set up a National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council.

14935,2004-05,The Council will be asked to suggest measures for enhancing competitiveness in the manufacturing sector.

14938,2004-05,"The NCMP declares that FDI will continue to be encouraged and actively sought, particularly in areas of infrastructure, high technology and exports."
14939,2004-05,Three sectors of the economy fully meet this description.
14940,2004-05,"They are telecommunications, civil aviation and insurance."
14941,2004-05,There is an urgent need for infusing huge amounts of capital in these sectors.
14942,2004-05,"I, therefore, propose to raise the sectoral cap for FDI in telecommunications from 49 per cent to 74 per cent; in civil aviation from 40 per cent to 49 per cent; and in insurance from 26 per cent to 49 per cent."
14943,2004-05,Government is committed to the orderly development and functioning of the capital markets.
14944,2004-05,A number of steps have been taken to broaden and deepen the capital markets as well as to strengthen the regulatory regime.
14945,2004-05,There are some signs that retail investors are returning to the capital market.
14946,2004-05,Foreign Institutional Investors FIIs have shown a marked preference for India over other emerging markets.
14947,2004-05,"In order to carry forward the process of making the Indian capital market strong and attractive, I propose to – ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ ♦ Make the procedures for registration and operations simpler and quicker for FIIs; Raise the investment ceiling for FIIs in debt funds from US$ 1 billion to US$ 1.75 billion; Allow banks with strong risk management systems greater latitude in their exposure to the capital market; Create an alternative trading platform for small and medium enterprises SMEs to raise equity and debt from the capital market; and Initiate steps to integrate the commodities markets and the securities markets."
14948,2004-05,"RBI andam also happy to announce that SEBI has been able to resolve the longstanding issue of brokers’ fees, and brokers may expect an announcement shortly."
14949,2004-05,SEBI will announce the necessary measures in respect of these matters.
14950,2004-05,Many genuine foreign institutional investors FIIs are professional bodies of asset managers and financial analysts who can enhance the flow of equity capital and lend depth to the capital markets.
14951,2004-05,An interministerial committee has 13 recommended liberalization of FII limits in certain specified sectors.
14952,2004-05,I propose to examine and implement these recommendations in consultation with the Ministries concerned.
14953,2004-05,The NCMP has declared the Government’s policy on public sector enterprises PSEs.
14954,2004-05,"While sick or ailing public sector enterprises have stirred a debate, not enough attention is paid to the healthy PSEs."
14955,2004-05,"I am happy to announce that in 2004 05 the Government will provide equity support of Rs 14,194 crore and loans of Rs 2,132 crore to Central PSEs including Railways."
14956,2004-05,"Major investments will be made in PSEs falling in the sectors of power, telecommunications, railways, roads, petroleum, coal and civil aviation."
14957,2004-05,I am sure Hon’ble Members will appreciate the deep commitment of Government to a strong and effective public sector operating in a competitive environment.
14958,2004-05,"There is, of course, another side to the public sector."
14959,2004-05,"This side is beset with problems, and we must address them with responsibility and courage."
14960,2004-05,Disinvestment and privatization are useful economic tools.
14961,2004-05,"We will selectively employ these tools, consistent with the declared policy."
14962,2004-05,"As a first step, I propose to establish a Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises BRPSE."
14963,2004-05,"The Board will advise the Government on the measures to be taken to restructure PSEs, including cases where disinvestment or closure or sale is justified."
14964,2004-05,"One of our Navaratna companies, NTPC, has filed a prospectus with SEBI to raise capital through a public issue."
14965,2004-05,"Consequently, Government’s holding in NTPC will be marginally diluted."
14966,2004-05,"In order to extract value for its holding and to compensate the effect of dilution, Government intends to piggyback on the public issue of NTPC and disinvest approximately five per cent of its holding."
14967,2004-05,This and some other cases which are under examination are expected to yield a sum of Rs 4000 crore in the current year.
14968,2004-05,"While the disinvestment revenues will be part of the Consolidated Fund of India, I shall, while presenting the Budget for 200506, report to the House the manner in which the said revenues have been or will be applied for specified social sector schemes."
14969,2004-05,The NCMP contains clear policy guidelines regarding disinvestment in PSEs.
14970,2004-05,"As long as Government retains control over the PSE, and its public sector character is not affected, Government may dilute its equity and raise resources to meet the social needs of the people."
14971,2004-05,"I propose to ask the BRPSE to examine each case objectively and make recommendations on disinvestment, consistent with the NCMP."
14972,2004-05,I am also happy to announce that I have taken the business of restructuring quite seriously.
14973,2004-05,Hindustan Antibiotics Limited will be given financial support for restructuring.
14974,2004-05,"A rescue package has been worked out for Indian Telephone Industries ITI, and ITI will be given Rs 508 crore to remain out of the net of the BIFR."
14975,2004-05,"Small scale industry is, and must be regarded as, an engine of growth."
14976,2004-05,At the same time SSI units must also be given the space to grow into medium enterprises.
14977,2004-05,"World over, policies are devised to meet the requirements of small and medium enterprises SME."
14978,2004-05,"Keeping in mind the twin objectives, the Ministry of Small Scale 14 Industry has identified 85 items that can be safely taken out of the reserved list."
14979,2004-05,"Furthermore, it is felt that technology upgradation of SSI units is the most urgent requirement to do business in a competitive environment."
14980,2004-05,"I have reviewed the Capital Subsidy Scheme, and I propose to raise the ceiling for loans under the scheme from Rs 40 lakh to Rs 1 crore."
14981,2004-05,The rate of subsidy will also be raised from 12 per cent to 15 per cent.
14982,2004-05,The scope of the scheme will be enlarged by adding more subsectors and technologies eligible for assistance.
14983,2004-05,SSI units will be encouraged to obtain credit rating.
14984,2004-05,"With these measures, I expect that many more SSI units will benefit from the restructured scheme."
14985,2004-05,"A provision of Rs  135.24 crore has been made for “Promotion of SSI Schemes”, and within that amount funds will be found for the Capital Subsidy Scheme."
14986,2004-05,Regeneration of traditional industries 6 8 .
14987,2004-05,"Some of our traditional industries, namely coir, handloom, handicrafts, sericulture, leather, pottery and other cottage industries not only contain great potential for growth and exports, but are integral for the maintenance of our cultural heritage."
14988,2004-05,"Accordingly, a Fund for the Regeneration of Traditional Industries, with an initial allocation of Rs 100 crore will be set up."
14989,2004-05,"The details, including mechanism for utilization of the fund will be worked out in consultation with the industries concerned."
14990,2004-05,X. OTHER PROPOSALS VAT 69.
14991,2004-05,"Valueadded tax is a tax that has been tested and tried, and found beneficial throughout the world."
14992,2004-05,The country needs a modern and efficient trade tax system that incorporates the international best practices.
14993,2004-05,"At the June 18, 2004 meeting of the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, to which all Finance Ministers were invited, and chaired by my distinguished friend Dr. Asim Das Gupta, there was a broad consensus among the States to implement VAT."
14994,2004-05,"April 1, 2005 has been set as the date for implementation."
14995,2004-05,I welcome the decision and warmly congratulate the State Governments.
14996,2004-05,I urge all States that have not yet passed the relevant VAT legislation to do so before the end of 2004.
14997,2004-05,"International experience, as well as the experience of the State of Haryana, suggests that VAT will lead to an increase in revenue and not a loss in revenue."
14998,2004-05,"Nevertheless, in order to give comfort to the States, I propose to evolve a formula for determining the compensation for the loss of revenue, if any."
14999,2004-05,I have offered the States the services of a Technical Experts Committee.
15000,2004-05,"The Committee will work with the States closely, and help them move steadily towards the stage of implementation."
15001,2004-05,"A ‘defined contribution’ pension scheme has been introduced with effect from January 1, 2004 for the Central Government employees recruited on or after that date."
15002,2004-05,A suitable legislation to provide a regulatory framework for the scheme will be introduced in Parliament.
15003,2004-05,"My colleague, the Minister of Commerce and Industry, will place before Parliament by the end of this month a new trade policy."
15004,2004-05,"Government is of the view that Special Economic Zones SEZs are growth engines that can boost manufacturing, exports 15 and employment."
15005,2004-05,The private sector has shown considerable interest in the development of SEZs.
15006,2004-05,Five SEZs have started functioning.
15007,2004-05,SEZs require a special fiscal and regulatory regime.
15008,2004-05,"The Commerce Minister will, shortly, introduce a Bill for regulating Special Economic Zones, and it is my belief that the passing of such a law would be a significant milestone in our quest to become a major hub for manufacturing and exports."
15009,2004-05,"The constitutional validity of the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 has been upheld by the Supreme Court, except SubSection 2 of Section 17."
15010,2004-05,"In the wake of this judgement, many banks have pointed out practical difficulties likely to arise in speeding up the recovery of nonperforming assets."
15011,2004-05,"It is proposed to amend the relevant provisions of the Act to appropriately address the Supreme Court’s concerns regarding a fair deal to borrowers while, at the same time, ensuring that the recovery process is not delayed or hampered."
15012,2004-05,"Related amendments to the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993, if necessary, will also be made."
15013,2004-05,The Central Government has saved considerably on interest on fresh borrowings because of moderate interest rates.
15014,2004-05,The States were also able to borrow at lower rates and swap old high cost loans.
15015,2004-05,"Since 2002, States have benefited to the extent of nearly Rs 2500 crore through the debt swap scheme."
15016,2004-05,"While borrowers are benefited by moderate interest rates, there is a need to boost savings and to protect the savers."
15017,2004-05,"I am convinced that, in the larger interests of the country, we should maintain a benign interest rate regime that appropriately balances the legitimate claims of the savers and borrowers."
15018,2004-05,"I believe that all interest rates should be aligned to the market, save for one or two exceptions."
15019,2004-05,There is a need for a savings instrument that will give a return to senior citizens which is above the marketdetermined rate.
15020,2004-05,"There is also a need for an instrument that will provide a riskfree avenue for all citizens to save for a longer term, and such an instrument should bear a slightly higher rate of interest."
15021,2004-05,"Balancing these considerations, I do not propose to make any change in the existing rates of interest on small savings instruments."
15022,2004-05,"Consequently, PPF, GPF and the Special Deposit Scheme will attract 8 per cent interest this year."
15023,2004-05,"For senior citizens, I propose to introduce a new scheme called the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme offering an interest rate of 9 per cent per annum."
15024,2004-05,"For all other citizens, I propose to continue the Government Savings bond which will carry an interest rate of 8 per cent per annum."
15025,2004-05,The Varishta Pension Bima Yojana may no longer be necessary since the new savings scheme will cover the senior citizens adequately.
15026,2004-05,Reform of Public Distribution System 75.
15027,2004-05,"In the Tenth Plan document, the Planning Commission had suggested that a system of distributing food stamps should be tested on a pilot basis."
15028,2004-05,"Every eligible family will be entitled to collect its monthly quota of food stamps from a designated distribution centre, and such stamps could then be used to buy foodgrains from any food shop."
15029,2004-05,"I propose to introduce a pilot scheme for distributing food stamps, instead 16 of distributing food through fair price shops, in two or three contiguous districts in a selected State."
15030,2004-05,I sincerely hope that one of the States will come forward to associate with the Central Government in this experiment.
15031,2004-05,Women’s groups have met me and urged me to consider gender budgeting.
15032,2004-05,This means that the budget data should be presented in a manner that the gender sensitivities of the budgetary allocations are clearly highlighted.
15033,2004-05,"An expert group on “Classification System of Government Transactions” has submitted its report on July 6, 2004."
15034,2004-05,It has recommended appropriate systems for data collection and representation in the budget.
15035,2004-05,The group has also recommended introduction of periodic benefit incidence analysis.
15036,2004-05,"Government will examine the recommendations, and I hope it will be possible for me to implement some of them in the Budget for 200506."
15037,2004-05,"Seven years ago, I placed before Parliament the first paper on subsidies."
15038,2004-05,"The NCMP pledges that all subsidies will be targeted sharply at the poor and truly needy like small and marginal farmers, farm labour and the urban poor."
15039,2004-05,I have asked the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy NIPFP to prepare a blue print to accomplish these objectives.
15040,2004-05,I expect to place the report before the House in the next session of Parliament.
15041,2004-05,"In order to support the States, a substantial proportion of the taxes raised by the Central Government is transferred to the States."
15042,2004-05,"Besides, the Central Government extends loans to the States."
15043,2004-05,"In the light of the Budget Estimates for the current year, I am happy to report that the States’ share of Union taxes and duties will increase to Rs 82,227 crore from Rs 63,758 crore in BE 200304."
15044,2004-05,We are helping the States in other ways too.
15045,2004-05,One of them is the Debt Swap Scheme.
15046,2004-05,I propose to extend the facility of debt swap by allowing States to raise fresh loans and repay their old highcost loans to NABARD and some other agencies.
15047,2004-05,I also propose to consult the States on allowing them to increase their open market borrowings and reduce their dependence on loans from the Central Government.
15048,2004-05,I shall also consider passing on external loans to the States on a backtoback basis.
15049,2004-05,We are moving in the direction of empowering the States through devolution of larger resources.
15050,2004-05,It is my fervent hope that States will accept the obligation to observe fiscal prudence and financial discipline.
15051,2004-05,Loans given by the Central Government to States carried an interest rate of 12.5 per cent.
15052,2004-05,"In 200304, the rate was reduced to 10.5 per cent."
15053,2004-05,I am happy to announce a further reduction.
15054,2004-05,"Loans to the States will now bear an interest rate of 9 per cent with effect from April 1, 2004."
15055,2004-05,States are expected to benefit to the tune of Rs 375 crore this year alone.
15056,2004-05,"The NCMP promises that special economic packages for Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir and the North Eastern States, announced in the past, will be implemented expeditiously."
15057,2004-05,"Bihar, for example, has a number of projects pending for a long time, including projects in power, roads, drainage and rehabilitation of displaced persons."
15058,2004-05,"A provision of Rs 3225 crore has been made for the present and, if necessary, this sum will be augmented."
15059,2004-05,North Eastern Region NER 82.
15060,2004-05,The Government is committed to the speedy development of the NorthEastern States and Sikkim.
15061,2004-05,"Accordingly, all Ministries and Departments have been mandated to allocate at least 10 per cent of their Plan budget for schemes and programmes in the NER."
15062,2004-05,This amounts to an allocation of Rs 5823 crore to be spent in the NER.
15063,2004-05,The amount remaining unspent from this 10 per cent allocation is transferred to a nonlapsable Central pool of resources for development of the NER.
15064,2004-05,"In the current year, Rs 650 crore have been provided from the Central pool of resources for specific projects and schemes in this region, up from Rs 550 crore in 200304."
15065,2004-05,The Government will provide special assistance to the State of Jammu & Kashmir to have a reasonable Plan size.
15066,2004-05,It will also provide financial support for the long pending Baglihar project.
15067,2004-05,The Government has also agreed to provide a grant of Rs 300 crore to the State to ensure smooth switchover from the current overdraft arrangement with the Bank of Jammu & Kashmir to the Ways & Means scheme of the RBI.
15068,2004-05,Backward States’ Commission 84.
15069,2004-05,NCMP envisages the creation of a Backward States Grant Commission to be used for creating productive assets in such States.
15070,2004-05,"It also envisages that all non statutory resource transfers from the Central Government will be weighed in favour of poor and backward States, but with performance parameters as well."
15071,2004-05,"I am happy to announce that the Government will set up a Backward States Grant Fund with a corpus of Rs 25,000 crore to be provided over a period of five years."
15072,2004-05,"While the existing Backward Districts Initiative Scheme with an annual outlay of about Rs 1,800 crore will be merged into this Grant Fund, the balance amount required for the annual contribution of Rs 5,000 crore will be earmarked from out of the total Central support to the Plan."
15073,2004-05,It is expected that this will enable taking up social and physical infrastructure programmes in the poorest and most backward districts in the country within a given time frame.
15074,2004-05,The Fund will become operational from the financial year 200506.
15075,2004-05,Further details will be worked out in consultation with the Planning Commission.
15076,2004-05,"As promised in the NCMP, the Government is determined to eliminate all delays in the modernization of the Defence Forces."
15077,2004-05,"Having regard to the trend of defence capital expenditure in recent years, it has become necessary to make a higher allocation this year."
15078,2004-05,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the allocation for Defence to Rs 77,000 crore as against Rs 65,300 crore in BE 200304 which includes an allocation for capital expenditure of Rs 33,483 crore as against Rs 20,953 crore in BE 200304."
15079,2004-05,Budget Estimates for 20042005 87.
15080,2004-05,"Now, I turn to the budget estimates for the current year."
15081,2004-05,"While preparing the Budget, I found that there is a plethora of Plan schemes."
15082,2004-05,"The number, the variety and even the acronyms under which these schemes are known are mindboggling."
15083,2004-05,I also found that there are many schemes with more or less the same objectives.
15084,2004-05,"In some cases, all the schemes were located in one ministry or department; in other cases, they were distributed among different ministries or departments."
15085,2004-05,"Plan schemes can be broadly divided into three categories – Central Sector, State Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes."
15086,2004-05,"The NCMP requires that all Centrally Sponsored Schemes, except national priority areas like family planning, shall be transferred to the States."
15087,2004-05,"Fortunately, a new Planning Commission is in place, and I am confident that the Planning Commission will bring some order into the tangled web of schemes."
15088,2004-05,"Plan expenditure for 200405 is estimated at Rs 145,590 crore as against Rs 122,149 crore in the provisional actuals for 200304."
15089,2004-05,"While there is an increase in plan revenue expenditure from Rs 78,537 crore in 200304 to Rs 91,843 crore, there is an even sharper and welcome increase in plan capital expenditure from Rs 43,612 crore in 200304 to Rs 53,747 crore."
15090,2004-05,"Nonplan expenditure in 200405 is estimated to be Rs 332,239 crore, lower than Rs 349,787 crore in the provisional actuals for 200304 which includes capital expenditure of Rs 46,211 crore on repayment to the National Small Savings Fund."
15091,2004-05,"The increase in nonplan expenditure from the interim Budget is mainly on account of capital expenditure in defence Rs 11,000 crore, and assistance to Indian Telephone Industries Ltd."
15092,2004-05,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit 91.
15093,2004-05,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 200405, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 477,829 crore, of which Rs 145,590 crore is for Plan and Rs 332,239 crore for nonPlan."
15094,2004-05,"I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs 309,322 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs 385,493 crore."
15095,2004-05,"Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs 76,171 crore equivalent to 2.5 per cent of GDP, which is one percentage point below the corresponding estimate of 3.5 per cent of GDP in 200304 according to the provisional actuals."
15096,2004-05,"The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 137,407 crore, which is 4.4 per cent of the estimated GDP."
15097,2004-05,I shall now deal with my tax proposals.
15098,2004-05,Taxation is a key tool of fiscal policy.
15099,2004-05,"The NCMP has promised that “tax rates will be stable and conducive to growth, compliance and investment”."
15100,2004-05,"Thanks to policies initiated in the 1990s, direct tax rates are now moderate and require only fine tuning from time to time."
15101,2004-05,Indirect taxes have also been moderated through a calibrated reduction in customs and excise duties.
15102,2004-05,The proportion of direct tax XI.
15103,2004-05,TAX PROPOSALS 19 revenues to GDP has increased from 1.9 per cent in 199091 to 3.8 per cent in 2003 04.
15104,2004-05,"As expected, the proportion of indirect tax revenues to GDP has declined from 7.9 per cent in 199091, but the decline has been rather sharp with the proportion at 5.3 per cent in 200304."
15105,2004-05,The weak spot is central excise.
15106,2004-05,"Excise revenues are stuck, rather stubbornly, at around 3.3 per cent of GDP."
15107,2004-05,"While reduction in excise duty rates partly accounts for this situation, the expansion of the manufacturing industry ought to have given us larger revenues."
15108,2004-05,"Through my policies on taxation, I wish to signal that we remain committed to moderation and stability in tax rates; that we remain committed to increasing revenues from direct taxes and excise duties; and that we remain committed to expanding the service tax net because the services sector accounts for 51 per cent of GDP."
15109,2004-05,I shall also use tax policies to provide incentives to certain kinds of investment and to influence certain kinds of behaviour in the market.
15110,2004-05,I am a votary of tax reforms but it would be unwise on my part to attempt to do tax reform in a hurried or piecemeal manner.
15111,2004-05,"Seven months from now there will be another Budget, and there will be an occasion to visit the subject of tax reform."
15112,2004-05,I shall begin with my direct tax proposals.
15113,2004-05,Let me give you the good news first.
15114,2004-05,"No one with a taxable income of Rs 100,000 will be required to pay any income tax any more."
15115,2004-05,It was not easy to reach this decision.
15116,2004-05,"While the tax rates are moderate, it is the tax slabs which cause concern."
15117,2004-05,"However, I am unable to alter the tax slabs because I cannot afford to lose a large amount of revenue at a time when the Government has assumed a larger responsibility for investment and welfare programmes."
15118,2004-05,"Out of nearly 3.4 crore persons filing income tax returns, only 2.7 crore assessees are taxpayers."
15119,2004-05,My proposal will give relief to 1.4 crore assessees.
15120,2004-05,The method that I have adopted is somewhat novel.
15121,2004-05,"While everyone will file his return according to the current tax slabs and tax rates, and compute his taxable income and the tax payable, any one with a taxable income of Rs 100,000 will have his income tax liability automatically rebated."
15122,2004-05,"I cannot give more relief, or relief across the Board, in this Budget."
15123,2004-05,"If compliance improves, I promise to revisit the subject."
15124,2004-05,I propose to give relief to certain sections of deserving tax payers.
15125,2004-05,"Accordingly, I propose to exempt from income tax the family pension received by widows, children and nominated heirs of members of the armed forces and the paramilitary forces killed in the course of operational duties."
15126,2004-05,This is my humble salute to their supreme sacrifice.
15127,2004-05,"I propose to extend the benefit of Section 80DD and Section 80U in respect of persons suffering from autism, cerebral palsy and multiple disability."
15128,2004-05,Farmers have brought to my notice that agricultural land situated in certain urban agglomerations fall under the definition of capital asset and the compensation for acquisition of such land is subjected to capital gains tax.
15129,2004-05,Such compensation deserves to be exempted from capital gains tax.
15130,2004-05,"I propose to do so in cases where the compensation or the enhanced compensation has been received on or after April 1, 2004."
15131,2004-05,"A new ‘defined contribution’ pension scheme for new entrants into Central Government service has come into effect from January 1, 2004."
15132,2004-05,The tax treatment of contributions made to the scheme has engaged the attention of Government.
15133,2004-05,"I propose to adopt the universally accepted formula of EET: that is, the contributions will be excluded from income for tax purposes; the accruals will also be exempt from tax; and only the terminal benefits will be taxed at the applicable rate in the year of receipt."
15134,2004-05,I propose to withdraw a few exemptions which have outlived their utility.
15135,2004-05,Interest earned from a NonResident External Account and interest paid by banks to a NonResident or to a NotOrdinarily Resident on deposits in foreign currency will not be exempt from tax.
15136,2004-05,"Similarly, any payment made by an Indian company to acquire an aircraft or an aircraft engine on lease from a foreign state or a foreign enterprise will not be exempt from tax."
15137,2004-05,"These exemptions will cease prospectively from September 1, 2004."
15138,2004-05,Hon’ble Members are aware that I abolished the gift tax in 1997.
15139,2004-05,"That decision remains, but a loophole requires to be plugged to prevent money laundering."
15140,2004-05,"Accordingly, purported gifts from unrelated persons, above the threshold limit of Rs 25,000, will now be taxed as income."
15141,2004-05,"Gifts received from blood relations, lineal ascendants and lineal descendants, and gifts received on certain occasions like marriage will continue to be totally exempt."
15142,2004-05,"In order to promote agroprocessing industries, I propose to amend Section 80 IB of the Act to allow a deduction of 100 per cent of profits for 5 years and 25 per cent of profits for the next 5 years in the case of new agroprocessing industries set up to process, preserve and package fruits and vegetables."
15143,2004-05,Investment in the manufacturing sector deserves the Government’s attention.
15144,2004-05,"Hence, I propose to continue with the additional depreciation of 15 per cent allowed under Section 321iia on new plant and machinery acquired or installed in an existing undertaking; however, the required increase in installed capacity will now be 10 per cent, and not 25 per cent."
15145,2004-05,The automobile sector has done well and needs to be encouraged.
15146,2004-05,I therefore propose to notify the automobile industry as an industry entitled to 150 per cent deduction of expenditure on inhouse R&D facilities.
15147,2004-05,The power sector also deserves tax concessions.
15148,2004-05,"The Electricity Act 2003 envisages unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution."
15149,2004-05,"In order to promote renovation and modernization of existing transmission and distribution lines, I propose to extend the benefit under Section 80 IA to projects undertaken during the period April 1, 2004 to March 31, 2006."
15150,2004-05,The shipping industry has demanded the levy of a tonnage tax to make it intentionally competitive.
15151,2004-05,Tonnage tax will also induce more ships to fly the Indian flag.
15152,2004-05,I propose to accept the request.
15153,2004-05,"Consequently, the concessional regime under Section 33 AC will be withdrawn and shipping companies will now have only an option to pay the tonnage tax or normal corporate tax on profits."
15154,2004-05,I propose to extend the benefit of Section 80 IB to new hospitals with 100 beds or more set up in rural areas.
15155,2004-05,Such hospitals will be entitled to a 100 per cent deduction of their profits for a period of five years.
15156,2004-05,"The housing industry enjoys certain benefits under Section 80 IB for projects approved before March 31, 2005."
15157,2004-05,"I propose to extend the time limit to March 31, 2007."
15158,2004-05,A small problem has plagued the reconstruction and development of existing buildings under approved plans in the city of Mumbai.
15159,2004-05,Perhaps the problem is there in some other cities too.
15160,2004-05,"I, therefore, propose to relax the condition of minimum plot size of one acre in the case of housing projects, as long as the projects are implemented in accordance with a scheme for reconstruction or development approved by the Central or State Government."
15161,2004-05,Capital gains tax is another vexed issue.
15162,2004-05,"When applied to capital market transactions, the issue becomes more complex."
15163,2004-05,"Questions have been raised about the definitions of longterm and shortterm, and the differential tax treatment meted to the two kinds of gains."
15164,2004-05,"There are no easy answers, but I have decided to make a beginning by revamping taxes on securities transactions."
15165,2004-05,Our founding fathers had wisely included entry 90 in the Union List in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.
15166,2004-05,"Taking a cue from that entry, I propose to abolish the tax on longterm capital gains from securities transactions altogether."
15167,2004-05,"Instead, I propose to levy a small tax on transactions in securities on stock exchanges."
15168,2004-05,The rate will be 0.15 per cent of the value of security.
15169,2004-05,"Thus, a transaction involving securities valued at, say, Rs 100,000 will now bear a small tax of Rs 150."
15170,2004-05,The tax will be levied on the buyer.
15171,2004-05,"In the case of shortterm capital gains from securities, I propose to reduce the rate of tax to a flat rate of 10 per cent."
15172,2004-05,My calculation shows that the new tax regime will be a winwin situation for all concerned.
15173,2004-05,I propose to make a change in the tax on dividends distributed by mutual funds.
15174,2004-05,Equityoriented mutual funds will continue to be exempt from tax.
15175,2004-05,Debt oriented mutual funds are now required to withhold 12.5 per cent of the income distributed to unit holders.
15176,2004-05,Individuals and HUF unit holders will continue to enjoy the benefit of this rate.
15177,2004-05,"However, in the case of corporate unit holders, I propose a rate of 20 per cent."
15178,2004-05,"I am sure corporates will understand, because I am doing no more than partially closing a window of arbitrage opportunity."
15179,2004-05,I propose to put an end to bonusstripping and dividendstripping in units by making a suitable amendment to Section 94 of the Act.
15180,2004-05,I also propose some measures to widen the tax base and to plug revenue leakage.
15181,2004-05,I do not wish to take the time of the House detailing each measure.
15182,2004-05,Tax deduction at source TDS and tax collection at source TCS are being extended to some more activities.
15183,2004-05,Amendments are proposed to Section 40ai and Section 194 C. 1 1 6 .
15184,2004-05,"The telecom sector enjoyed certain benefits under Section 80 IA for services commenced before March 31, 2004."
15185,2004-05,"Pending a detailed examination of the needs of the telecom sector, I propose to extend the terminal date to March 31, 2005."
15186,2004-05,"Companies carrying on scientific research and development and approved by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research before April 1, 2004 are entitled to 100 per cent deduction of profits for 10 years."
15187,2004-05,"On the request of the Department of BioTechnology and pending a detailed examination, I propose to extend the terminal date to March 31, 2005."
15188,2004-05,"New industrial undertakings in Jammu & Kashmir enjoyed 100 per cent tax exemption if they commenced production before March 31, 2004."
15189,2004-05,"Pending a detailed examination of the incentives required to promote industrial development in Jammu & Kashmir, I propose to extend the date to March 31, 2005."
15190,2004-05,Indirect taxes 1 1 9 .
15191,2004-05,"Now, I turn to my indirect tax proposals."
15192,2004-05,The policy signal that needs to be reiterated is that customs duties will be brought down in a measured way.
15193,2004-05,It is my intention to align India’s tariff structure to those of ASEAN countries.
15194,2004-05,"Eventually, there should be a uniform rate of tax on goods and services."
15195,2004-05,"During the last four years, my predecessors had adjusted excise duties and moved them towards a Central VAT rate."
15196,2004-05,The most important goods in the manufacturing sector must therefore bear an excise duty of 16 per cent.
15197,2004-05,"Another principle that requires to be emphasized is that where an excise duty is levied, subject to only a few exceptions, like goods when imported should attract an equivalent countervailing duty CVD."
15198,2004-05,"In my tax proposals, I have, therefore, removed the exemption from CVD enjoyed by some imported goods where there is no corresponding exemption from excise duty on Indian made goods."
15199,2004-05,I may also point out that customs tariffs and excise duties are interrelated.
15200,2004-05,"While considering the tax regime for any sector, one must look at both customs duties and excise duties applicable to that sector."
15201,2004-05,The peak rate of customs duty was reduced to 20 per cent in January 2004.
15202,2004-05,I propose to maintain the peak rate for the rest of the current fiscal year.
15203,2004-05,"I shall now deal with specific sectors beginning with metals, minerals and industrial raw materials."
15204,2004-05,Steel is the leading metal.
15205,2004-05,"Normally, it should bear an excise duty of 16 per cent."
15206,2004-05,"However, in February this year, excise duty on steel was reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent, but with the caveat that the decision will be reviewed when the regular budget is presented."
15207,2004-05,"Belying expectations, steel prices have not moderated but have risen sharply."
15208,2004-05,I propose to reduce the customs duty on nonalloy steel from 15 per cent to 10 per cent and to increase the excise duty on steel from 8 per cent to 12 per cent so that the countervailing duty will also be applicable to imports.
15209,2004-05,I hope to recoup some of the revenue losses since February 2004.
15210,2004-05,"Alloy steel, copper, lead, zinc and base metals are basic raw materials used in a variety of industries."
15211,2004-05,I propose to reduce the peak rate on such metals to 15 per cent.
15212,2004-05,"I also propose to reduce the customs duties on refractory raw minerals and mineral products like graphite, asbestos, mica and gypsum to 15 per cent."
15213,2004-05,The customs duty on all catalysts will also be 15 per cent.
15214,2004-05,"To encourage value addition, while retaining customs duty on crude palm oil at 65 per cent, I propose to 23 accept the recommendation of the Tariff Commission and increase the duty on refined palm oil to 75 per cent."
15215,2004-05,Some items of plantation machinery attract a customs duty of 5 per cent.
15216,2004-05,I propose to extend the concessional rate to more items pertaining to the tea and coffee plantation sector.
15217,2004-05,"On the excise front, I propose to make a number of concessions."
15218,2004-05,Tractors attract an excise duty of 16 per cent.
15219,2004-05,"Hereafter, tractors will be fully exempt."
15220,2004-05,"Likewise, dairy machinery which attracts an excise duty of 16 per cent will be fully exempt."
15221,2004-05,"Hand tools such as spades, shovels, sickles etc, which currently attract a 16 per cent excise duty will also be fully exempt."
15222,2004-05,"Excise duty on preparations of meat, poultry and fish will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent and excise duty on food grade hexane used in the edible oil industry will be reduced from 32 per cent to 16 per cent."
15223,2004-05,I propose to give some concessions to the health sector.
15224,2004-05,A number of items for the disabled are already exempt from import duties or attract a concessional duty of 5 per cent.
15225,2004-05,"I propose that rehabilitation aids such as talking books, braille computer terminals, braille writers and typewriters, assistive listening devices, cochlear implants and stair lifts be fully exempt from customs duty."
15226,2004-05,They will also be exempt from excise duty and CVD.
15227,2004-05,"Crutches, wheel chairs, walking frames, artificial limbs, etc. for the disabled will also be fully exempt from customs duty."
15228,2004-05,There are some restrictions on institutions for the visuallyimpaired and the hearingimpaired availing of import duty exemptions.
15229,2004-05,I propose to remove these restrictions as well as enlarge the list of exempted appliances.
15230,2004-05,Ambulances used by government and municipal hospitals alone have been allowed the concessional excise duty of 16 per cent.
15231,2004-05,I propose that all ambulances registered as such will be entitled to this benefit.
15232,2004-05,Diagnostic kits for detecting hepatitis B alone are exempt from excise duty.
15233,2004-05,I propose to extend the exemption to kits for detection of all types of hepatitis.
15234,2004-05,"In order to move toward the Cenvat rate, I propose to levy excise duty on contact lenses and playing cards."
15235,2004-05,"I also propose to increase the excise duty from 8 per cent to 16 per cent on a few items including vaccum flasks, plastic insulated ware, scented supari, prefabricated buildings, laboratory glassware, black and white television sets, populated PCBs, imitation jewellery, candles and parts of clocks and watches."
15236,2004-05,"Let me hasten to add that in all these cases the general SSI exemption will continue to be available, and consumers and small manufacturers will not be affected at all."
15237,2004-05,Even other manufacturers will avail of Cenvat credit.
15238,2004-05,"In order to protect matches made in the nonmechanised sector, I propose to increase the excise duty on matches made in the mechanized/semimechanised sector from 8 per cent without Cenvat credit to 16 per cent with Cenvat credit."
15239,2004-05,"The Information Technology sector has, by and large, been kept out of the reach of the tax collector."
15240,2004-05,"Under the Information Technology Agreement, customs duty will be brought down to zero in 2005."
15241,2004-05,"Meanwhile, I propose to abide by the bound rates under the agreement."
15242,2004-05,"I propose to exempt specified raw materials for manufacture of parts of cathode ray tubes and specified capital goods for manufacture of mobile handsets, plasma 24 display panels etc. from excise duty."
15243,2004-05,Specified items for manufacture of telecom grade optical fibres and cables are also proposed to be exempt from customs duty.
15244,2004-05,Mobile switching centres imported by cellular mobile telephone service providers are now exempt from customs duty.
15245,2004-05,I propose to extend the exemption to imports by universal access service providers.
15246,2004-05,Computers attract excise duty of 8 per cent.
15247,2004-05,I propose to grant full exemption.
15248,2004-05,"I propose to give some excise relief to LPG gas stoves bearing an MRP up to Rs 2000, footwear with MRP upto Rs 250 and writing instruments with MRP upto"
15249,2004-05,I propose to reduce the excise duty on amusement rides from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.
15250,2004-05,"Having been Commerce Minister, export promotion is close to my heart."
15251,2004-05,I propose to extend the concessional customs duty of 5 per cent on capital goods enjoyed by the leather industry to the nonleather footwear industry too.
15252,2004-05,Finished leather of all kinds is exempt from customs duty.
15253,2004-05,I propose to exempt patent leather also.
15254,2004-05,Platinum is a serious challenger to gold in the jewellery industry.
15255,2004-05,Both should be treated alike.
15256,2004-05,"Hence, I propose to reduce the import duty on platinum from Rs 550 per 10 grams to Rs 200."
15257,2004-05,I propose that rough coloured precious gemstones should be exempt from customs duty just as rough semiprecious stones are.
15258,2004-05,Area specific exemptions from excise duty have been granted from time to time.
15259,2004-05,The North Eastern States and J&K are in a class by themselves.
15260,2004-05,The exemptions enjoyed by them will continue.
15261,2004-05,"Sikkim, Uttaranchal and Himachal Pradesh were also granted areabased exemptions."
15262,2004-05,Hon’ble Members are fully aware of the arguments in favour and the rival arguments against.
15263,2004-05,I have to be fair to both sides.
15264,2004-05,"Accordingly, I propose that area specific exemptions enjoyed by States other than the North Eastern States and J & K will continue and be available to units set up or expanded on or before March 31, 2007."
15265,2004-05,I shall now deal with the most challenging tax problem that I faced this year.
15266,2004-05,This relates to the textile sector.
15267,2004-05,"Last year, handlooms and powerlooms were brought into what is described as the Cenvat chain."
15268,2004-05,"The intention was good but, I am afraid, the decision did not take into account the decentralized and fragmented nature of production of fabrics in the country."
15269,2004-05,"Besides, the socalled Cenvat chain had nearly 40 exemptions at different stages."
15270,2004-05,"In fact, two exemptions were added after the decision."
15271,2004-05,"I am conscious that the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing will come to an end on December 31, 2004."
15272,2004-05,"Our textile sector must, therefore, be made more efficient and competitive."
15273,2004-05,"Those who can compete because of their organizational strength should be allowed to compete; for the rest, we must allow more time to comply with a mandatory tax regime."
15274,2004-05,"Meanwhile, there must be a level playing field."
15275,2004-05,"If I have understood correctly the mind of Hon’ble Members of Parliament, and of the leaders of various political parties, I believe that there is a universal demand 25 to free the handloom and powerloom sectors from the Cenvat regime."
15276,2004-05,"After giving my anxious consideration to the complex issues, I propose to withdraw the mandatory Cenvat duty."
15277,2004-05,"Instead, I propose to introduce a new tax regime for the textile sector and, in this exercise, I am happy to say that I have the full support of the Minister of Textiles."
15278,2004-05,Let me now explain briefly the new regime.
15279,2004-05,Every manufacturer – be it handloom or powerloom or composite mill – will have the option to choose between two routes.
15280,2004-05,One will be the exemption route and the other will be the Cenvat route.
15281,2004-05,"Under the exemption route, no excise duty will be payable at any stage except on manmade fibre and filament yarn."
15282,2004-05,"Under the Cenvat route, credit can be taken for all excise duties paid at earlier stages."
15283,2004-05,"For the purposes of the optional Cenvat route, it is necessary to specify in the Tariff schedule the applicable excise duty rates."
15284,2004-05,"For the pure cotton sector, the uniform rate will be 4 per cent on yarn, fabrics, garments and madeups."
15285,2004-05,"For the blended textiles sector and pure noncotton sector, the uniform rate will be 8 per cent."
15286,2004-05,It is my firm belief that the millions of handloom weavers and powerloom weavers will welcome the new regime.
15287,2004-05,"As far as the composite mills are concerned, there is no cause for worry."
15288,2004-05,"They are also free to take the exemption route, but if they choose to opt for the Cenvat route, they may do so and claim Cenvat credit for all duties paid at earlier stages."
15289,2004-05,Garment exporters should give the new regime a fair chance.
15290,2004-05,I expect that prices of fabrics will moderate and garment exporters will stand to benefit.
15291,2004-05,"Their concerns, if any, can be addressed through the drawback or DEPB mechanism."
15292,2004-05,"In course of time, it is possible that some manufacturers of handlooms and powerlooms will take advantage of the low uniform rates of duty and opt for the Cenvat route."
15293,2004-05,There remains the service tax.
15294,2004-05,I propose to take a major step towards integrating the tax on goods and services.
15295,2004-05,"Accordingly, I propose to extend credit of service tax and excise duty across goods and services."
15296,2004-05,"In order to neutralize the revenue impact of such extension, and keeping in mind the mean Cenvat rate, I propose to enhance the rate of service tax from 8 per cent to 10 per cent."
15297,2004-05,I propose to add some more this year.
15298,2004-05,These are business exhibition services; airport services; services provided by transport booking agents; transport of goods by air; survey and exploration 26 services; opinion poll services; intellectual property services other than copy right; brokers of forward contracts; pandal and shamiana contractors; outdoor caterers; independent TV/radio programme producers; construction services in respect of commercial or industrial constructions; and life insurance services to the extent of the risk premium.
15299,2004-05,I may clarify that there is no intention to levy service tax on truck owners or truck operators.
15300,2004-05,"Nor, as was clarified by my predecessor, is there any intention to levy service tax on the savings part of the premium collected by an insurer."
15301,2004-05,"I also propose that some currently taxable services should be redefined to cover all service providers falling under the same category, but I do not wish to burden this speech with the details."
15302,2004-05,Exemptions granted in the case of some taxable services are proposed to be removed.
15303,2004-05,The administration of service tax will be made more taxpayerfriendly.
15304,2004-05,I propose to do away with the mandatory verification of self assessment and the mandatory penalty for nonregistration.
15305,2004-05,"Finally, there is the tax mandated by the NCMP."
15306,2004-05,That is an education cess on all taxes.
15307,2004-05,"I propose to levy a cess of 2 per cent on income tax, corporation tax, excise duties, customs duties and service tax."
15308,2004-05,"Besides my tax proposals, I have looked at another source of revenue."
15309,2004-05,There are large recoverable arrears both in direct taxes and indirect taxes.
15310,2004-05,Even the undisputed arrears are quite substantial.
15311,2004-05,"I have, therefore, assumed that I would be able to recover a tidy sum this year."
15312,2004-05,"A special, multipronged drive will be made to recover these arrears, the details of which will be announced later."
15313,2004-05,My tax proposals on direct taxes are expected to yield a gain of Rs 2000 crore.
15314,2004-05,"On the indirect taxes side, they are broadly revenue neutral."
15315,2004-05,XII. CONCLUSION 1 5 4 .
15316,2004-05,"The countries of the world, India included, have set for themselves the Millennium Development Goals."
15317,2004-05,"Our date with destiny is not at the end of the millennium, but in the year 2015."
15318,2004-05,Will we achieve those goals?
15319,2004-05,"In the eleven years that remain, it is in our hands to shape our destiny."
15320,2004-05,"Progress is not always on a linear path, nor is it inevitable."
15321,2004-05,"Two thousand years ago, Saint Tirvalluvar said: “Aran Izhukkathu Allavai Neeki"
15322,2004-05,Maran Izhukka Maanam Udayathu Arasu”
15323,2004-05,"They are good rulers who observe ethics, commit no crime and walk the path of honour and courage If we bring thought and passion to our goverance, and walk the path of honour and courage, we can make the future happen."
15324,2004-05,And this century will be India’s century.
15325,2004-05,"Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
15326,2005-06,I rise to present the Budget for the year 200506.
15327,2005-06,"Last year, while presenting the Budget, I had suggested that the vote in Elections 2004 was a vote for change."
15328,2005-06,"It was, I believe, a vote in favour of a new leadership; a new Government; new policies; and a new focus on the common citizen who is at the centre of all politics and governance."
15329,2005-06,"I reaffirm my belief, and I also declare my conviction that the UPA Government under Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh has charted a new path that is more acceptable to the people of the country and that will bring the greatest good to the greatest number."
15330,2005-06,"Before I turn to the business of the day, I wish to record Government’s deep sorrow on the loss of lives, property and livelihood caused by the tsunami tragedy."
15331,2005-06,"So far, Government has approved relief packages amounting to Rs 3,644 crore."
15332,2005-06,"The Planning Commission, which is coordinating the Tsunami Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Programme, has drawn up a programme at an estimated cost of Rs 10,216 crore."
15333,2005-06,"I wish to assure the House, and the affected people, that the Government will provide the necessary funds for the purpose and ensure that every affected family is fully rehabilitated."
15334,2005-06,BACKDROP The Immediate Past: Where We Were in 200304 5.
15335,2005-06,"In May 2004, the UPA Government inherited an economy that had, as we now know, registered a growth rate of 8.5 per cent in 200304 on the back of 2 a poor 4 per cent in the previous year."
15336,2005-06,"While growth was indeed broadbased, the impressive growth rate was due largely to the restoration of output in the agriculture and allied sector."
15337,2005-06,"I had then commented that my immediate predecessor was a very lucky man, even while his predecessor was not!"
15338,2005-06,"Notwithstanding the high growth rate, there were several disturbing trends which came to notice in May 2004."
15339,2005-06,The first was the liquidity overhang at the end of 200304 which had spilled over into 200405.
15340,2005-06,The second was the definite buildup of inflationary pressures as a result of a sharp rise in global petroleum prices.
15341,2005-06,The third was an unanticipated 13 per cent deficiency in the southwest monsoon.
15342,2005-06,"The fourth was an apparent decline in business confidence that had led to a sharp downturn in new investment, and also showed up as current account surpluses."
15343,2005-06,"By any standard, these were formidable challenges, but the UPA Government was prepared to face these challenges."
15344,2005-06,The Present: Where We Are in 200405 6.
15345,2005-06,"The National Common Minimum Programme NCMP mandated the Government to maintain a growth rate of 7  8 per cent a year, to promote investment, to generate employment, to accelerate fiscal consolidation, to ensure a higher fiscal devolution, and to focus on agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure."
15346,2005-06,The NCMP also mandated the Government to provide universal access to education and health care and to assure one hundred days of employment to one person in each family.
15347,2005-06,"I believe that, in the space of 9 months, we have risen to the challenge and carved out many successes."
15348,2005-06,"According to the Central Statistical Organization, the growth rate in the current year is estimated to be 6.9 per cent, with the manufacturing sector expected to grow at 8.9 per cent."
15349,2005-06,"As on February 12, 2005, the rate of inflation was 5.01 per cent which is more than one percentage point lower than what it was in the same week in the previous year."
15350,2005-06,"Inflation based on CPI for industrial workers was lower, and stood at 3.8 per cent in December, 2004."
15351,2005-06,Nonfood credit has increased by 21.2 per cent.
15352,2005-06,"As the year draws to a close, we can predict confidently that all the engines of the economy are running at nearly full speed."
15353,2005-06,We have also fulfilled many of our promises to the common citizen.
15354,2005-06,"Last year, I had promised that agricultural credit will be increased by 30 per cent, and I am happy to inform the House that, against the announced target of Rs 105,000 crore, we are likely to achieve a disbursement of Rs 108,500 crore."
15355,2005-06,Public sector banks and regional rural banks have added so far 58.20 lakh new farmers to their portfolio of borrowers.
15356,2005-06,I had promised that education loans would be given liberally to students.
15357,2005-06,"As against 1,08,000 loans amounting to 3 Rs 1,983 crore given in 200304, 1,40,000 loans amounting to Rs 2,249 crore have been given up to December 31, 2004."
15358,2005-06,"I had promised that the number of families covered under the Antyodaya Anna Yojana will be increased from 1.5 crore families to 2 crore families, and that promise has been kept."
15359,2005-06,I had promised that a redesigned Food for Work Programme will be launched in 150 districts.
15360,2005-06,"That was done on November 14, 2004."
15361,2005-06,I had promised that a National Rural Employment Guarantee Bill will be introduced.
15362,2005-06,I had promised that we would promote the concept of SelfHelp Groups vigorously.
15363,2005-06,"In the current year, against the target of 1.85 lakh SHGs, we have already credit linked 2.26 lakh SHGs, and we have disbursed credit to the tune of Rs 1,197 crore."
15364,2005-06,"Hon’ble Members will note that in each of these areas the focus of the Government’s attention has been the common citizen – be it farmer, student, selfemployed woman or labourer in search of work and food."
15365,2005-06,The Year Ahead: Where We Want To Be in 200506 8.
15366,2005-06,"Growth, stability and equity are mutually reinforcing objectives."
15367,2005-06,The NCMP leans towards decisive intervention by the State in favour of the poor.
15368,2005-06,"Given the resilience of the Indian economy, it is possible to mobilize the resources and launch a direct assault on poverty and unemployment."
15369,2005-06,That is the only way to bring immediate relief to the aam admi.
15370,2005-06,Let me first give the big picture.
15371,2005-06,"In 200405, Gross Budgetary Support GBS for the Plan was Rs 145,590 crore to which we added Rs 2,000 crore subsequently."
15372,2005-06,"As I shall explain later, the pattern of funding has changed consequent to the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission TFC."
15373,2005-06,"On a liketolike basis, GBS for the Plan in 200506, works out to Rs 172,500 crore."
15374,2005-06,This represents an increase of 16.9 per cent.
15375,2005-06,"Support for the Central Plan in BE 200405 was Rs 87,886 crore and in BE 200506 this has been enhanced to Rs 110,385 crore, representing a very substantial increase of 25.6 per cent."
15376,2005-06,"On priority sectors and flagship programmes falling under the NCMP, I propose to provide an additional sum of Rs 25,000 crore in the next year."
15377,2005-06,"For example, the allocation for education in 200506 will be Rs 18,337 crore."
15378,2005-06,"Next only to education, the plan allocation for rural development will be Rs 18,334 crore."
15379,2005-06,"On subsidy for fertilizers, the estimate is Rs 16,254 crore."
15380,2005-06,"The estimated expenditure on health and family welfare is Rs 10,280 crore."
15381,2005-06,ASSAULT ON POVERTY AND UNEMPLOYMENT Empowering the People 11.
15382,2005-06,"India is not a poor country, yet a significant proportion of our people are poor."
15383,2005-06,Poverty is not only income poverty.
15384,2005-06,"Other indicators of poverty are illiteracy, disease, infant mortality, malnutrition, absence of skills and unemployment."
15385,2005-06,"The whole purpose of democratic government is to eliminate poverty and give to every citizen the opportunity to be educated, to learn a skill and to be gainfully 4 employed."
15386,2005-06,The Government holds that it is its sacred duty to empower the poor and eliminate the scourge of poverty.
15387,2005-06,"In the last Budget, I had rejected the idea of jobless growth."
15388,2005-06,"As I unfold the vision of the UPA Government, Hon’ble Members will note that the central theme that runs through the various schemes and programmes is creation of jobs."
15389,2005-06,Assured irrigation facilities to an additional 1 crore hectares of land over a period of five years will generate employment for an additional 1 crore people at the rate 1 person per hectare.
15390,2005-06,The food processing industry is growing at a rate which generates 2.5 lakh jobs every year.
15391,2005-06,The textile sector alone has the potential to create 1.2 crore jobs over the next 5 years.
15392,2005-06,The information technology IT industry is expected to offer an additional 70 lakh jobs by 2009.
15393,2005-06,Construction industry is also expected to throw up lakhs of jobs.
15394,2005-06,Sectors with potential for generating employment will receive the highest attention of the Government.
15395,2005-06,National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme 13.
15396,2005-06,"After the National Food for Work programme was launched in November 2004, provision was made for the cash component and the foodgrain component."
15397,2005-06,"In overall terms, the expenditure in the current year is estimated at Rs 4,020 crore."
15398,2005-06,"For 200506, a provision of Rs 5,400 crore for the cash component and 50 lakh MT of foodgrains have been made and, in overall terms, the allocation will increase to Rs 11,000 crore."
15399,2005-06,It is Government’s intention to convert this programme into the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.
15400,2005-06,"When fully rolled out, the scheme will provide livelihood security for crores of poor families, and I promise to find the money for the programme."
15401,2005-06,National Rural Health Mission 14.
15402,2005-06,The National Rural Health Mission NRHM will be launched in the next fiscal.
15403,2005-06,Its focus will be strengthening primary health care through grass root level public health interventions based on community ownership.
15404,2005-06,"The total allocation for the Department of Health and the Department of Family Welfare will increase from Rs 8,420 crore in the current year to Rs 10,280 crore in the next year."
15405,2005-06,"The increase will finance the NRHM and its components like training of health volunteers, providing more medicines and strengthening the primary and community health centre system."
15406,2005-06,I am also happy to announce that work on the six AIIMSlike institutions will start next year to augment medical education in deficient States.
15407,2005-06,The Antyodaya Anna Yojana now covers 2 crore Below Poverty Line BPL families.
15408,2005-06,The number will be increased to 2.5 crore families in 200506.
15409,2005-06,The universalization of the Integrated Child Development Services ICDS scheme is overdue.
15410,2005-06,"It is my intention to ensure that, in every settlement, 5 there is a functional anganwadi that provides full coverage for all children."
15411,2005-06,"As on date there are 6,49,000 anganwadi centres."
15412,2005-06,"I propose to expand the ICDS scheme and create 1,88,168 additional centres that are required as per the existing population norms."
15413,2005-06,Forty seven per cent of children in the age group 03 are reportedly underweight.
15414,2005-06,Supplementary nutrition is an integral part of the ICDS scheme.
15415,2005-06,I propose to double the supplementary nutrition norms and share one half of the States’ costs for this purpose.
15416,2005-06,"I also propose to increase the allocation for ICDS from Rs 1,623 crore in BE 200405 to Rs 3,142 crore in BE 200506."
15417,2005-06,The Midday Meal Scheme for children has made a promising start throughout the country.

15419,2005-06,"The allocation in BE 200405 was Rs 1,675 crore."
15420,2005-06,"I propose to increase the allocation for the next year to Rs 3,010 crore."
15421,2005-06,The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan programme is the cornerstone of the Government’s intervention in basic education for all children.
15422,2005-06,"Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan was allocated Rs 3,057 crore in the Budget Estimates for 200405."
15423,2005-06,"During the course of the year, I enhanced the allocation to Rs 4,754 crore."
15424,2005-06,A nonlapsable fund called “Prarambhik Shiksha Kosh” has been created for funding this programme.

15429,2005-06,During 200506 the emphasis will be on covering more habitations.
15430,2005-06,"Emphasis will also be laid on tackling water quality in about 2.16 lakh habitations in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, West Bengal and some other States."
15431,2005-06,"I propose to increase the outlay for the Mission from Rs 3,300 crore in the current year to Rs 4,750 crore in the next year."
15432,2005-06,"Sanitation, however, remains critically deficient."
15433,2005-06,Only about 30 per cent of the rural households have access to safe sanitation facilities.
15434,2005-06,The Total Sanitation Campaign TSC now operates in 452 districts.
15435,2005-06,"Government intends to extend the TSC to all districts, and I propose to allocate Rs 630 crore for the next year."

15439,2005-06,"For the first time, you will find in the Budget papers a separate statement 6 on schemes for the development of SCs and STs."
15440,2005-06,"The allocation for the programmes is Rs 6,253 crore."
15441,2005-06,The key to empowering the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes is to provide top class education opportunities to meritorious students.
15442,2005-06,"The three on going scholarship schemes for SC/ST students under the Central Plan – pre Matric, postMatric, and meritbased – will continue."
15443,2005-06,"To provide an added incentive, I propose a new window: a short list of institutes of excellence will be notified, and any SC/ST student who secures admission in one of those institutes will be awarded a larger scholarship that will meet the requirements for tuition fees, living expenses, books and a computer."
15444,2005-06,The details of the scheme will be announced by the ministry concerned.
15445,2005-06,Government will also introduce the Rajiv Gandhi National Fellowship for SC and ST students for pursuing M. Phil and Ph.D. courses in selected universities.
15446,2005-06,I propose to provide funds for 2000 Fellowships per year to be awarded from 200506 on the pattern of UGC Fellowships.
15447,2005-06,"Last July, I promised to consider gender budgeting."
15448,2005-06,Hon’ble Members will be happy to note that I have included in the Budget documents a separate statement highlighting the gender sensitivities of the budgetary allocations under 10 demands for grants.
15449,2005-06,"The total amount in BE 200506, according to the statement, is Rs 14,379 crore."
15450,2005-06,"Although this is another first in budgetmaking in India, it is only a beginning and, in course of time, all Departments will be required to present gender budgets as well as make benefitincidence analyses."
15451,2005-06,Minorities would have to be brought more into the development process.
15452,2005-06,"I propose to increase the equity support, as may be required, for the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation."
15453,2005-06,A certain percentage of new schools that will be opened under the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan as well as the Kasturba Balika Vidyalaya Scheme will be located in districts or blocks having a substantial minority population.
15454,2005-06,"Likewise, a certain proportion of new anganwadi centres will be located in blocks or villages which have a substantial concentration of minorities."
15455,2005-06,"Urdu is the mother tongue of a large number of people in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, but there is very little provision for teaching Urdu."
15456,2005-06,I propose to provide central assistance for recruitment and posting of Urdu language teachers in primary and upperprimary schools that serve a population in which at least one fourth belong to that language group.
15457,2005-06,The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Human Resource Development implement a number of schemes for pre examination coaching of candidates belonging to the minority communities.
15458,2005-06,"These schemes are confined to Government institutions, and the results have not been encouraging."
15459,2005-06,"Hence, I propose to expand these schemes to include reputed private coaching institutes which have a track record of showing good results in competitive examinations."
15460,2005-06,I propose to provide funds to pay the fees on behalf of meritorious candidates from minority communities who enroll in these selected private institutes.
15461,2005-06,Backward Regions Grant Fund 30.
15462,2005-06,"Since the announcement in the last Budget of a Grant Fund for backward districts, a lot of thought has gone into the proposal."
15463,2005-06,An InterMinisterial Group IMG has identified 170 backward districts based on certain socioeconomic variables.
15464,2005-06,"The IMG has also proposed that resources under the new facility will be conditional on Panchayati Raj institutions being properly empowered, including devolution of functionaries and funds."
15465,2005-06,"I propose to accept the recommendations of the IMG, and I am happy to announce the establishment of a Backward Regions Grant Fund."
15466,2005-06,"An allocation of Rs 5,000 crore has been made in the Plan for 200506, and an equal amount will be allocated every year in the next four years."
15467,2005-06,"Consequent upon the establishment of the Fund, the existing Rashtriya Sam Vikas Yojana RSVY, envisaged to end in 200607, will be wound up with suitable transition arrangements that will protect every district now covered under RSVY."
15468,2005-06,"The NCMP refers to special economic packages for Bihar, Jammu & Kashmir and the North Eastern Region."
15469,2005-06,"Till now, Bihar received special assistance throughtheRSVY.ThetransitionarrangementsunderRSVYwillcontinueuntil 200607."
15470,2005-06,"Meanwhile, the backward districts of Bihar will begin to receive assistance from the Backward Regions Grant Fund."
15471,2005-06,"I may also point out that, recognizing the needs of Bihar, the TFC has made substantial grants amounting to Rs 7,975 crore for the period 200510."
15472,2005-06,Bihar has also been identified as one of the few States requiring special grants for the health and education sectors.

15476,2005-06,The Udhampur—Baramulla rail line will be implemented as a project of national importance.
15477,2005-06,All Ministries and Departments are required to allocate at least 10 per cent of their plan budget for schemes and programmes in the North Eastern Region NER.
15478,2005-06,"For 200506, this would amount to Rs 9,308 crore."
15479,2005-06,The Kumarghat—Agartala and Lumding—Silchar—Jiribam—Imphal projects will 8 be supported with additional funds outside the railway budget as projects of national importance.
15480,2005-06,"A special package for highway development in the NER has also been approved, and I have allocated Rs 450 crore in this behalf."
15481,2005-06,"Government will focus on providing basic infrastructure to the poor, especially those in rural India and in urban slums."
15482,2005-06,"The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund which was revived last July will, as in the current year, be provided a corpus of Rs 8,000 crore in 200506 also."
15483,2005-06,"In his address to Parliament, the President outlined an overarching vision to build India, and called it ‘Bharat Nirman’."
15484,2005-06,"Bharat Nirman has been conceived as a business plan, to be implemented over a period of four years, for building infrastructure, especially in rural India."
15485,2005-06,"It will have six components, namely, irrigation, roads, water supply, housing, rural electrification and rural telecom connectivity."
15486,2005-06,"In each of these areas, we must dare to be bold and set for ourselves high targets to be achieved by the year 2009."
15487,2005-06,"The UPA Government’s goals are: to bring an additional one crore hectares under assured irrigation; to connect all villages that have a population of 1000 or 500 in hilly/tribal areas with a road; to construct 60 lakh additional houses for the poor; to provide drinking water to the remaining 74,000 habitations that are uncovered; to reach electricity to the remaining 1,25,000 villages and offer electricity connection to 2.3 crore households; and to give telephone connectivity to the remaining 66,822 villages."
15488,2005-06,"Government believes that Bharat Nirman is an achievable project, and it is our intention to give rural India a new deal fully involving the Panchayati Raj Institutions in the planning and implementation."
15489,2005-06,I now turn to investment which is the paramount requirement to consolidate the growth process.
15490,2005-06,"In agriculture, we shall enhance public and private investment in the infrastructure required to support expansion, diversification and value addition."
15491,2005-06,"In the industrial sector, both the public sector and the private sector will be allowed the space to grow and compete with each other."
15492,2005-06,"Government will play the leading role in providing and facilitating investment in public goods such as roads, railways, power, seaports and airports."

15495,2005-06,"Success, however, will ultimately depend upon our ability to finance the growth."
15496,2005-06,"Government will, therefore, through a mix of right policies and prudent taxes, promote savings and devise ways and means to channel these savings into productive investment."
15497,2005-06,"The capital market, banks, insurance companies, pension funds and superannuation funds would have a crucial role in mobilizing and disbursing the financial resources required to sustain high investment."
15498,2005-06,"With about two thirds of the population dependent on agriculture, and the sector producing only 21 per cent of GDP in 200304, it is imperative that we address the problems of our farmers with a sense of urgency."
15499,2005-06,"Agriculture being a State subject, the bulk of public investment in agriculture takes place at the State level, and the Central Government’s support to States acts as a catalyst."
15500,2005-06,Roadmap for Agricultural Diversification 40.
15501,2005-06,"Indian agriculture has indeed diversified from food grains to other crops, but more needs to be done."

15503,2005-06,"The road map will focus on fruits, vegetables, flowers, dairy, poultry, fisheries, pulses and oilseeds."
15504,2005-06,"The National Horticulture Mission, announced in the last Budget, will be launched on April 1, 2005."
15505,2005-06,I propose to allocate Rs 630 crore in 200506 for the Mission.
15506,2005-06,"The Mission will ensure an endtoend approach having backward and forward linkages covering research, production, postharvest management, processing and marketing, under one umbrella, in an integrated manner."
15507,2005-06,"As the Mission gathers pace, more funds will be provided."
15508,2005-06,I am aware of the difficulties that the plantation sector has faced for some years now.
15509,2005-06,"While the prices of commodities such as tea and coffee have shown some improvement, the sector still faces difficulties."
15510,2005-06,The Price Stabilization Fund has not proved very effective or popular.
15511,2005-06,"Therefore, Government has set up an expert committee to suggest improvements to the Fund and its operation."
15512,2005-06,"In the case of tea, our comparative advantage has been eroded largely because of the declining productivity of tea."
15513,2005-06,Government will examine ways and means of introducing a programme for massive replantation and rejuvenation.
15514,2005-06,"Government proposes to introduce a new scheme called Development/ Strengthening of Agricultural Marketing Infrastructure, Grading and Standardization."
15515,2005-06,"The goal of this scheme is to induce large investments from the private and cooperative sectors for setting up agricultural markets, marketing infrastructure and support services such as grading, standardization and quality certification."
15516,2005-06,"Assistance will be available in the form of creditlinked, back ended subsidy."
15517,2005-06,It is proposed to implement the scheme through the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD and the National Cooperative Development Corporation NCDC in those States which amend their Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee APMC Acts.
15518,2005-06,I propose to allocate Rs 72 crore for the new scheme.
15519,2005-06,"Water Resources, Flood Management and Erosion Control 44."
15520,2005-06,"The National Project, announced by me last July, for the repair, renovation and restoration of water bodies will be launched in the month of March 2005."
15521,2005-06,"The pilot project is planned for 16 districts in 9 States and will cover nearly 700 water bodies, and 20,000 hectares of additional land will come under irrigation."
15522,2005-06,The allocation for the pilot project has been increased to Rs 100 crore in 200506.
15523,2005-06,"Uttar Pradesh, especially its eastern part, Bihar, West Bengal, Orissa, Assam and the North Eastern States are regularly affected by floods in the Ganga basin and in the Brahmaputra and Barak valleys."
15524,2005-06,A Task Force constituted to recommend measures for flood management and erosion control has submitted its report.
15525,2005-06,The Plan outlay in 200506 to implement the report will be Rs 180 crore.
15526,2005-06,"Besides, a sum of Rs 52 crore has been allocated for the Farakka Barrage Project."
15527,2005-06,The Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme AIBP has been reviewed and the focus turned to early completion of truly last mile projects.
15528,2005-06,"In BE 2004 05, I had provided a sum of Rs 2,800 crore."
15529,2005-06,"Having regard to the improvement in the pace of implementation, the outlay has been increased to Rs 4,800 crore for the next year."
15530,2005-06,Wateruse efficiency in Indian agriculture is one of the lowest in the world.
15531,2005-06,"Government will promote microirrigation technology, comprising drip and sprinkler irrigation, on a large scale."
15532,2005-06,"About 1.2 million hectares have been covered under microirrigation so far, and the plan is to increase the coverage to 3 million hectares by the end of the Tenth Plan and to 14 million hectares by the end of the Eleventh Plan."
15533,2005-06,"Accordingly, I have provided Rs 400 crore for promoting micro irrigation in 200506."
15534,2005-06,Rural Credit and Indebtedness 48.
15535,2005-06,"Government intends to continue with its effort to turn the focus of 11 commercial banks, regional rural banks RRBs and cooperative banks towards providing credit, especially production credit, to rural households and farm households."
15536,2005-06,"Particularly in agricultural credit, innovations are possible."
15537,2005-06,"I propose to request the Reserve Bank of India RBI to examine the issue of allowing banks to adopt the agency model, by using the infrastructure of civil society organizations, rural kiosks and village knowledge centres, to provide credit support to rural and farm sectors."
15538,2005-06,"In June 2004, I had announced my intention to double the flow of agricultural credit in three years."
15539,2005-06,"I had also announced an indicative target of Rs 105,000 crore."
15540,2005-06,"Notwithstanding a below par performance by cooperative banks, together, all three arms will disburse Rs 108,500 crore in the current year."
15541,2005-06,"Continuing on the same path, I propose to ask commercial banks, RRBs and cooperative banks to increase the flow of credit by another 30 per cent in 2005 06."
15542,2005-06,"Further, the public sector banks would be asked to increase the number of borrowers by another 50 lakh."
15543,2005-06,"Cooperative banks in India, with few exceptions, are in a shambles."
15544,2005-06,"Six State Central Cooperative Banks and 140 District Central Cooperative Banks do not comply with Section 11 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949."
15545,2005-06,They also have difficulty in accessing refinance for agricultural credit.
15546,2005-06,"Alarmed by the gravity of the situation, I had appointed a Task Force to examine the reforms required in the cooperative banking system."
15547,2005-06,The Task Force has submitted its report.
15548,2005-06,The recommendations include: Special financial assistance to wipe out accumulated losses and strengthen the capital base of cooperative credit institutions; Institutional restructuring to ensure democratic institutions; and Changes in the legal framework to empower RBI to enforce prudent financial management.
15549,2005-06,I propose to accept the report in principle.
15550,2005-06,I also propose to call State Governments for consultation and begin the process of implementing the recommendations in the States that show willingness to accept the recommendations.
15551,2005-06,The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme NAIS has been in operation since rabi 19992000.
15552,2005-06,I have received the recommendations made by the joint group constituted by the Ministry of Agriculture to suggest an improved farmer friendly crop insurance scheme.
15553,2005-06,Further consultation with all the stakeholders would be required.
15554,2005-06,"I, therefore, propose to continue the NAIS in its present form for kharif and rabi 200506."
15555,2005-06,The programme of linking Self Help Groups SHGs with the banking system has emerged as the major microfinance programme in the country.
15556,2005-06,I propose to enhance the target for creditlinking in the next fiscal from 2 lakh SHGs to 2.5 lakh SHGs.
15557,2005-06,"At present, micro finance institutions MFIs obtain finance from banks according to guidelines issued by RBI."
15558,2005-06,MFIs seek to provide small scale credit and other financial services to low income households and small informal businesses.
15559,2005-06,Government intends to promote MFIs in a big way.
15560,2005-06,"The way forward, I believe, is to identify MFIs, classify and rate such institutions, and empower them to intermediate between the lending banks and the beneficiaries."
15561,2005-06,Commercial banks may appoint MFIs as “banking correspondents” to provide transaction services on their behalf.
15562,2005-06,"Since MFIs require infusion of new capital, I propose to redesignate the existing Rs 100 crore Micro Finance Development Fund as the “Micro Finance Development and Equity Fund”, and increase the corpus to Rs 200 crore."
15563,2005-06,"The fund will be managed by a Board consisting of representatives of NABARD, commercial banks and professionals with domain knowledge."
15564,2005-06,"The Board will be asked to suggest suitable legislation, and I expect to introduce a draft Bill in the next fiscal year."
15565,2005-06,I propose to request RBI to open a window to enable qualified NGOs engaged in microfinance activities to use the External Commercial Borrowing ECB window.
15566,2005-06,Detailed guidelines containing necessary safeguards will be issued by RBI.
15567,2005-06,"The benefits of opening the insurance sector are now visible by way of vast improvement in insurance penetration and insurance density, and the availability of a wide variety of products."
15568,2005-06,Government would like to see these benefits percolate to rural India and to the vulnerable sections of the population.
15569,2005-06,Micro insurance is a distinct product.
15570,2005-06,Its design and delivery are specialized functions.
15571,2005-06,The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority IRDA has published draft Regulations for micro insurance.
15572,2005-06,"NGOs, SHGs, cooperatives and MFIs will be invited to become micro insurance agents."
15573,2005-06,Government will extend full support to the effort of IRDA to promote micro insurance.

15575,2005-06,The National Commission on Farmers has recommended the establishment of Rural Knowledge Centres all over the country using modern information and communication technology ICT.

15577,2005-06,Their goal is to set up a Knowledge Centre in every village by the 60th anniversary of Independence Day.
15578,2005-06,"Government supports the goal, and I am glad to announce that Government has decided to join the alliance and route its support through NABARD."
15579,2005-06,I propose to allow NABARD to provide Rs 100 crore out of RIDF.
15580,2005-06,Agricultural Research has a vital role to play in the strategy for reviving and encouraging diversification.
15581,2005-06,Our agricultural universities and research institutions have done good work in the past and now need to be strengthened and modernized.
15582,2005-06,A Task Force headed by Dr. M S Swaminathan has recommended the creation of a National Fund for Strategic Agricultural Research.
15583,2005-06,I am happy to announce an initial provision of Rs 50 crore for operationalizing this Fund.
15584,2005-06,India should build on its manufacturing capacities and scale them up to global standards.
15585,2005-06,Both the Investment Commission and the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council have started work in right earnest.
15586,2005-06,I believe we shall reap the first successes of their work in the next financial year.
15587,2005-06,"Worldwide, it is manufacturing that has driven growth."
15588,2005-06,"In order to revive the manufacturing sector, particularly small and medium enterprises, and to enable them to adjust to the competitive pressures caused by liberalization and moderation of tariff rates, I propose to launch a new scheme that will help them strengthen their operations and sharpen their competitiveness."
15589,2005-06,The scheme will be called the “Manufacturing Competitiveness Programme.”
15590,2005-06,The design of the scheme will be worked out by the National Manufacturing Competitiveness Council in consultation with the industry.
15591,2005-06,"In the last Budget, I made a beginning in addressing the taxinduced rigidities in the textile sector in order to prepare the sector for the postquota regime."
15592,2005-06,"There is a new vigour in the sector, especially in the handloom and powerloom segments."
15593,2005-06,Government will continue to nurture the textile sector which has huge potential for employment and exports.
15594,2005-06,"The estimate of investment made in 200405 is Rs 20,000 crore."
15595,2005-06,"The estimate for the next year is Rs 30,000 crore."
15596,2005-06,The Technology Upgradation Fund TUF scheme is being continued with an enhanced allocation of Rs 435 crore.
15597,2005-06,I propose to introduce a 10 per cent capital subsidy scheme for the textile processing sector in addition to the normal benefits available under the TUF Scheme.
15598,2005-06,I think it is necessary to lend further help to the handloom sector.
15599,2005-06,The Government proposes to adopt the cluster development approach for the production and marketing of handloom products.
15600,2005-06,"The Ministry of Textiles will take up 20 clusters in the first phase at a cost of Rs 40 crore, and the amount will be provided during the course of the year."
15601,2005-06,"The Government is implementing a life insurance scheme for handloom weavers which provides insurance cover up to Rs 50,000."
15602,2005-06,"At present, only 2 lakh weavers are covered."
15603,2005-06,I propose to enlarge the coverage of the scheme to 20 14 lakh weavers in two years which will cost Rs 30 crore per year when fully rolled out.
15604,2005-06,The Government is also implementing a health insurance package for weavers.
15605,2005-06,"Here too, the coverage is now only for 25,000 weavers."
15606,2005-06,I propose to increase the coverage to 2 lakh weavers at a recurring cost of Rs 30 crore per year.
15607,2005-06,"Once the two new and enlarged schemes are approved, I propose to provide the required funds."
15608,2005-06,The sugar industry has been under financial stress since 2001.
15609,2005-06,The position became worse due to two successive droughts in certain parts of the country.
15610,2005-06,The Tuteja Committee appointed by the Government has submitted its report.
15611,2005-06,"After a careful examination of the report, and after consulting RBI and NABARD, I propose the following financial package for the revitalization of the sugar industry: Sugar factories that were operational in 200203 sugar season will be assisted to restructure."
15612,2005-06,"NABARD, in consultation with State Governments, RBI, banks and financial institutions will work out a scheme for providing a financial package with a moratorium of two years, on both principal and interest, and a schedule of payment having regard to the commercial viability of each unit."
15613,2005-06,Government has already reduced the rate of interest on loans from the Sugar Development Fund to 2 percentage points below the bank rate.
15614,2005-06,"I propose to make the same rate applicable to outstanding loans as on October 21, 2004."
15615,2005-06,Indian Banks’ Association IBA and NABARD will be asked to work out a scheme under which individual sugar factories may renegotiate the rate of interest on their past high interest loans.
15616,2005-06,Our human resource base gives us an exceptional advantage in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.

15618,2005-06,Government has already set up a Rs 150 crore research and development corpus fund for the industry.
15619,2005-06,"The corpus deserves to be increased, and I propose to do so in phases beginning next year."
15620,2005-06,"India has also the potential to become an attractive destination for outsourcing in drug discovery and clinical research, and for codevelopment of drugs and manufacturing."
15621,2005-06,"In biotechnology, the industry has the potential to be a global leader supplying novel technologies and products to the health and agriculture sectors."
15622,2005-06,Government will provide a stable policy environment and necessary incentives to help the two industries become world leaders.
15623,2005-06,Small and Medium Enterprises 65.
15624,2005-06,"In recent years, our approach to small scale industry has evolved, and 15 now we are inclined to treat the sector as the small and medium enterprises sector."
15625,2005-06,"Continuing the process initiated a few years ago, after consulting stakeholders and on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the Ministry of Small Scale Industries has identified 108 items for dereservation."
15626,2005-06,"Among them, I would like to mention 30 items in the category of “textile products, including hosiery”, which is a sector poised for rapid growth."
15627,2005-06,"In the last Budget, I had significantly liberalized the capital subsidy scheme, and a provision of Rs 135 crore was made for “Promotion of SSI Schemes”."
15628,2005-06,That provision is being enhanced to Rs 173 crore in 200506.
15629,2005-06,Small Industries Development Bank of India SIDBI has established this year a SME Growth Fund with a corpus of Rs 500 crore.
15630,2005-06,"Small and medium units in knowledgebased industries such as pharma, biotech, and IT will be provided equity support through this fund."
15631,2005-06,There is a need for new legislation that will provide a supportive environment for small and medium enterprises.
15632,2005-06,"I am glad to inform the House that my colleague, the Minister of Small Scale Industries, will introduce in this session the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Bill."
15633,2005-06,"Skills development, especially for youth who have only minimal formal education, is an area which can no longer be ignored."
15634,2005-06,"Last July, I had proposed a programme to upgrade 500 Industrial Training Institutes ITIs."
15635,2005-06,I am happy to inform the House that in the current year 100 ITIs have been identified.
15636,2005-06,"Out of them, 67 ITIs in 15 States/Union Territories have been linked with industry and will be upgraded at a cost of Rs 1.6 crore each."
15637,2005-06,There is a demand for specific skills of a high order which is often unmet.
15638,2005-06,"I, therefore, propose a PublicPrivate Partnership between Government and industry that will take up the skills development programme under the name Skills Development Initiative or SDI."
15639,2005-06,Details of the scheme will be worked out and announced shortly.
15640,2005-06,We shall build on the growing external strengths of the economy.
15641,2005-06,Government has delivered on the promise to accelerate foreign trade.
15642,2005-06,"In April January 200405 exports and imports have grown by 25.55 per cent and 34.72 per cent, respectively, in US dollar terms."
15643,2005-06,Government has fixed an ambitious target of US$ 150 billion for exports by the year 200809 in order to double India’s share in world exports to 1.5 per cent.
15644,2005-06,We intend to further liberalize trade policy and extend full support to the efforts of our exporters.
15645,2005-06,"On foreign direct investment FDI, I would urge Hon’ble Members to take a pragmatic view."
15646,2005-06,"At the recent meeting of the Finance Ministers of G7 16 countries, to which India and China were invited, the Finance Minister of China looked in my direction and told the gathering that China had received US$ 500 billion worth of foreign investment since China opened its economy in 1980."
15647,2005-06,"Of this, nearly US$ 60 billion came in calendar 2004."
15648,2005-06,"Our own experience has been that the automobile, software, telecommunication and electronics sectors have benefited from FDI and have assimilated themselves into the global production chain."
15649,2005-06,"I believe that there are opportunities in other sectors as well, such as mining, trade and pensions."
15650,2005-06,"Government will, after due consultation, come forward with suitable proposals."
15651,2005-06,Telecommunication is the best way to provide connectivity in urban and rural India.
15652,2005-06,"By the end of January 2005, we had achieved a teledensity of 8.75 per cent."
15653,2005-06,"However, we are concerned with the low teledensity in rural areas."
15654,2005-06,"So far, Government has released Rs 1,700 crore to the Universal Service Obligation USO Fund, which has been fully utilized."
15655,2005-06,"A provision of Rs 1,200 crore has been made for 200506."
15656,2005-06,"The National Highway Development Programme NHDP has made steady progress, and 5,172 kms of National Highways have been fourlaned till January 2005 under NHDP I and NHDP II."
15657,2005-06,"To be launched in the next fiscal, NHDP III will target selected high density highways not forming part of the Golden Quadrilateral or the NorthSouth and EastWest corridors."
15658,2005-06,"I have provided Rs 1,400 crore for this purpose in 200506 to fourlane 4000 kms."
15659,2005-06,"A special package for the North Eastern region has also been approved, and I have allocated Rs 450 crore in this behalf."
15660,2005-06,"In overall terms, the outlay for National Highway development will be increased from Rs 6,514 crore in BE 200405 to Rs 9,320 crore in 200506."
15661,2005-06,A massive programme for rural electrification will begin in 200506 with the objective of covering 1.25 lakh villages in five years.
15662,2005-06,The focus will be on deficient States.
15663,2005-06,"The programme envisages creation of a rural electricity distribution backbone, with a 33/11 KV substation in each block and at least one distribution transformer in each village."
15664,2005-06,"I have provided Rs 1,100 crore for this programme in the next year."

15667,2005-06,About 15 lakh houses will be constructed during the next year.
15668,2005-06,The importance of infrastructure for rapid economic development cannot be overstated.
15669,2005-06,The most glaring deficit in India is the infrastructure deficit.
15670,2005-06,Investment in infrastructure will continue to be funded through the Budget.
15671,2005-06,"However, there are many infrastructure projects that are financially viable but, in the current situation, face difficulties in raising resources."
15672,2005-06,I propose that such projects may be funded through a financial Special Purpose Vehicle SPV.
15673,2005-06,"When large infrastructure projects are implemented, the foreign exchange resources could be drawn for financing necessary imports."
15674,2005-06,"Accordingly, I propose to establish an SPV to finance infrastructure projects in specified sectors."
15675,2005-06,"Roads, ports, airports and tourism would be sectors that can benefit most from the SPV."
15676,2005-06,The projects will be appraised by an InterInstitutional Group of banks and financial institutions.
15677,2005-06,"The SPV will lend funds, especially debt of longer term maturity, directly to the eligible projects to supplement other loans from banks and financial institutions Government will communicate the borrowing limit to the SPV at the beginning of each fiscal year."
15678,2005-06,"For 200506, I propose to fix the borrowing limit at Rs 10,000 crore."
15679,2005-06,I have also made a provision of Rs 1500 crore for “viability gap” funding for infrastructure projects.
15680,2005-06,That mechanism will be used also in conjunction with the funding mechanism through the SPV.
15681,2005-06,The unorganized or informal sector accounts for 92 per cent of the employment and absorbs the bulk of the annual accretion to the labour force.
15682,2005-06,"PURA or Provision of Urban Amenities in Rural Areas is an idea that contains within itself possible solutions to a number of problems that afflict rural India such as unemployment, isolation from markets, lack of connectivity and migration to cities."
15683,2005-06,The National Commission on Enterprises in the Unorganized/ Informal Sector has proposed pilot projects for ‘growth poles’ applying the PURA principles.
15684,2005-06,The objectives are to expand production and employment in the unorganized enterprises around existing clusters of industrial activities and services as well as encourage the formation of new clusters.
15685,2005-06,"Once the proposals are firmed up, Government will take up the creation of a few growth poles, as pilot projects, in 200506."
15686,2005-06,National Urban Renewal Mission 79.
15687,2005-06,The demographic trends in the country indicate a rapid increase in urbanization.
15688,2005-06,India needs urban facilities of satisfactory standards to cope with the challenge.
15689,2005-06,"If our cities are not renewed, they will die."
15690,2005-06,The National Urban Renewal Mission is designed to meet this challenge.
15691,2005-06,"It will cover the seven mega cities, all cities with a population of over a million, and some other towns."
15692,2005-06,"The Mumbai Metro Rail Project, the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, the Mumbai Western Expressway Sealink and the Bangalore Metro Rail Project are examples of projects which could be supported through the Mission."
15693,2005-06,"The incipient investment boom in infrastructure, industry including housing, and services needs to be nurtured through further reforms in the financial sector including reforms in bank finance and debt and equity markets."
15694,2005-06,The banking sector presents a picture of paradoxes.
15695,2005-06,There are many banks in India but none among the top twenty in the world.
15696,2005-06,"Our largest bank, the State Bank of India, ranks 82 in terms of business."
15697,2005-06,"It is universally acknowledged that the key drivers of the banking sector in the future will be Competition, Consolidation and Convergence."
15698,2005-06,RBI has prepared a road map for banking sector reforms and will unveil the same.
15699,2005-06,"While most proposals will be implemented by the RBI on its own authority, some legislative changes would be required to be made."
15700,2005-06,"I had promised that a comprehensive Bill to amend the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 will be introduced in the Budget Session."
15701,2005-06,"In consultation with the RBI, I propose to introduce amendments to the Act – to remove the lower and upper bounds to the statutory liquidity ratio SLR and provide flexibility to RBI to prescribe prudential norms; to allow banking companies to issue preference shares, since preference share capital can be treated as regulatory capital under specified circumstances as per Basel norms; to introduce specific provisions to enable the consolidated supervision of banks and their subsidiaries by RBI in consonance with the international best practices in this regard; I also propose to introduce amendments to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to remove the limits of the cash reserve ratio CRR to facilitate more flexible conduct of monetary policy; and to enable RBI to lend or borrow securities by way of repo, reverse repo or otherwise."
15702,2005-06,"With increasing longevity, the problem of oldage income security can no longer be ignored."
15703,2005-06,Government had announced a defined contribution pension scheme for newly recruited Central Government employees which would also be extended to the unorganized sector.
15704,2005-06,"I am happy to inform the House that 19 seven State Governments – Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Manipur, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu – have introduced similar schemes for their employees."
15705,2005-06,Other States have also evinced interest.
15706,2005-06,"An Ordinance was promulgated on December 29, 2004 to set up a Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority PFRDA."
15707,2005-06,I propose to introduce a Bill to replace the Ordinance during this session.
15708,2005-06,"Through the new scheme, it is proposed to offer a menu of investment choices to the subscriber and to provide a strong regulatory mechanism to ensure that the interests of subscribers are protected."
15709,2005-06,I appeal to workers all over the country to join the new pension system.
15710,2005-06,The capital market has emerged as a major vehicle for converting savings into investment.
15711,2005-06,It is also the preferred investment destination of foreign savings.
15712,2005-06,"The steps announced by me last July, and implemented, have strengthened the capital market."
15713,2005-06,"It is time for more measures and, hence, I propose to – authorize Securities and Exchange Board of India SEBI to set up a National Institute of Securities Markets for teaching and training intermediaries in the securities markets and promoting research; and permit FIIs to submit appropriate collateral, in cash or otherwise, as prescribed by SEBI, when trading in derivatives on the domestic market."
15714,2005-06,"While India’s equity market has made progress, the corporate bond market still lags behind."
15715,2005-06,"In order to address this gap, I propose to — amend the definition of ‘securities’ under the Securities Contracts Regulation Act, 1956 so as to provide a legal framework for trading of securitized debt including mortgage backed debt; and appoint a high level Expert Committee on corporate bonds and securitization to look into the legal, regulatory, tax and market design issues in the development of the corporate bond market."
15716,2005-06,Over the Counter OTC Derivatives 87.
15717,2005-06,"Over the counter OTC derivatives play a crucial role in mitigating the risks of corporates, banks and other financial entities."
15718,2005-06,"There is, however, some ambiguity regarding the legality of OTC derivative contracts which has inhibited their growth."
15719,2005-06,"I, therefore, propose to take measures to provide for clear legal validity of such contracts."
15720,2005-06,Stamp duty on Stock Exchange Corporatization 88.
15721,2005-06,"The Securities Contracts Regulation Act, 1956, as amended recently, requires all stock exchanges to be corporatized and demutualized."
15722,2005-06,Three stock exchanges are not yet corporatized.
15723,2005-06,"In order to facilitate their corporatization, I propose to grant a onetime exemption to them from stamp duty on the notional transfer of assets."
15724,2005-06,"In order to create a level playing field for banks and nonbank entities to issue commercial paper, and to bring the Indian commercial paper market closer to international standard, I propose to rationalize the stamp duty so that it applies uniformly regardless of the issuing entity."
15725,2005-06,Mumbai – A Regional Financial Centre 90.
15726,2005-06,"When I look at the map of the world, I am struck by the strategic location of Mumbai."
15727,2005-06,"It lies almost midway between London and Tokyo, two nerve centres of world finance."
15728,2005-06,Mumbai is also home to the National Stock Exchange NSE and the Bombay Stock Exchange BSE which now rank no.3 and no.5 among the stock exchanges of the world by the number of trades per year.
15729,2005-06,"In the last decade, we have built world class institutions on the securities markets and we now compare with the best in terms of technological sophistication, risk management and sound governance."
15730,2005-06,I believe the time has come to begin work on making Mumbai a regional hub for finance.
15731,2005-06,"In consultation with the RBI, I propose to appoint a high powered Expert Committee to advise the Government on how to make Mumbai a regional financial centre."
15732,2005-06,Ten years ago we embarked on the process of ensuring that gold inflows are through the official channels alone.
15733,2005-06,I believe that we are now in a position to introduce ‘gold units’ and create a market for such units.
15734,2005-06,"I propose to ask SEBI to permit, in consultation with RBI, mutual funds to introduce Gold Exchange Traded Funds GETFs with gold as the underlying asset, in order to enable any household to buy and sell gold in units for as little as Rs 100."
15735,2005-06,Such units could be traded in the same manner as units of mutual funds.
15736,2005-06,OTHER PROPOSALS Institutions of Excellence 92.
15737,2005-06,"On January 6, 2005, the Prime Minister spoke about his intention to set up a Knowledge Commission to look into the issue of building quality human capital."
15738,2005-06,Government believes that investments in institutions of higher education and Research and Development organizations are as important as investments in physical capital and physical infrastructure.
15739,2005-06,"What we need are world class universities, and we must make a beginning with one institution."
15740,2005-06,We must have a university that will be ranked alongside Oxford and Cambridge or Harvard and Stanford.
15741,2005-06,"I am happy to inform the House that we have selected the Indian Institute of Science IISc, Bangalore, which enjoys a high reputation as a centre of excellence in research and development."
15742,2005-06,"We shall work to make IISc, in a few years, a world class university."
15743,2005-06,I propose to provide an additional sum of Rs 100 crore as a grant for this purpose.
15744,2005-06,Stamp Duty on Commercial Paper VAT 21 93.
15745,2005-06,"In a remarkable display of the spirit of cooperative federalism, the States are poised to undertake the most important tax reform ever attempted in this country."
15746,2005-06,"All States have agreed to introduce the value added tax VAT with effect from April 1, 2005."
15747,2005-06,"VAT is a modern, simple and transparent tax system that will replace the existing sales tax and eliminate the cascading effect of sales tax."
15748,2005-06,It is in force in more than 130 countries ranging from Sri Lanka to China.
15749,2005-06,"India too has a VAT at the Central level CENVAT, but only for goods."
15750,2005-06,"In the medium to long term, it is my goal that the entire production– distribution chain should be covered by a national VAT, or even better, a goods and services tax, encompassing both the Centre and the States."
15751,2005-06,"The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers, with the solid support of the Chief Ministers, has laboured through the last 7 years to arrive at a framework acceptable to all States."
15752,2005-06,"The Central Government has promised its full support and has also agreed to compensate the States, according to an agreed formula, in the event of any revenue loss."
15753,2005-06,"I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the Empowered Committee, and wish the States success on the introduction and implementation of VAT."
15754,2005-06,"On February 26, 2005 I laid before Parliament the recommendations made by the Twelfth Finance Commission TFC."
15755,2005-06,"TFC’s recommendations cover tax devolution, grants to States, debt relief, financing of relief expenditure and related matters."
15756,2005-06,States stand to gain considerably by the award.
15757,2005-06,"However, the implementation of the TFC recommendations will put a large burden on Central finances through the period 200510, and especially in the first year, 200506, when the change to the new pattern will take place."
15758,2005-06,"Consolidation and rescheduling of Central loans, reduction in the interest rate and specific grants under different heads will affect both capital and revenue receipts of the Central Government."
15759,2005-06,"The total impact on the Central budget for 200506 will be approximately Rs 26,000 crore or an addition of threequarters of a percentage point as a proportion of GDP."
15760,2005-06,"Needless to say, this will have an impact on Government’s capacity to abide by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act FRBM in 200506."
15761,2005-06,"Last July, in order to catch up with the backlog of expenditure that had not been provided for, I had increased the allocation for Defence to Rs 77,000 crore."
15762,2005-06,"I am happy to inform the House that, after a gap, defence expenditure in 200405 has matched the Budget Estimates."
15763,2005-06,"I propose to increase the allocation for Defence in 200506 to Rs 83,000 crore, which will include an allocation of Rs 34,375 crore for capital expenditure."
15764,2005-06,The current phase of high growth provides us an opportunity that should not be frittered away.
15765,2005-06,We must use this opportunity to improve the fiscal health of the country.
15766,2005-06,"We must increase our revenues and reorient expenditure to pay for more outlays on education, health and infrastructure."
15767,2005-06,"At the same time, I must caution that outlays do not necessarily mean outcomes."
15768,2005-06,The people of the country are concerned with outcomes.
15769,2005-06,The Prime Minister has repeatedly emphasized the need to improve the quality of implementation and enhance the efficiency and accountability of the delivery mechanism.
15770,2005-06,"During the course of the year, together with the Planning Commission, we shall put in place a mechanism to measure the development outcomes of all major programmes."
15771,2005-06,We shall also ensure that programmes and schemes are not allowed to continue indefinitely from one Plan period to the next without an independent and indepth evaluation.
15772,2005-06,Civil society should also engage Government in a healthy debate on the efficiency of the delivery mechanism.
15773,2005-06,"Following my announcement last July, I placed before Parliament a report on Central Government subsidies."
15774,2005-06,There are three main products that involve large explicit subsidies from the Budget and otherwise.
15775,2005-06,"These are food, fertilizer and petroleum."
15776,2005-06,Subsidies provide a measure of protection for the poor and we shall continue to provide subsidies.
15777,2005-06,"However, we must now take up the task of restructuring the subsidy regime in a cautious manner and after a thorough discussion."
15778,2005-06,"The Ministry of Agriculture intends to make procurement of food grains more cost effective through decentralized procurement, especially in the non traditional States, without impairing the present MSPbased procurement."
15779,2005-06,"A Working Group constituted by the Department of Fertilizers is now examining several issues for implementing the next stage of the New Pricing Scheme for fertilizers commencing from April 1, 2006."
15780,2005-06,"The fertilizer subsidy bill could be pruned if naphtha and FO/LSHS, now used as feedstock, are replaced by natural gas."
15781,2005-06,"As far as petroleum products are concerned, the Government has received the recommendations of the Lahiri Committee, and appropriate decisions have been taken, to which I shall refer in Part B of my speech."
15782,2005-06,"What gives me satisfaction is that, while faithfully attempting to implement the mandate of the NCMP, I have been able to remain on the path of fiscal consolidation."
15783,2005-06,"According to the revised estimates for 200304, the revenue deficit was 3.6 percent and the fiscal deficit was 4.8 per cent of GDP."
15784,2005-06,"The FRBM Act requires a reduction in the two ratios, respectively, of 0.5 per cent and 0.3 per cent every year."
15785,2005-06,"I am happy to inform the House that we will achieve 23 this degree of fiscal correction in 200405, and the year is expected to end with a revenue deficit of 2.7 per cent and a fiscal deficit of 4.5 per cent of GDP."
15786,2005-06,Now I turn to the Budget Estimates for the next fiscal.
15787,2005-06,"Plan expenditure for 200506 is estimated, on a liketolike basis, at Rs 172,500 crore."
15788,2005-06,"However, the Budget shows Plan expenditure at Rs 143,497 crore, and the balance amount of Rs 29,003 crore will be raised as loans by the State Governments directly, in accordance with the recommendations of the TFC."
15789,2005-06,"NonPlan expenditure in 200506 is estimated to be Rs 370,847 crore, the increase being mainly due to enhanced grants to the States as recommended by TFC."
15790,2005-06,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit 107.
15791,2005-06,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 200506, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 514,344 crore."
15792,2005-06,"I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs 351,200 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs 446,512 crore."
15793,2005-06,"Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs 95,312 crore which is equal to 2.7 per cent of the estimated GDP."
15794,2005-06,"The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 151,144 crore, which is 4.3 per cent of the estimated GDP."
15795,2005-06,"Consequent to accepting the recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission and the drastically changed pattern of devolution and funding, there has been a considerable strain in making the Budget for 200506."
15796,2005-06,I was left with no option but to press the ‘pause’ button visavis the FRBM Act.
15797,2005-06,I am relieved that we have not been forced to go in the opposite direction.
15798,2005-06,I may add that we are perilously close to the limits of fiscal prudence and there is no more room for spending beyond our means.
15799,2005-06,I am confident that we can resume the process of fiscal correction with effect from 200607 and achieve the FRBM goals by 200809.
15800,2005-06,"TAX PROPOSALS 24 PART – B Mr. Speaker, Sir, I shall now present my tax proposals."
15801,2005-06,"I had articulated the UPA Government’s principles and our approach to taxation in my Budget speech in July 2004, and, hence, there is no need to repeat them."
15802,2005-06,"While adhering to those principles, it is Government’s intention, as announced by the Prime Minister, to undertake major tax reforms to improve the tax to GDP ratio, expand the tax payer base, increase tax compliance and make tax administration more efficient."
15803,2005-06,Indirect Taxes I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes.
15804,2005-06,I intend to advance the Government’s declared policy of making the customs duty structure closer to that of our East Asian neighbours.
15805,2005-06,"Therefore, I propose to reduce the peak rate for nonagricultural products from 20 per cent to 15 per cent."
15806,2005-06,"Consistent with the peak duty rate, I propose to bring down the customs duty rates on capital goods and raw materials as well as correct any inverted duty structures."
15807,2005-06,"In order to promote investment, I propose to reduce the customs duties on selected capital goods and parts thereof to below 15 per cent, to 10 per cent in some cases and to 5 per cent in some others."
15808,2005-06,"For most textile machinery, I propose to reduce the duty from 20 per cent to 10 per cent, in order to help the textile industry acquire a competitive edge in the postquota regime."
15809,2005-06,"Similarly, to encourage the food processing industry, I propose to reduce the duty on refrigerated vans from 20 per cent to 10 per cent."
15810,2005-06,"To give a legup to the leather and footwear industry, I propose to reduce the customs duties on seven specified machinery from 20 per cent to 5 per cent."
15811,2005-06,"The duty on ethyl vinyl acetate EVA, an input for the footwear industry, is also proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 10 per cent."
15812,2005-06,Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology are sunrise sectors.
15813,2005-06,I propose to reduce the customs duty on nine specified machinery used in these two sectors to 5 per cent.
15814,2005-06,I also propose to reduce the customs duties on specified parts of battery operated road vehicles and for printing presses from 20 per cent to 10 per cent.
15815,2005-06,"For primary and secondary metals, I propose to reduce the customs duties from 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
15816,2005-06,"Similarly, industrial raw materials such as catalysts, refractory raw materials, basic plastic materials, molasses and industrial 25 ethyl alcohol, which are key inputs to manufacture, will now be liable to a reduced customs duty rate of 10 per cent."
15817,2005-06,"On lead, I propose to reduce the duty to 5 per cent."
15818,2005-06,Coking coal with high ash content attracts a duty of 15 per cent.
15819,2005-06,I propose to bring the rate down to 5 per cent.
15820,2005-06,"Keeping in mind the crucial need to encourage the textile sector, the customs duty rates on polyester and nylon chips, textile fibres, yarns and intermediates, fabrics, and garments are proposed to be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per cent."
15821,2005-06,The electronics and telecom sectors merit special attention.
15822,2005-06,"On 217 Information Technology Agreement ITA bound items, the duty is required to be brought down to nil."
15823,2005-06,"Consequently, to provide a levelplaying field to the domestic industry, I propose to remove the customs duty on specified capital goods and all inputs required for the manufacture of ITA bound items."
15824,2005-06,"However, I intend to take the power to impose a countervailing duty CVD of 4 per cent on all imports to compensate for the State level taxes, in particular the forthcoming State level VAT that is proposed to be imposed on corresponding domestic goods."
15825,2005-06,"For the present, I propose to levy a CVD of 4 per cent only on the imports of ITA bound items and their inputs that attract nil duty."
15826,2005-06,Credit for the CVD will be available against payment of excise duty.
15827,2005-06,"However, because we have a soft corner for these wares, IT software will be exempt from the proposed CVD."
15828,2005-06,I do not propose to make any changes in the customs duties applicable to agricultural goods.
15829,2005-06,"In fact, I have decided to increase the duty on cut flowers from 30 per cent to 60 per cent."
15830,2005-06,"However, at the request of the trade, and since there is little domestic production, I propose to reduce the duty rate on cloves to 35 per cent."
15831,2005-06,"In order to encourage the import of technology to produce pure drinking water, I propose to reduce the import duty on atmospheric drinking water generators from 20 per cent to 5 per cent."
15832,2005-06,I have some proposals on the Excise side too.
15833,2005-06,Government’s intention is to bring as many goods as possible to the CENVAT rate of 16 per cent.
15834,2005-06,"Today, 5 items attract 24 per cent."
15835,2005-06,"Out of the 5, I have picked out three — polyester filament yarn, tyres and air conditioners — and I propose to reduce the excise duty on these goods to 16 per cent."
15836,2005-06,"Manufacturers of motor cars and aerated drinks, the other two items, would have to wait for some more time."
15837,2005-06,"Last year, I took a big step forward to prepare the textile industry to meet the challenges of the postquota regime."
15838,2005-06,I reaffirm that the CENVAT exemption route for natural fibres will remain in force.
15839,2005-06,I now propose to give independent texturizers the option to avail of the exemption route or pay 8 per cent excise duty with CENVAT credit.
15840,2005-06,Imitation jewellery now attracts an excise duty of 16 per cent.
15841,2005-06,"Since they are products predominantly consumed by the less affluent sections, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 8 per cent."
15842,2005-06,"At the same time, expensive and premium jewellery is now manufactured and sold under alluring brand names."
15843,2005-06,"On such branded jewellery, I propose to levy an excise duty of 2 per cent."
15844,2005-06,"I may clarify that there is no levy on unbranded jewellery, including unbranded gold jewellery."
15845,2005-06,"In order to remove certain distortions in the tax treatment of comparable products, I propose to levy an excise duty on mosaic tiles at 8 per cent and on road tractors for semitrailers of engine capacity exceeding 1800 cc at 16 per cent."
15846,2005-06,I may clarify that agricultural tractors will continue to remain exempt.
15847,2005-06,"Some sectors deserve relief, since they produce goods for the common citizen."
15848,2005-06,"Today, there is a surcharge of Re.1 per kg on tea."
15849,2005-06,I propose to abolish the surcharge.
15850,2005-06,There is also an excise duty of Re.1 per kg on refined edible oils and Rs 1.25 per kg on vanaspati.
15851,2005-06,I propose to abolish both levies and fully exempt the two items.
15852,2005-06,"Even while protecting the handmade sector that makes matches, it is necessary to give some relief to the mechanized and semimechanized sectors."
15853,2005-06,"Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to 12 per cent on matches made by these two sectors."
15854,2005-06,"Handmade matches are fully exempt from excise duty and, therefore, will continue to enjoy adequate protection."
15855,2005-06,I would like to provide some tax relief to the small scale industry SSI.
15856,2005-06,"Hence, I propose to raise the ceiling for SSI exemption based on turnover from the level of Rs 3 crore per year to Rs 4 crore per year."
15857,2005-06,"Further, SSI units will now have only two options: either full exemption on the first clearance of Rs 1 crore or normal duty on the first clearance of Rs 1 crore with CENVAT credit."
15858,2005-06,I propose to restore the excise duty rate on iron and steel to the normal level of 16 per cent.
15859,2005-06,This should have little effect on prices because the entire duty is modvatable by most categories of consumers.
15860,2005-06,I propose to increase the specific duty on molasses from Rs 500 per MT to Rs 1000 per MT to adjust partially for a hefty increase in molasses prices.
15861,2005-06,I also propose to increase the specific duty on cement clinkers from Rs 250 per MT to Rs 350 per MT as an antiavoidance measure.
15862,2005-06,The National Highways Development Project requires very large resources.
15863,2005-06,"In order to raise additional resources, I propose to increase the cess on petrol and diesel by 50 paise per litre."
15864,2005-06,"The additional resources will be earmarked exclusively for the national highways, and a suitable amendment is being proposed to the Central Road Fund Act, 2000."
15865,2005-06,The levy of an education cess has been widely applauded.
15866,2005-06,The health sector demands similar treatment.
15867,2005-06,What better way is there to fund health care 27 than tax those goods which are health hazards?
15868,2005-06,"I, therefore, propose to raise some additional resources and allocate the proceeds to finance the National Rural Health Mission."
15869,2005-06,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the specific rate on cigarettes by about 10 per cent and impose a surcharge of 10 per cent on ad valorem duties on other tobacco products including gutka, chewing tobacco, snuff and pan masala."
15870,2005-06,"However, biris will not be subject to this levy."
15871,2005-06,"Finally, there is the issue of taxes on petroleum products."
15872,2005-06,"After examining the Lahiri committee’s report, I propose to make major changes in the customs and excise duty rates."
15873,2005-06,The customs duty on crude petroleum will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
15874,2005-06,"On LPG for domestic consumption and on subsidized kerosene, the customs duty will be nil."
15875,2005-06,"On both products, the excise duty will also be nil."
15876,2005-06,"On other petroleum products, including motor spirit MS and diesel HSD, I propose to reduce the customs duty from the current level of 20 or 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
15877,2005-06,I also propose to fix the excise duties on petrol and diesel as a combination of ad valorem and specific duties.
15878,2005-06,"The proposed changes are revenue neutral, and I have been assured that there will be no increase in the retail prices of these products as a result of the changes in the duty structure."
15879,2005-06,"Consequent upon the changes made in customs and excise duties, the drawback rates for exported goods will be reviewed and modifications, wherever necessary, will be notified by April 30, 2005."
15880,2005-06,"Hon’ble Members are aware that many goods are chargeable to excise duty on a value with reference to their maximum retail price MRP, after allowing suitable abatement."
15881,2005-06,The system of quantifying the abatement should be made transparent.
15882,2005-06,There should also be a mechanism to review the rate of abatement to reflect changed circumstances.
15883,2005-06,"Hence, as a trade facilitation measure, I propose to set up an advisory committee to advise the Government on the extent of abatement for both excise duty and service tax."
15884,2005-06,The other indirect tax is service tax.
15885,2005-06,Since the services sector accounts for about 52 percent of the GDP it is necessary to cast the net wide.
15886,2005-06,"Last July, I raised the rate of service tax to 10 per cent."
15887,2005-06,I propose to maintain that rate.
15888,2005-06,I also propose to grant relief to small service providers.
15889,2005-06,"Accordingly, I propose to exempt from service tax those service providers whose gross turnover does not exceed Rs 4 lakh per year."
15890,2005-06,"According to my calculation, 80 per cent of the present service tax payers will gain from the exemption."
15891,2005-06,I propose to include some additional services in the service tax net.
15892,2005-06,"New services to be covered include pipeline transport of goods; site formation, 28 demolition and like services; membership fees of clubs and associations; packaging and specialized mailing services; survey and map making services; dredging services in rivers and harbours; cleaning services for commercial buildings and similar premises; and construction of planned residential complexes, with more than 12 dwelling units, developed by builders."
15893,2005-06,"I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services, but I shall not burden you with the details."
15894,2005-06,Direct Taxes I shall now turn to my proposals on direct taxes.
15895,2005-06,"Last July, as an interim measure, I made a provision under which a person with a taxable income of Rs 100,000 would not be required to pay any income tax."
15896,2005-06,About 1.4 crore assessees got relief.
15897,2005-06,I promised to revisit the subject in this Budget.
15898,2005-06,"As part of a major overhaul of direct taxes, I propose to alter the tax brackets after taking due note of the universal demand of Members of Parliament and the need to provide stability in the medium term."
15899,2005-06,"Accordingly, I propose that the new tax brackets and the new rates will be as follows: Up to Rs 1 lakh .."
15900,2005-06,Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh ..
15901,2005-06,Rs 1.5 lakh to Rs 2.5 lakh ..
15902,2005-06,Hon’ble members will be happy to note that tax payers in every tax bracket will gain from my proposal.
15903,2005-06,"Besides, I propose to fix the threshold exemption level for women at Rs 1.25 lakh and the exemption level for senior citizens at Rs 1.5 lakh."
15904,2005-06,These revised exemption levels will be in lieu of the prevailing tax rebate provisions.
15905,2005-06,"Given the higher exemption limits and the scaling up of tax brackets, the need for a separate personal allowance does not exist."
15906,2005-06,"Therefore, in conformity with growing international practice, I propose to remove the standard deduction."
15907,2005-06,"There is now a plethora of exemptions, ostensibly intended to promote savings."
15908,2005-06,Some exemptions are based on the principle of deduction from taxable income and some exemptions are based on the principle of tax rebate.
15909,2005-06,I believe the time is ripe to clean up these exemptions.
15910,2005-06,"At the same time, it is necessary to encourage savings, and tax relief is a method to induce people to save."
15911,2005-06,"Further, I think that the State must be neutral between one form of saving and another, and allow the tax payer greater flexibility in making savings/investment decisions."
15912,2005-06,"For all these reasons, in addition to the basic exemption limits, I propose to allow every tax payer a consolidated limit of Rs 1 lakh for savings which will be deducted from the income before tax is calculated."
15913,2005-06,All prevailing sectoral caps will be removed.
15914,2005-06,The rebate under Section 88 is being eliminated and Section 80L is being omitted to reflect the new regime.
15915,2005-06,"In addition to the sum of Rs 1 lakh, the following six deductions will continue to receive the same tax treatment as prevails today: i interest paid on housing loan for selfoccupied house property; ii medical insurance premia; iii specified expenditure on disabled dependant; iv expenses for medical treatment for self or dependant or member of a HUF; v deduction in respect of interest on loans for pursuing higher studies; and vi deduction to a person with disability."
15916,2005-06,Tax treatment of savings is a complex issue but we can benefit from the best international practices in this regard.
15917,2005-06,We have already introduced EET based taxation in the defined contribution pension scheme applicable to newly recruited government servants.
15918,2005-06,"Before we fully migrate to the EET system for all kinds of savings, it is necessary to resolve a number of administrative issues."
15919,2005-06,"Hence, without making any change for the present, I propose to set up a committee of experts that will work out the road map for moving towards an EET system."
15920,2005-06,"Bowing to popular demand, I propose to continue the exemption from tax on interest earned on accounts maintained by Non Resident Indians."
15921,2005-06,"While the tax reliefs that I have given today should warm the hearts of the tax payers, I have also an obligation to raise resources, especially to meet the large requirements of NCMPmandated programmes."
15922,2005-06,"I have looked into the present system of taxing perquisites and I have found that many perquisites are disguised as fringe benefits, and escape tax."
15923,2005-06,Neither the employer nor the employee pays any tax on these benefits which are certainly of considerable material value.
15924,2005-06,"At present, where the benefits are fully attributable to the employee they are taxed in the hands of the employee; that position will continue."
15925,2005-06,"In addition, I now propose that where the benefits are usually enjoyed collectively by the employees and cannot be attributed to individual employees, they shall be taxed in the hands of the employer."
15926,2005-06,"However, transport services for workers and staff and canteen services in an office or factory will be outside the tax net."
15927,2005-06,"The tax is not a new tax, although I am obliged to call it by a new name, namely, Fringe Benefits Tax."
15928,2005-06,The rate will be 30 per cent on an appropriately defined base.
15929,2005-06,"I believe I have given a large measure of relief to personal income tax payers, and I hope all sections of the people and all members of the House are happy."
15930,2005-06,This leads me to corporate income tax.
15931,2005-06,"The corporate income tax rate, the surcharge thereon and the rates of depreciation are interlinked."
15932,2005-06,Any reform would have to address all three elements.
15933,2005-06,The international best practice is to provide for depreciation at rates that would enable the investor to replace the asset before its economic life ends.
15934,2005-06,"In India, in addition to the depreciation rate we have allowed an initial depreciation in order to encourage new investment."
15935,2005-06,"Hon’ble members may recall that, last July, I reduced the condition relating to increase in installed capacity from 25 per cent to 10 per cent."
15936,2005-06,"I am also obliged to keep in mind that a number of profit making companies continue to pay low tax, even if well within the law, by taking advantage of liberal depreciation rates and of exemptions and incentives."
15937,2005-06,"Moreover, the current depreciation rates lean towards employing capital rather than labour."
15938,2005-06,There is also a demand that corporate tax rates should be aligned with the highest marginal personal income tax rate.
15939,2005-06,"After careful consideration of the pros and cons, the interest of the revenue and the need to give the corporate sector a measure of relief, I propose the following tax structure."
15940,2005-06,"For domestic companies, the corporate income tax rate will be 30 per cent."
15941,2005-06,There will also be a surcharge of 10 percent.
15942,2005-06,"The rate of depreciation will be 15 per cent for general machinery and plant, but the initial depreciation rate will be increased to 20 per cent."
15943,2005-06,"The corporate sector will find that the proposed tax structure is fair, gives them relief of nearly 3 per cent in the tax rate, encourages new investment and ensures equity among all sections of corporate tax payers."
15944,2005-06,"As a further measure of relief, I propose to remove the requirement of 10 per cent increase in installed capacity for availing of the benefit of initial depreciation."
15945,2005-06,"To encourage technological upgradation, I propose to reduce the withholding tax on technical services from 20 per cent to 10 per cent."
15946,2005-06,I also propose that credit will be allowed for the Minimum Alternate Tax MAT paid under Section 115 JB of the Income Tax Act.
15947,2005-06,I do not propose to make any changes in the tax regime applicable to foreign companies.
15948,2005-06,"Last July, I had indicated that I would review the terminal dates on exemptions given for specific purposes."
15949,2005-06,"Accordingly, I propose to extend the terminal date, in the following three cases, from March 31, 2005 to March 31, 2007:"
15950,2005-06,"Weighted deduction of 150 per cent of expenditure on inhouse research and development facilities of companies engaged in the business of biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, electronics, telecommunication, chemicals or any other notified product; Deduction of profits of new industrial undertakings in Jammu & Kashmir; 100 per cent deduction of profits of companies carrying on scientific research and development and approved by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research."
15951,2005-06,"In deference to the request from Air India and Indian Airlines, I propose to extend up to September 30, 2005 the exemption from tax on agreements to acquire aircraft or aircraft engines on lease."
15952,2005-06,"The securities transaction tax STT has stabilized, but the rates are widely perceived to be too low."
15953,2005-06,"I, therefore, propose to make a very nominal increase in the rates for all categories of transactions."
15954,2005-06,"Thus, a day trader who is liable to pay STT at 0.015 per cent will now be liable to pay at 0.02 per cent."
15955,2005-06,This small increase should not ruffle anyone’s feathers.
15956,2005-06,This nominal rate of increase will apply to all categories.
15957,2005-06,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, there have been significant developments in the past decade in the capital market including the introduction of trading in financial derivatives."
15958,2005-06,We have also established a transparent system of trading with adequate safeguards for audit trail.
15959,2005-06,"Hence, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that trading in derivatives in specified stock exchanges will not be treated as “speculative transactions” for the purposes of the Income Tax Act."
15960,2005-06,I propose to amend the oneinsix criteria for filing income tax returns.
15961,2005-06,Mobile telephone will be removed.
15962,2005-06,"Instead, payment for electricity of more than Rs 50,000 per year will be included as a criterion for filing a return of income."
15963,2005-06,The NCMP requires the Government to introduce special schemes to unearth black money and assets.
15964,2005-06,"I am obliged to carry out the mandate, but without giving undeserved relief or an amnesty."
15965,2005-06,"I am concerned about large cash transactions, especially withdrawals of cash, when there is no ostensible purpose to withdraw such large amounts of cash."
15966,2005-06,"These cash withdrawals leave no trail, and presumably become part of the black economy."
15967,2005-06,"Therefore, I propose to introduce two anti taxevasion measures: Firstly, I propose to levy a tax on withdrawal of cash on a single day of over Rs 10,000 or more from banks at the rate of 0.1 per cent."
15968,2005-06,"Thus, a person withdrawing Rs 10,000 in cash would have to pay a small sum of Rs 10."
15969,2005-06,"Secondly, I propose to require banks to report to the 32 Government all deposits which are exempt from TDS on interest."
15970,2005-06,I intend to observe the results of these steps before I propose any further measures.
15971,2005-06,Many administrative reforms are underway in the Department of Revenue.
15972,2005-06,Among them are the tax information network TIN and the online tax accounting system OLTAS.
15973,2005-06,"As a measure of facilitation, I propose to follow international practice and establish large taxpayer units LTUs."
15974,2005-06,"To begin with, these units will be set up in major cities."
15975,2005-06,"I would like to invite large tax payers, whether of corporate tax or income tax or excise duties or service tax, to participate in the programme and avail of the single window service."
15976,2005-06,"For small taxpayers, I propose to set up Help Centres in cooperation with industry associations, professional bodies and NGOs."
15977,2005-06,I have received many suggestions on amendments to the direct tax laws and the indirect tax laws.
15978,2005-06,"I have decided to accept some suggestions that require to be acted upon immediately, but I do not propose to burden the Finance Bill with those changes."
15979,2005-06,"Instead, I intend to introduce a separate Bill for that purpose during this session."
15980,2005-06,"In due course, I intend to place before Parliament a revised and simplified Income Tax Bill."
15981,2005-06,"My tax proposals on direct taxes are expected to yield a gain of Rs 6,000 crore."
15982,2005-06,"On the indirect taxes side, they are broadly revenue neutral."
15983,2005-06,"CONCLUSION Mr. Speaker, Sir, 182."
15984,2005-06,"One of India’s proudest sons, Dr Amartya Sen, argues in his book “Development as Freedom” that development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy."
15985,2005-06,"He says, “Growth of GNP or of individual incomes can, of course, be very important as means to expanding the freedoms enjoyed by the members of the society."
15986,2005-06,"But freedoms depend also on other determinants, such as social and economic arrangements for example, facilities for education and health care as well as political and civil rights.”"
15987,2005-06,"The UPA Government accepts this ethical dimension to the discussion of economic issues, and in this Budget I have attempted to reflect that dimension."
15988,2005-06,"More or less the same idea was articulated two thousand years ago by Saint Tiruvalluvar who said: “Pini Inmai Selvam Vilaivu Inbam Emam Ani Enba Nattirkku Iv Iyndhu” Health, wealth, produce, the happiness that is the result, and security These five, the learned say, are the ornaments of a polity 183."
15989,2005-06,"This Budget, Mr Speaker, is an attempt to lay down a path in which growth and equity will reinforce each other and build a new India."
15990,2005-06,"Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
15991,2006-07,It is my privilege to present the Budget for the year 200607.
15992,2006-07,I AN OVERVIEW OF THE ECONOMY 2.
15993,2006-07,"Twenty months ago, when I presented the first Budget of the UPA Government, I asked Honourable Members – and the people of this country – to walk with us on the path of honour and courage."
15994,2006-07,"The final report card on the first year of the UPA Government is out, and there are reasons to celebrate."
15995,2006-07,"According to the Central Statistical Organization CSO, the growth rate in 200405 was 7.5 per cent, with the manufacturing sector growing at 8.1 per cent."
15996,2006-07,"More importantly, at current market prices, gross domestic saving increased to 29.1 per cent of GDP and the rate of gross capital formation increased to 30.1 per cent of GDP."
15997,2006-07,"I have no doubt in my mind that these results were due to the political message conveyed by the National Common Minimum Programme NCMP; the perceptive leadership of the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh; the policy changes made by the Government; and the palpable confidence of the Indian people that their future is in safe hands."
15998,2006-07,"I am happy to report that the prospects for 200506 are just as good, if not better."
15999,2006-07,This year can be characterized as the best of times and the worst of times.
16000,2006-07,Nature has not been kind to us.
16001,2006-07,"Natural calamities took a heavy toll on human lives besides causing extensive damage to crops, roads, houses, and the infrastructure."
16002,2006-07,Government provided immediate interim relief; this was followed by releases from the CRF and NCCF totalling Rs  5145.37 crore to date.
16003,2006-07,"Obviously, this assistance will not be enough."
16004,2006-07,"The Planning Commission will draw up a programme for rebuilding the damaged infrastructure, and I wish to assure the House that the Government will provide the money for rehabilitation and reconstruction."
16005,2006-07,It was also the best of times.
16006,2006-07,Government has been able to fulfil the first NCMP obligation of ensuring a high growth rate.
16007,2006-07,"According to the CSO’s advance 2 estimates, GDP growth is likely to be 8.1 per cent this year, with the manufacturing sector expected to grow at 9.4 per cent."
16008,2006-07,"Agricultural growth has bounced back to 2.3 per cent and, barring mining, all other sectors are performing satisfactorily."

16010,2006-07,Nonfood credit is growing by over 25 per cent.
16011,2006-07,"A large part of the credit goes to our farmers, workers, service providers, traders and business persons, and I would urge the House to join me in saluting them."
16012,2006-07,The assault on poverty and unemployment continues.
16013,2006-07,I believe that growth is the best antidote to poverty.
16014,2006-07,The GDP growth target for the Tenth Plan was set at 8 per cent.
16015,2006-07,"Thanks to three years of 7.5 per cent plus growth, it is possible that the overall growth rate will be 7 per cent."
16016,2006-07,"In recent speeches, the Prime Minister has raised the bar to 10 per cent, and the Government is determined to take the country to that high growth path."
16017,2006-07,Growth will be our mount; equity will be our companion; and social justice will be our destination.
16018,2006-07,IMPLEMENTING THE NCMP MANDATE 6.
16019,2006-07,"Our success this year is due to our unrelenting emphasis on fiscal prudence through enhanced revenues and expenditure control, monetary stability and management of the external debt."
16020,2006-07,"However, our success should not tempt us to stray from this path, and we shall not do so."
16021,2006-07,"One of the important NCMP obligations was to focus on agriculture: we have done so, and the output of food grains is expected to be 209.3 million tonnes, which is about 5 million tonnes more than in the previous year."
16022,2006-07,"The NCMP mandates the Government to promote employment: while creating permanent and quality jobs in the productive sectors, for providing immediate relief to the poor, the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was launched on February 2, 2006."

16025,2006-07,Several indicators point to continued buoyancy of capital formation in the economy.
16026,2006-07,The NCMP also mandates the Government to augment infrastructure.
16027,2006-07,"Until December, 2005, under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana, contracts have been placed for projects spanning 95 districts and covering 41,461 unelectrified and 9,379 electrified villages."

16032,2006-07,I would like to make special mention of Bharat Nirman.
16033,2006-07,It epitomizes the UPA’s approach to governance.
16034,2006-07,It is a paradigm shift that will enable us to use the resources thrown up by the engine of growth for building infrastructure and bringing basic amenities to rural India.
16035,2006-07,Honourable Members are aware of the six components of Bharat Nirman and the ambitious targets to be achieved by the year 2009.

16039,2006-07,"The entire allocation for rural electrification of Rs 1,100 crore has been released and the target of covering 10,366 villages is expected to be achieved in the current fiscal."
16040,2006-07,These numbers are a complete answer to those who scoffed at Bharat Nirman.
16041,2006-07,"We are determined to soldier on, and execute the programme in the mission mode."
16042,2006-07,"Since the implementation of Bharat Nirman has gathered pace, I propose to extend larger budgetary support to the programme."
16043,2006-07,"Including the North East component, as against Rs 12,160 crore provided in the current year, the corresponding budgetary provision will be Rs 18,696 crore in 200607, an increase of 54 per cent."
16044,2006-07,Let me now present an overview of the Budget.
16045,2006-07,"Obviously, the bulk of 4 the resources must go to the UPA Government’s eight flagship programmes: Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, Midday Meal Scheme, Rajiv Gandhi Drinking Water Mission, Total Sanitation Campaign, National Rural Health Mission, Integrated Child Development Services, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission."

16057,2006-07,"For the flagship programmes alone, this would amount to an additional allocation of Rs 4,870 crore in 200607."

16101,2006-07,I would urge State Governments to make an equal contribution from their resources so that a destitute pensioner would get at least Rs 400 per month.
16102,2006-07,"I also propose to work with the Department of Posts and the banks to establish, within two years, a system under which the pension will be credited directly to the account of the beneficiary in a post office or a bank."
16103,2006-07,"Last year, I introduced a statement highlighting the gender sensitivities of the budgetary allocations."
16104,2006-07,I was able to cover 10 demands for grants.
16105,2006-07,"This time, I have been able to enlarge the statement on gender budgeting to include schemes where 100 per cent of the allocation is for the benefit of women as well as schemes where at least 30 per cent of the allocation is targeted towards women."

16130,2006-07,"The Outcome Budget for 200607 will be placed before this House by March 17, 2006."
16131,2006-07,This new approach underscores our resolve to ensure that the intended services in the right quantity and quality are delivered to the aam admi.
16132,2006-07,There is an investment boom in the country and it is necessary to maintain the confidence of investors.
16133,2006-07,It appears that India is catching up with the high investment rates of East Asia and China.

16146,2006-07,Let me now turn to the productive sectors of the economy.
16147,2006-07,"As always, our Government’s focus is on agriculture."
16148,2006-07,"Assured irrigation, credit, diversification and creating a market for agricultural products are the thrust areas."

16159,2006-07,"I propose to ask the banks to increase the level of credit to Rs 175,000 crore in 200607 and also add another 50 lakh farmers to their portfolio."
16160,2006-07,We shall not only achieve but exceed the target of doubling farm credit in three years.
16161,2006-07,"Since tenant farmers are not adequately served, I have asked the banks to open a separate window for selfhelp groups or joint liability groups of tenant farmers and ensure that a certain proportion of the total credit is extended to them."
16162,2006-07,I intend to monitor closely progress in this behalf.
16163,2006-07,I am aware of the severe difficulties faced by farmers in the last two years.
16164,2006-07,Ours is a compassionate Government.
16165,2006-07,I also have severe fiscal constraints.
16166,2006-07,"When faced with a dilemma, I usually turn to my favourite poetphilosopher, Saint Tiruvalluvar."
16167,2006-07,"Writing over 2,000 years ago, he said: “Karumam Sidhaiyamal Kannoda Vallarku Urimai Udaithu Iv Ulagu”The world is his who does his jobWith compassion I am prepared to go the extra mile to come to the aid of our farmers."
16168,2006-07,"To begin with, I propose to grant some relief to the farmers who have availed of crop loans from scheduled commercial banks, RRBs and PACS for Kharif and Rabi 200506.Accordingly,anamountequaltotwopercentagepointsoftheborrower’s interest liability on the principal amount up to Rs 100,000, will be credited to his/her bank account before March 31, 2006."
16169,2006-07,"I have provided a sum of Rs 1,700 crore for this purpose."
16170,2006-07,I hope the House will welcome this exceptional gesture of the Government.
16171,2006-07,"For our farmers, I have more."
16172,2006-07,"Farmers obtain shortterm credit from the cooperative credit structure and Regional Rural Banks RRBs, with refinance from NABARD."
16173,2006-07,"Increasingly, scheduled commercial banks are also lending more to farmers."
16174,2006-07,"It is my intention to ensure that NABARD continues to provide refinance at an economical rate, so that the farmer ultimately gets the loan at a reasonable rate."
16175,2006-07,"Accordingly, after giving anxious consideration to market conditions, Government has decided to ensure that the farmer receives short term credit at 7 per cent, with an upper limit of Rs 300,000 on the principal amount."
16176,2006-07,This would require a certain level of subvention to NABARD.
16177,2006-07,I propose to give the subvention.
16178,2006-07,"This policy will come into force with effect from Kharif 200607, and I shall make a detailed statement in due course."
16179,2006-07,The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF has so far disbursed funds in 11 tranches.
16180,2006-07,"RIDF XI sanctions have touched a level of Rs 7,301 crore as on January 31, 2006."
16181,2006-07,A special feature this year has been that Rs 346 crore has been sanctioned to the North Eastern States.
16182,2006-07,This sum is likely to touch Rs 600 crore by the year end.
16183,2006-07,"Keeping in view the expanding requirements for creating rural infrastructure, I propose to increase the corpus of RIDF XII to Rs 10,000 crore, and I urge State Governments to make the best use of these funds."

16376,2006-07,"In 2007, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of the First War of Indian Independence, an event that shaped the destiny of the nation."
16377,2006-07,"To ensure that the event is observed in a befitting manner, I propose to make a provision of Rs 10 crore for preparatory activities."
16378,2006-07,"Two Gandhian institutions, the National Gandhi Museum, Rajghat and the Kasturba Gandhi National Memorial Fund, Indore deserve support."
16379,2006-07,I intend to provide Rs 5 crore each to the corpus of these institutions in 200607.
16380,2006-07,Backward Regions Grant Fund 20 107.
16381,2006-07,"I am happy to inform the House that Kuttiyattam, Vedic Chanting and Ramlila have been declared ‘Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity’ by the UNESCO."
16382,2006-07,These old art forms and oral traditions need to be safeguarded.
16383,2006-07,"Pending drawing up a detailed scheme, I propose to make an initial provision of Rs 5 crore in 200607."
16384,2006-07,XII FISCAL CONSOLIDATION Twelfth Finance Commission 108.
16385,2006-07,The recommendations of the Twelfth Finance Commission TFC are being implemented.
16386,2006-07,"Cumulatively, State loans amounting to Rs 103,710 crore have been consolidated so far."
16387,2006-07,"Under the new scheme of tax devolution, Rs 94,402 crore will be released as the States’ share in the current year compared to Rs 78,595 crore in 200405."
16388,2006-07,"As regards grantsinaid, the amounts granted in 200405 and 200506 RE are Rs 12,081 crore and Rs 25,134 crore respectively."
16389,2006-07,"In 200607, both the tax devolution and the grants will be substantially higher."
16390,2006-07,"The States have never been so well provided, as you will find from the Budget papers."
16391,2006-07,I may add that I have made appropriate provision in the Budget for debt consolidation and relief.
16392,2006-07,"I have also provided Rs 3,000 crore towards compensation for VAT losses, if any, in 200607."
16393,2006-07,"The issue of subsidies is proving to be a divisive one, but I would urge Honourable Members that it is imperative that we make progress on this front if we are serious about targeting subsidies at the poor and the truly needy."
16394,2006-07,"My Ministry has held extensive discussions with stakeholders on three major subsidies, namely, food, fertilizer and petroleum."
16395,2006-07,We have also sought the views of the general public.
16396,2006-07,"Working groups/committees have gone into the question of fertilizer and petroleum subsidies, the latest being the Dr. C. Rangarajan Committee."
16397,2006-07,I would urge Members to help the Government evolve a consensus on the issue of subsidies.
16398,2006-07,Gross Budgetary Support and Gross Fiscal Deficit 111.
16399,2006-07,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, please allow me to draw your attention to two path breaking developments on the fiscal front."
16400,2006-07,"Firstly, the strategy of enhanced revenue mobilization through reasonable rates, better compliance and widening of the tax base is yielding tangible results."
16401,2006-07,"For the Centre, the gross taxGDP ratio, after rising from 9.2 per cent in 200304 to 9.8 per cent in 200405, has increased further to 10.5 per cent in 200506 RE."
16402,2006-07,"Government estimates that, through better tax administration, it will increase to 11.2 per cent in 200607BE."
16403,2006-07,"Secondly, the year 200405, for which the actuals are available, has proved to be a turning point."
16404,2006-07,"After 20 years, the Gross Fiscal Deficit is less than the Gross Budgetary Support for Plan in that year."
16405,2006-07,This means 21 that Government is not financing the Plan entirely through borrowing.
16406,2006-07,Whether this trend continued in 200506 will be known only after the actuals are available.
16407,2006-07,"However, in the BE for 200607, I have been able to confine the gross fiscal deficit to a number much smaller than the gross budgetary support for the Plan."
16408,2006-07,"Last year, reluctantly, I pressed the ‘pause’ button on fiscal correction."
16409,2006-07,I had estimated the revenue deficit for 200506 at 2.7 per cent and the fiscal deficit at 4.3 per cent.
16410,2006-07,I am happy to report that I have been proved wrong.
16411,2006-07,We have improved upon both measures.
16412,2006-07,"According to revised estimates, the revenue deficit for the current year will be only 2.6 per cent and the fiscal deficit will be only 4.1 per cent."
16413,2006-07,XIII BUDGET ESTIMATES FOR 200607114.
16414,2006-07,I turn to the Budget Estimates for the next fiscal.
16415,2006-07,"Plan expenditure for 200607 is estimated at Rs 172,728 crore, up by 20.4 per cent."
16416,2006-07,"As a proportion of total expenditure, Plan expenditure has increased from 26.6 per cent in 200405 to 28.3 per cent in 200506 RE and further to 30.6 per cent in 200607 BE."
16417,2006-07,This points to the improvement in the quality of Government expenditure.
16418,2006-07,"NonPlan expenditure in 200607 is estimated to be Rs 391,263 crore."
16419,2006-07,The increase of 5.5 per cent over nonplan expenditure in 200506 BE is due to normal growth and is one the smallest in recent years.
16420,2006-07,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit 117.
16421,2006-07,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the Budget Estimates for 200607, the total expenditure is estimated at Rs 563,991 crore."
16422,2006-07,"I estimate total revenue receipts of the Central Government at Rs 403,465 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs 488,192 crore."
16423,2006-07,"Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs 84,727 crore which is 2.1 per cent of the GDP."
16424,2006-07,"The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 148,686 crore, which is 3.8 per cent of the GDP."
16425,2006-07,I believe that I have redeemed my promise that the process of fiscal correction will be resumed in 200607.
16426,2006-07,XIV TAX PROPOSALS 22 PARTB 118.
16427,2006-07,"Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals."
16428,2006-07,"In the UPA Government’s first Budget, and more so in the second, I had attempted significant tax reforms."
16429,2006-07,"In 200405, gross tax revenues provisional actuals increased by 19.9 per cent over the actuals of the previous year and, according to Revised Estimates, in 200506, they are expected to increase by 21.4 per cent over the provisional actuals of the previous year."
16430,2006-07,These figures confirm our belief that we should keep our tax rates moderate and stable.
16431,2006-07,Indirect Taxes I shall begin with my proposals on indirect taxes.
16432,2006-07,"In line with the Government’s policy of reducing customs duties, I propose to reduce the peak rate for nonagricultural products from 15 per cent to 12.5 per cent."
16433,2006-07,I believe that we are now only a short distance away from East Asian rates.
16434,2006-07,"As the peak rate comes down, there is a need to reduce the duty on raw materials and intermediates."
16435,2006-07,The duty on primary steel is at 5 per cent.
16436,2006-07,I propose to reduce the duty on alloy steel and primary and secondary nonferrous metals from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
16437,2006-07,This will also be the rate of duty for ferro alloys.
16438,2006-07,"In 200405, in view of the high international prices of steel, I had reduced the import duty on steel melting scrap to zero."
16439,2006-07,"With prices of steel coming down, I propose to restore the duty to 5 per cent and bring it on par with primary steel."
16440,2006-07,The duty on mineral products is now 15 per cent.
16441,2006-07,"I propose to reduce it to 5 per cent, with a few exceptions."
16442,2006-07,I also propose to reduce the duty on ores and concentrates from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.
16443,2006-07,Refractories attract a duty of 10 per cent.
16444,2006-07,A number of materials required for manufacture of refractories are also at 10 per cent or higher rates.
16445,2006-07,I propose to reduce these duties to 7.5 per cent.
16446,2006-07,Basic inorganic chemicals are crucial raw materials.
16447,2006-07,I propose to reduce the duty from 15 per cent to 10 per cent.
16448,2006-07,"On basic cyclic and acyclic hydrocarbons and their derivatives, I propose to bring down the rate to 5 per cent."
16449,2006-07,I also propose to reduce the duty on catalysts from 10 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
16450,2006-07,Plastics are important raw materials.
16451,2006-07,"Hence, I propose to reduce the duty on major bulk plastics like PVC, LDPE and PP from 10 per cent to 5 per cent."
16452,2006-07,"Simultaneously, the duty on naptha for plastics will be reduced to nil."
16453,2006-07,"I propose to reduce the duty on styrene, EDC and VCM which are raw materials for plastics to 2 per cent."
16454,2006-07,I propose to give some concessions to vital drugs.
16455,2006-07,I propose to reduce the customs duty on 10 antiAIDS and 14 anticancer drugs to 5 per cent.
16456,2006-07,"I also propose to reduce the duty on certain life saving drugs, kits and equipment from 15 per cent to 5 per cent."
16457,2006-07,These drugs will also be exempt from excise duty and countervailing duty CVD.
16458,2006-07,"Packaging machines serve a wide variety of industries, including food processing."
16459,2006-07,I propose to reduce the duty on packaging machines from 15 per cent to 5 per cent.
16460,2006-07,"I propose to extend the concessional project rate of 10 per cent to pipeline projects for transportation of natural gas, crude petroleum and petroleum products."
16461,2006-07,Honourable Members would recall that last year I had taken the power to impose a CVD on all imports to compensate for State level taxes.
16462,2006-07,"This levy was applied only to imports of ITA bound items and their inputs, except IT software."
16463,2006-07,"After the introduction of VAT in most States, I have received representations from trade and industry that this levy should be extended to all imports."
16464,2006-07,"The argument is persuasive, and I propose to impose a CVD of 4 per cent on all imports with a few exceptions."
16465,2006-07,Full credit of this duty will be allowed to manufacturers of excisable goods.
16466,2006-07,"In order to protect the domestic vanaspati industry, I propose to increase the customs duty on vanaspati to 80 per cent, the rate applicable to crude palm oil."
16467,2006-07,Export oriented units EOUs are allowed to clear their goods to the Domestic Tariff Area DTA at a concessional rate.
16468,2006-07,"With declining import duties, DTA units and EOUs should have a level playing field as regards excise duty or CVD."
16469,2006-07,"Hence, I propose to adjust the duty rates on clearances by EOUs to the DTA at 25 per cent of basic customs duty plus excise duty on like goods."
16470,2006-07,"This will still give the EOU a tariff advantage or, at any rate, in most cases, it will be on par with a DTA unit."
16471,2006-07,"Finally, I have an important proposal that involves both excise and customs duties."
16472,2006-07,Cotton textile industry has greatly benefited from the relief granted two years ago.
16473,2006-07,The manmade textile industry is a growth and employmentdriver.
16474,2006-07,"Hence, I propose to reduce the excise duty on all man made fibre yarn and filament yarn from 16 per cent to 8 per cent."
16475,2006-07,"Simultaneously, I propose to reduce the import duty on all manmade fibres and yarns from 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
16476,2006-07,"Consequently, the import duty on raw materials such as DMT, PTA and MEG will also be reduced from 15 per cent to 10 per cent."
16477,2006-07,The import duty on paraxylene is proposed to be reduced to 2 per cent.
16478,2006-07,I have a few proposals on the excise side.
16479,2006-07,I reiterate that it is our intention to converge all rates at the CENVAT rate which is now at 16 per cent.
16480,2006-07,There are only two items – aerated drinks and cars – that still attract the higher rate of 24 per cent.
16481,2006-07,I propose to correct this substantially.
16482,2006-07,I propose to reduce the excise 24 duty on aerated drinks to 16 per cent.
16483,2006-07,"On cars, I propose to reduce the excise duty to 16 per cent, but only for small cars."
16484,2006-07,"A small car, for this purpose, will mean a car of length not exceeding 4,000 mm and with an engine capacity not exceeding 1,500 cc for diesel cars and not exceeding 1,200 cc for petrol cars."
16485,2006-07,I am confident that industry will seize the opportunity to make India a hub for the manufacture of small and fuelefficient cars.
16486,2006-07,I propose to impose an 8 per cent excise duty on packaged software sold over the counter.
16487,2006-07,Customized software and software packages downloaded from the internet will be exempt from this levy.
16488,2006-07,"I propose to fully exempt from excise duty DVD Drives, Flash Drives and Combo Drives."
16489,2006-07,"Many food items, including packaged items, attract nil excise duty."
16490,2006-07,"With a view to giving a fillip to the food processing industry, I propose to fully exempt from excise duty condensed milk, ice cream, preparations of meat, fish and poultry, pectins, pasta and yeast."
16491,2006-07,"Excise duty on readytoeat packaged foods and instant food mixes, like dosa and idli mixes, will be reduced from 16 per cent to 8 per cent."
16492,2006-07,"Since leather and footwear are thrust sectors, I propose to exempt from excise duty two vegetable tanning extracts, namely, quebracho and chestnut."
16493,2006-07,Footwear carrying a retail sale price up to Rs 250 is already exempt from excise duty.
16494,2006-07,I propose to reduce excise duty on footwear with a retail sale price between Rs 250 and Rs 750 from 16 per cent to 8 per cent.
16495,2006-07,"At present LPG stoves up to a value of Rs 2,000 attract excise duty of 8 per cent."
16496,2006-07,I propose to extend the concessional rate to all LPG stoves without any value limit.
16497,2006-07,"To promote the use of energy efficient lamps, I propose to reduce the excise duty on compact fluorescent lamps from 16 per cent to 8 per cent."
16498,2006-07,I propose to remove rate differences between different kinds of tableware and kitchenware.
16499,2006-07,"Consequently, glassware will attract excise duty of 16 per cent on par with ceramicware and plasticware."
16500,2006-07,Paper finds widespread use in education as well as in packaging.
16501,2006-07,"In order to encourage capacity addition, I propose to reduce excise duty on specified printing, writing and packing paper from 16 per cent to 12 per cent."
16502,2006-07,Domestically produced petroleum crude is subject to a cess under the Oil Industries Development Act.
16503,2006-07,"The rate of Rs 1,800 per metric tonne was fixed in 2002."
16504,2006-07,"After consulting the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, I propose to increase the cess to Rs 2,500 per MT."
16505,2006-07,I have been assured that this increase will be absorbed by the oil producing companies and have no impact on retail prices of petroleum products.
16506,2006-07,There are two requests from trade and industry.
16507,2006-07,I had exempted computers from excise duty in order to boost the use of computers.
16508,2006-07,That purpose has been largely served.
16509,2006-07,Domestic manufacturers have sought reimposition of excise duty at 12 per cent in order to enable them to take CENVAT credit as well as to face competition from imports.
16510,2006-07,I propose to accept the request.
16511,2006-07,"Since the 12 per cent excise duty will be eligible for full input tax credit, there should not be any impact on price."
16512,2006-07,The second request is to impose excise duty on set top boxes.
16513,2006-07,"I propose to accept the request and levy an excise duty of 16 per cent and, at the same time, reduce the customs duty from 15 per cent to nil."
16514,2006-07,This change will equalize the duty rates on various types of set top boxes.
16515,2006-07,"To round off, I would be failing in my duty if I did not raise the excise duty on cigarettes."
16516,2006-07,"Hence, I propose to increase the excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent."
16517,2006-07,The bane of excise and customs tariffs is the plethora of exemptions.
16518,2006-07,"On the basis of a comprehensive review, I propose to remove many exemptions that were granted through notifications."
16519,2006-07,"Broadly, exemptions that are enduse based or have outlived their utility or need certification or give rise to disputes are being rescinded, with only a few exceptions."
16520,2006-07,"The exemption for the SSI sector will, however, remain unchanged."
16521,2006-07,We have also identified some more notifications which need to be removed.
16522,2006-07,"However, before taking a final view, I propose to put a list of such notifications on the Ministry’s website and invite comments."
16523,2006-07,"In 200506, the services sector is estimated to contribute 54 per cent of GDP."
16524,2006-07,"Naturally, it should also contribute significantly to the exchequer."
16525,2006-07,"Continuing in the direction followed in the last few years, I propose to bring more services under the service tax net."
16526,2006-07,"The new services to be covered include ATM operations, maintenance and management; registrars, share transfer agents and bankers to an issue; sale of space or time, other than in the print media, for advertisements; sponsorship of events, other than sports events, by companies; international air travel excluding economy class passengers; container services on rail, excluding the railway freight charges; business support services; auctioneering; recovery agents; ship management services; travel on cruise ships; and public relations management services."
16527,2006-07,I also propose to expand the coverage of certain services now subject to service tax.
16528,2006-07,I do not wish to burden the House with the details which are available in the Budget papers.
16529,2006-07,"The leasing and hire purchase industry has faced some difficulty owing to the levy of service tax on all components of payments, including interest."
16530,2006-07,I propose to rectify the anomaly.
16531,2006-07,"Accordingly, interest and instalments of the principal amount will be abated in calculating the value of the service."
16532,2006-07,It is my sense that there is a large consensus that the country should move towards a national level Goods and Services Tax GST that should be shared between the Centre and the States.
16533,2006-07,"I propose that we set April 1, 2010 as the date for introducing GST."
16534,2006-07,"World over, goods and services attract the same rate of tax."
16535,2006-07,That is the foundation of a GST.
16536,2006-07,People must get used to the idea of a GST.
16537,2006-07,"Hence, we must progressively converge the service tax rate and the CENVAT rate."
16538,2006-07,I propose to take one step this year and increase the service tax rate from 10 per cent to 12 per cent.
16539,2006-07,"Let me hasten to add that since service tax paid can be credited against service tax payable or excise duty payable, the net impact will be very small."
16540,2006-07,Direct Taxes I shall now turn to my proposals on direct taxes.
16541,2006-07,The good news is that there will be no change in the rates of personal income tax or corporate income tax.
16542,2006-07,The other piece of good news is that no new taxes are being imposed.
16543,2006-07,The onebysix scheme under the Income Tax Act obliging certain categories of persons to file returns will stand abolished.
16544,2006-07,I propose to marginally revise certain tax rates in the quest for equity.
16545,2006-07,"While the corporate tax rate is 30 per cent, the rate under Minimum Alternate Tax MAT is only 7.5 per cent of book profits."
16546,2006-07,"I propose to increase the rate to 10 per cent, which is still only onethird of the normal rate."
16547,2006-07,I also propose to include longterm capital gains arising out of securities in calculating book profits.
16548,2006-07,I have already allowed MATpaying companies to take credit for MAT over five years.
16549,2006-07,I propose to extend the period to seven years as well as adjust MAT credit while calculating interest liability.
16550,2006-07,The rates for the Securities Transaction Tax STT were fixed when prices of securities were much lower.
16551,2006-07,"Reflecting the increase in implicit capital gains in securities transactions, I propose an increase of 25 per cent, across the board, on all rates of STT."
16552,2006-07,Section 80IA of the Income Tax Act applies to infrastructure facilities.
16553,2006-07,"For developing an industrial park the terminal date is March 31, 2006."
16554,2006-07,"I propose to extend the period to March 31, 2009."
16555,2006-07,"For the power sector, in view of the ultra mega projects, I propose to extend the date to March 31, 2010."
16556,2006-07,"Last year, I recast the provisions relating to savings."
16557,2006-07,Fixed deposits were not included.
16558,2006-07,There is a demand that fixed deposits of certain tenure should qualify for tax exemption.
16559,2006-07,I propose to include investments in fixed deposits in scheduled banks for a term of not less than five years in section 80C of the Income Tax Act.
16560,2006-07,"I also propose to remove the limit of Rs 10,000 in respect of contribution to certain pension funds in section 80CCC, subject to the overall ceiling of Rs 100,000."
16561,2006-07,I propose to align the definition of openended equityoriented schemes of mutual funds in the Income Tax Act with the definition adopted by SEBI.
16562,2006-07,I also propose to treat openended equityoriented schemes and closeended equity oriented schemes on par for the purpose of exemption from dividend distribution tax.
16563,2006-07,I have revisited the exemptions in the Income Tax Act.
16564,2006-07,"As a result, I propose to remove the exemption under section 1023G which is not relevant when interest rates are moderate."
16565,2006-07,"Cooperative banks, like any other bank, are lending institutions and should pay tax on their profits."
16566,2006-07,Primary Agricultural Credit Societies PACS and Primary Cooperative Agricultural and Rural Development Banks PCARDB stand on a special footing and will continue to be exempt from tax under section 80P of the Income Tax Act.
16567,2006-07,"However, I propose to exclude all other cooperative banks from the scope of that section."
16568,2006-07,Section 54EC and section 54ED are tax shelters.
16569,2006-07,"I propose to restrict the scope of section 54EC to two institutions, viz., NHAI and REC."
16570,2006-07,"For NABARD, SIDBI and NHB, which are banks, we have already opened the route of zero coupon bonds to raise low cost funds."
16571,2006-07,"Government will, if needed, provide appropriate support to these institutions to enable them to access resources to fulfil their mandate effectively."
16572,2006-07,"I also propose to withdraw the benefit of section 54ED, which has become virtually redundant, with effect from April 1, 2006."
16573,2006-07,The Standing Committee on Finance has expressed concern that many charitable institutions misuse the provisions of the Income Tax Act.
16574,2006-07,"I propose to focus on one misuse, namely, receiving anonymous or pseudonymous donations."
16575,2006-07,"Accordingly, I propose that anonymous or pseudonymous donations to wholly charitable institutions will be taxed at the highest marginal rate."
16576,2006-07,Such donations to partly religious and partly charitable institutions/trusts will be taxed only if the donation is specifically for an educational or medical purpose.
16577,2006-07,"However, I make it clear that such donations to wholly religious institutions and religious trusts will not be covered by the new provision."
16578,2006-07,Members of State Legislatures have complained that their constituency allowances are taxed differently from the constituency allowance received by Members of Parliament.
16579,2006-07,I propose to remove the discrimination and treat them equally.
16580,2006-07,The Permanent Account Number PAN of the Department of Income Tax is the critical element in capturing incomes and expenditures.
16581,2006-07,Scrutiny of Annual Information Returns AIR on highvalue transactions reveals that 60 per cent of the transactions are without quoting PAN.
16582,2006-07,"Hence, I propose to take the power to issue PAN suo motu in certain cases."
16583,2006-07,I also propose to take the power to direct persons to apply for PAN in certain cases.
16584,2006-07,"I propose to notify, in due course, more transactions for which quoting of PAN will be mandatory."
16585,2006-07,I also propose to prescribe a few more transactions to be reported in AIRs  28 171.
16586,2006-07,"Last year, I introduced two new taxes."
16587,2006-07,"The Banking Cash Transaction Tax BCTT has turned out to be a boon, not for the modest revenues it brought which was never its purpose, but for the remarkable trails that it has helped establish."
16588,2006-07,"To cite just one example, huge cash withdrawals in a bank branch in Chandni Chowk, noticed through the BCTT, led the Department of Income Tax to three entities which were carrying on the business of purchasing demand drafts from traders at a discount and helping the traders to avoid both sales tax and income tax."
16589,2006-07,These entities would deposit the demand drafts in their own accounts and withdraw the cash.
16590,2006-07,"In a period of 18 months, they had laundered Rs 1,500 crore."
16591,2006-07,"BCTT has also helped the Department to detect bogus bills, accommodation entries, artificial loss claims and dummy firms."
16592,2006-07,I propose to continue the BCTT for some more time until the AIR system is able to capture all significant financial transactions.
16593,2006-07,Fringe Benefit Tax FBT was introduced as a revenue raising measure.
16594,2006-07,FBT can be justified on the principles of horizontal equity and vertical equity.
16595,2006-07,"Nevertheless, I have reviewed it with an open mind."
16596,2006-07,I have also taken on board the views expressed by the apex chambers of commerce.
16597,2006-07,"I propose to make the following changes in chapter XIIH of the Income Tax Act: Value the benefit in the form of ‘tour and travel’ at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent; Value the benefit in the form of ‘hospitality’ and ‘use of hotel boarding and lodging facilities’, in the case of airline companies and shipping industry, at 5 per cent instead of 20 per cent; Exclude the expenses on free samples of medicines and of medical equipment distributed to doctors; Exclude the expenses incurred on brand ambassador and celebrity endorsement; and Prescribe a threshold of Rs 100,000 under section 115WB1c so that only a contribution by an employer to an approved superannuation fund in excess of Rs 100,000 per year per employee will attract FBT."
16598,2006-07,"Under section 80C there is already an exemption up to Rs 100,000 for contribution by an employee to an approved superannuation fund."
16599,2006-07,"Honourable Members will note that, under these two provisions, there can now be a taxexempt contribution up to Rs 200,000 per year for the benefit of an employee."
16600,2006-07,"This allowance, I believe, is generous enough in the case of an overwhelming majority of employees."
16601,2006-07,"With these changes, I am confident that the debate on FBT will draw to a close."
16602,2006-07,Let me remind everyone concerned once again that FBT is justified on the principle of equity.
16603,2006-07,I am glad to inform the House that technology is being increasingly employed to modernize tax administration.
16604,2006-07,The Departments of Income Tax and Customs and Central Excise will undergo Business Process Reengineering BPR.
16605,2006-07,"Nationwide networks will connect 745 income tax offices in 510 cities and 550 customs and central excise offices in 245 cities, creating national databases."
16606,2006-07,"National data centres, data warehousing facilities and disaster recovery sites are being set up."
16607,2006-07,"Jurisdictionfree filing of returns, online tracking of status of accounts and refunds of income tax will be possible."
16608,2006-07,Introduction of a risk management system and Electronic Data Interchange EDI in the Customs Department will reduce dwell time for cargo.
16609,2006-07,Epayments of customs and excise duties will be possible.
16610,2006-07,Both Departments will have fully computerised networks by end 2006.
16611,2006-07,"Our Government’s two Budgets have seen many innovations – the Gender Budget, the Outcome Budget etc."
16612,2006-07,"Today, I place before the House another innovation – a statement on revenue foregone, known worldwide as tax expenditure statement."
16613,2006-07,This statement captures the departures from the normal tax regime.
16614,2006-07,This exercise is a first attempt that will be fine tuned in the years to come.
16615,2006-07,"The House is aware that most States have implemented VAT with effect from April 1, 2005, and the unanimous opinion is that VAT has been a resounding success."
16616,2006-07,"I hope that the nonVAT States will soon join the mainstream, because the next stage of reform depends on all States implementing VAT."
16617,2006-07,"The Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has recommended that Central Sales Tax CST be phased out, and have requested the Centre to compensate them for the expected loss of revenue."
16618,2006-07,"Government has proposed that the loss of revenue may be compensated through monetary and nonmonetary measures which, taken together, will ensure that the States’ revenues remain buoyant."
16619,2006-07,"Once the Empowered Committee and the Government reach an agreement, I shall return to the House with firm proposals, including legislative changes and a supplementary demand."
16620,2006-07,"In the meanwhile, there is an urgent matter connected with CST and VAT which has to be attended to."
16621,2006-07,It has become imperative to moderate the price of Liquified Petroleum Gas LPG for domestic use.
16622,2006-07,States are taxing LPG domestic at high rates.
16623,2006-07,They should also bear a portion of the burden of high prices of petroleum products.
16624,2006-07,"Hence, in order to moderate the price of LPG domestic, I propose to include LPG domestic in the list of ‘declared goods’ under the CST Act. 177."
16625,2006-07,"My tax proposals on direct taxes are estimated to yield a gain of about Rs 4,000 crore."
16626,2006-07,"On the indirect taxes side, the gain is estimated at Rs 2,000 crore."
16627,2006-07,Modernizing Tax Administration XV CONCLUSION 30 178.
16628,2006-07,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe that the world has recognized the potential of India."
16629,2006-07,"It is now for us, the generation to which has been given the privilege of carrying the torch, to rediscover the greatness of this country and the potential of its people."
16630,2006-07,"The young people of India are building castles, it may appear that those castles are in the air, but as Henry David Thoreau said: “If you have built castles in the air, your work need not be lost; that is where they should be."
16631,2006-07,Now put the foundations under them.”
16632,2006-07,It is our duty to put the foundations on which the young can build their castles.
16633,2006-07,The UPA Government has pledged itself to that task.
16634,2006-07,"Over a hundred years ago, a restless young man in his quest for the core of all spirituality admonished his fellow men in the following words: “We reap what we sow."
16635,2006-07,We are the makers of our own fate.
16636,2006-07,"The wind is blowing; those vessels whose sails are unfurled catch it, and go forward on their way, but those which have their sails furled do not catch the wind."
16637,2006-07,Is that the fault of the wind?.......
16638,2006-07,We make our own destiny.”
16639,2006-07,Those are the immortal words of Swami Vivekananda.
16640,2006-07,"Let us believe in our destiny, let us make our future."
16641,2006-07,"Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
16642,2007-08,It is my privilege to present the Budget for 200708.
16643,2007-08,I. A MIDTERM REPORT CARD ON THE ECONOMY 2.
16644,2007-08,"In November 2006, the UPA Government crossed the midpoint of its term of office."
16645,2007-08,A midterm report card can now be presented.
16646,2007-08,"There are many pluses and a few minuses, and I shall deal with both candidly."
16647,2007-08,"The biggest plus is that the growth rate of GDP has improved from 7.5 per cent in 200405 to 9 per cent Quick Estimate in 200506 and, according to Advance Estimate, to 9.2 per cent in 200607."
16648,2007-08,"The average growth rate in the three years of the UPA Government is, therefore, 8.6 per cent."
16649,2007-08,"Thanks to this impressive performance, despite the poor start in 200203, the growth target set for the Tenth Plan of 8 per cent will be nearly achieved."
16650,2007-08,"In the three years of the UPA Government, the growth rate in manufacturing has accelerated from 8.7 per cent to 9.1 per cent and further to 11.3 per cent."
16651,2007-08,"The services sector continues to maintain impressive growth and has recorded, in the three years, a growth rate of 9.6 per cent, 9.8 per cent and 11.2 per cent respectively."
16652,2007-08,"On the other hand, the agriculture sector has witnessed sharp ups and downs."
16653,2007-08,"Average growth during the Tenth Plan period is estimated at 2.3 per cent, which is below the desired level of 4 per cent a year."
16654,2007-08,About 115 million families are classified as farming families.
16655,2007-08,"Furthermore, a country with a large population has to be nearly selfsufficient in essential food items; otherwise supply constraints could upset macro economic stability and growth prospects."
16656,2007-08,"Hence, agriculture must top the agenda of the policy makers and must hold the first charge on our resources."
16657,2007-08,"In a short while, I shall place before this House a number of proposals in this regard."
16658,2007-08,Income and Savings 2 5.
16659,2007-08,"To continue with the report card, per capita income in 200506, in real terms, increased by 7.4 per cent, and the savings rate has been estimated at 32.4 per cent and the investment rate at 33.8 per cent."
16660,2007-08,"Intuitively, I believe that these high rates have continued in the current year too."
16661,2007-08,"The UPA Government has remained committed to economic reforms, fiscal prudence and monetary stability."
16662,2007-08,"We have garnered additional revenues and, as Honourable Members will notice presently, I have put these revenues to good use to promote inclusive growth, equity and social justice  goals that are at the core of the National Common Minimum Programme NCMP and close to the hearts of the UPA, its Chairperson and the Prime Minister."
16663,2007-08,"Until February 2, 2007, bank credit, year on year, had grown by 29.6 per cent."
16664,2007-08,Money supply M3 had expanded by 21.3 per cent.
16665,2007-08,Foreign exchange reserves stood at US$ 180 billion.
16666,2007-08,"While these are concomitant features of high growth, it cannot be denied that these monetary trends have put pressure on prices."
16667,2007-08,Global commodity prices have also exerted pressure on domestic prices.
16668,2007-08,"At the same time, supply constraints have emerged in some essential commodities such as wheat, pulses and edible oils."
16669,2007-08,"Consequently, average inflation in 200607 is estimated at between 5.2 and 5.4 per cent, which is higher than 4.4 per cent last year."
16670,2007-08,I wish to reiterate Government's concern over inflation.
16671,2007-08,"Government has already taken a number of measures on the fiscal, monetary and supply sides to maintain price stability and, if required, will not hesitate to take moremeasures."
16672,2007-08,"WhentheUPAGovernmentassumedofficein2004,theinflation graph was on the rise; but we succeeded in moderating inflation and we are confident that we can moderate the present inflationary trend too."
16673,2007-08,BHARAT NIRMAN AND THE FLAGSHIP PROGRAMMES9.
16674,2007-08,Bharat Nirman remains the cornerstone of the Government's policy.
16675,2007-08,"I am glad to report that in the current financial year: Additional irrigation potential of 2,400,000 hectares, including 900,000 hectares under AIBP, will be created; Drinking water has been provided to 55,512 habitations until December 2006 against a target of 73,120 habitations; Until December 2006, 12,198 kilometres of rural roads have been completed."
16676,2007-08,"The separate window under RIDF will augment funds for the programme by Rs 4,000 crore a year; 783,000 rural houses have been constructed up to December 2006 and 914,000 houses are under construction, and the annual target of 1,500,000 houses is likely to be exceeded; 3 • 19,758 villages have been covered so far under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana; • 15,054 villages have been provided with a telephone against the target of 20,000 villages, and the balance will be covered by the end of the year; Honourable Members will note that Bharat Nirman continues to make impressive progress."
16677,2007-08,The eight flagship programmes of the UPA Government will continue to receive high priority.
16678,2007-08,"Presently, I shall refer to these programmes in some detail."
16679,2007-08,HERALDING THE ELEVENTH FIVE YEAR PLAN 11.
16680,2007-08,The year 200708 will mark the beginning of the Eleventh Plan.
16681,2007-08,"The declared objective is ""Faster and More Inclusive Growth""."
16682,2007-08,"I can state with confidence that, on the eve of the Plan, the economy is in a stronger position than ever before."
16683,2007-08,It therefore behoves us to set higher goals.
16684,2007-08,"The Approach Paper to the Eleventh Plan states that the Plan ""will aim at putting the economy on a sustainable growth trajectory with a growth rate of approximately 10 per cent by the end of its period."""
16685,2007-08,"Among the other objectives of the Plan are growth of 4 per cent in the agriculture sector, faster employment creation, reducing disparities across regions and ensuring access to basic physical infrastructure as well as health and education services to all."
16686,2007-08,I have kept these objectives in mind while allocating resources to various sectors.
16687,2007-08,"Notwithstanding some constraints, I propose to increase substantially the Gross Budgetary Support GBS for the Plan."
16688,2007-08,"In 200607, the GBS was fixed at Rs 172,728 crore and, of this, support to the Central Plan was Rs 131,284 crore."
16689,2007-08,"GBS for 200708 will be increased to Rs 205,100 crore."
16690,2007-08,"Out of this, the Central Plan will receive Rs 154,939 crore."
16691,2007-08,Allocations for Major Sectors 13.
16692,2007-08,"For Bharat Nirman, as against Rs 18,696 crore including the NER component in 200607, I propose to provide Rs 24,603 crore in 200708, which marks an increase of 31.6 per cent."
16693,2007-08,The education and health sectors will also receive substantial funds.
16694,2007-08,"In 200708, I propose to enhance the allocation for education by 34.2 per cent to Rs 32,352 crore and for health and family welfare by 21.9 per cent to Rs 15,291 crore."
16695,2007-08,Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan and Midday Meal Scheme 15.
16696,2007-08,"In allocating resources, school education must have primacy."
16697,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to increase the allocation for school education by about 35 per cent from Rs 17,133 crore in 200607 to Rs 23,142 crore in 200708."
16698,2007-08,"Out of this amount, Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan SSA will be provided Rs 10,671 crore."
16699,2007-08,"Further, I propose to increase the provision for strengthening 4 teachers training institutions from Rs 162 crore to Rs 450 crore."

16704,2007-08,"As more students complete upper primary classes, it is necessary to increase access to secondary education."
16705,2007-08,"Schemes for this purpose are under formulation, and I propose to double the provision for secondary education from Rs 1,837 crore in 200607 to Rs 3,794 crore in 200708."
16706,2007-08,"While the SSA has improved the enrolment ratio in schools to 96 per cent, the drop out ratio continues to be high."
16707,2007-08,The critical year appears to be transition from class VIII to class IX.
16708,2007-08,"In order to arrest the drop out ratio and encourage students to continue their education beyond class VIII, I propose to introduce a National MeanscumMerit Scholarship Scheme."
16709,2007-08,Selection will be made through a national test from among students who have passed class VIII.
16710,2007-08,"Each student will be given Rs 6,000 per year for study in classes IX, X, XI and XII."
16711,2007-08,"I propose that 100,000 scholarships may be awarded every year."
16712,2007-08,"In order to fund this programme, I intend to create a corpus fund of Rs 750 crore this year, and add a like amount to the fund every year over the next three years."
16713,2007-08,"Accordingly, a sum of Rs 750 crore will be placed with the State Bank of India, and the yield from the fund will be used for awarding the scholarships."

16729,2007-08,Government has brought HIV/AIDS out of the closet and promised bold and determined efforts to achieve zerolevel growth of the disease.
16730,2007-08,The epidemic will be deemed 'stabilised' if the prevalence rate is less than one per cent of the population.
16731,2007-08,"National Aids Control Programme NACPIII, starting in 200708 and building on NACPI and NACPII, will target the high risk groups in all the States."

16736,2007-08,"Last year, I had expressed the hope that polio will be eliminated from the country by December 2007."

16738,2007-08,The strategy for polio eradication has been revised.
16739,2007-08,"The number of polio rounds will be increased, monovalent vaccine will be introduced, and there will be intensive coverage in the 20 high risk districts of Uttar Pradesh and 10 districts of Bihar."

16747,2007-08,National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme 28.

16749,2007-08,The pace of implementation varies from State to State.
16750,2007-08,"Since NREGS is a demanddriven scheme carrying a legal guarantee of employment, the budget allocation would have to be supplemented according to 6 need."
16751,2007-08,"I therefore propose to make an initial allocation of Rs 12,000 crore including NER component for NREGS."
16752,2007-08,I am also happy to announce that NREGS will be expanded from the current level of 200 districts to 330 districts.

16767,2007-08,The allocation in 200708 for SCs and STs has been substantially enhanced.
16768,2007-08,"In respect of schemes benefiting only SCs and STs, I have increased the allocation to Rs 3,271 crore."
16769,2007-08,"In respect of schemes with at least 20 per cent of the benefits earmarked for SCs and STs, I have increased the allocation to Rs 17,691 crore."

16773,2007-08,I propose to increase the provision for these scholarships from Rs 440 crore in 7 200607 to Rs 611 crore in 200708.
16774,2007-08,I also propose to make a separate provision of Rs 91 crore for similar scholarships to be awarded to students belonging to socially and educationally backward classes.
16775,2007-08,"Last year, I made a modest contribution of Rs 16.47 crore to the equity of the National Minorities Development and Finance Corporation NMDFC."
16776,2007-08,"Following the Sachar Committee report, NMDFC would be required to expand its reach and intensify its efforts."
16777,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to provide a further sum of Rs 63 crore to the share capital of NMDFC."

16783,2007-08,There is growing awareness of gender sensitivities of budgetary allocations.
16784,2007-08,"For 200708, 27 ministries/departments and 5 Union Territories covering 33 demands for grants have contributed to a statement placed in the budget papers."
16785,2007-08,"The outlay for 100 per cent women specific programmes is Rs 8,795 crore and for schemes where at least 30 per cent is for women specific programmes is Rs 22,382 crore."

16787,2007-08,North Eastern Region NER 40.
16788,2007-08,"The total budget allocation in 200708 for the North Eastern Region, culled out from allocations under different ministries/ departments, has increased from Rs 12,041 crore in 200607 to Rs 14,365 crore in 200708."

16793,2007-08,"In consultation with the Planning Commission, I have also drawn up Plan 'B'."
16794,2007-08,"Since the Eleventh Plan will begin on April 1, 2007, we recognize that there will be a need to take new initiatives in critical areas."
16795,2007-08,Additional resources will be needed once the proposals are finalised and the pace of expenditure builds up.
16796,2007-08,"Therefore, I shall endeavour to find additional resources through better tax administration to the extent of 8 Rs 7,000 crore during the course of the year."
16797,2007-08,"I have been advised by the Planning Commission that these additional funds, once voted by this House, will be allocated among sectors such as agriculture, rural development, health, women and child development, urban infrastructure, water resources, etc. 42."
16798,2007-08,I also have Plan 'C'.
16799,2007-08,"Under Plan 'C', I propose to tap into resources available outside the Budget and leverage them for the purpose of investment, especially in the infrastructure sector."
16800,2007-08,I shall deal with this subject a little later.
16801,2007-08,I shall now take up our main challenge: agriculture.
16802,2007-08,"I may recall the words of Jawaharlal Nehru, who said ""Everything else can wait, but not agriculture""."
16803,2007-08,The draft National Policy for Farmers submitted by the National Commission on Farmers is under consideration.
16804,2007-08,"Meanwhile, I have a number of proposals to improve the economic viability of farming and ensure that farmers earn a minimum net income."
16805,2007-08,Farm credit continues to grow at a satisfactory pace.
16806,2007-08,The goal of doubling farm credit in three years was achieved in two years.
16807,2007-08,"The target of Rs 175,000 crore set for 200607 will be exceeded comfortably and is likely to reach Rs 190,000 crore."
16808,2007-08,"This year, until December 2006, 53.37 lakh new farmers were brought into the institutional credit system."
16809,2007-08,"For 200708, I propose to fix a target of Rs 225,000 crore as farm credit and an addition of 50 lakh new farmers to the banking system."
16810,2007-08,"The two per cent interest subvention scheme for shortterm crop loans will continue in 200708, and I am making a provision of Rs 1,677 crore for that purpose."
16811,2007-08,"A special plan is being implemented over a period of three years in 31 especially distressed districts in four States of the country involving a total amount of Rs 16,979 crore."

16813,2007-08,"In order to provide subsidiary income to the farmer, the special plan includes a scheme for induction of high yielding milch animals and related activities."
16814,2007-08,I propose to provide Rs 153 crore for this scheme.
16815,2007-08,Government had appointed a Committee under Dr. R. Radhakrishna to examine all aspects of agricultural indebtedness.
16816,2007-08,The Committee has held wide ranging consultations across the country and is in the process of finalising its recommendations.
16817,2007-08,Government will act on the report as soon as it is received.
16818,2007-08,A Mission for Pulses 49.
16819,2007-08,Government is concerned about the stagnation in the production and productivity of pulses.
16820,2007-08,A critical deficiency is the availability and quality of certified seeds.
16821,2007-08,"I therefore propose to expand the Integrated Oilseeds, Oil palm, 9 Pulses and Maize Development programme."
16822,2007-08,"There will be a sharper focus on scaling up the production of breeder, foundation and certified seeds."
16823,2007-08,"The Indian Institute of Pulses Research IIPR, Kanpur, the National and State level seeds corporations, agricultural universities, ICAR centres, KRIBHCO, IFFCO and NAFED as well as large private sector companies will be invited to submit plans to scale up the production of seeds."
16824,2007-08,"Government will fund the expansion of IIPR, Kanpur, and offer the other producers a capital grant or concessional financing in order to double the production of certified seeds within a period of three years."
16825,2007-08,A Special Purpose Tea Fund has been launched for replantation and rejuvenation of tea.

16829,2007-08,"As against an outlay of Rs 7,121 crore in 200607, the outlay for 200708 will be increased to Rs 11,000 crore."
16830,2007-08,"Of this, the grant component to State Governments will be Rs 3,580 crore, an increase from Rs 2,350 crore."
16831,2007-08,Rainfed Area Development Programme 52.
16832,2007-08,The National Rainfed Area Authority was established a few months ago to coordinate all schemes relating to watershed development and other aspects of land use.
16833,2007-08,I propose to allocate Rs 100 crore for the new Rainfed Area Development Programme.
16834,2007-08,Water Resources Management: Restoring Water Bodies 53.
16835,2007-08,"Honourable Members will recall that, in March 2005, a pilot project to repair, renovate and restore water bodies was launched in 13 States."
16836,2007-08,"I am happy to inform the House that the World Bank has signed a loan agreement with Tamil Nadu for Rs 2,182 crore to restore 5,763 water bodies having a command area of 400,000 hectares."
16837,2007-08,"An agreement for Andhra Pradesh is expected to be concluded in March 2007 and will cover 3,000 water bodies with a command area of 250,000 hectares."
16838,2007-08,"Preparation of similar projects for Karnataka, Orissa and West Bengal are at different stages and at least two more agreements are likely to be concluded before June 2007."
16839,2007-08,I would urge other State Governments to come forward with proposals so that the whole country can be covered within the next two years.
16840,2007-08,Depletion of ground water has assumed grave proportions.
16841,2007-08,"The Central Ground Water Board has identified 1,065 assessment blocks in the country as 'overexploited' or 'critical'."
16842,2007-08,Over 80 per cent of these blocks are in 100 districts in seven States.
16843,2007-08,The strategy for ground water recharge is to divert rain water 10 into 'dug wells'.
16844,2007-08,"Each structure will cost about Rs 4,000."
16845,2007-08,"The requirement is seven million structures, including about two million structures on land belonging to small and marginal farmers."
16846,2007-08,I propose to provide 100 per cent subsidy to small and marginal farmers and 50 per cent subsidy to other farmers.
16847,2007-08,Ministry of Water Resources will finalise the scheme shortly.
16848,2007-08,"In anticipation, I intend to transfer a sum of Rs 1,800 crore to NABARD."
16849,2007-08,The amount will be held in escrow and will be disbursed through the lead bank of the district concerned to the beneficiaries.
16850,2007-08,"With minimum instruction and training, our farmers will easily absorb good water management practices."
16851,2007-08,I therefore propose that the Indian Council of Agricultural Research ICAR may set up one teachingcumdemonstration model of water harvesting in each of 32 selected State Agricultural Universities and ICAR institutes.
16852,2007-08,"Each institution will train 100 trainers and 1,000 farmers every year in twoweek and oneweek programmes respectively."
16853,2007-08,"Based on estimates of recurring costs, I intend to provide an interest free loan of Rs 3 crore to each institution to create a corpus fund."
16854,2007-08,The yield from the fund will be used for implementing the training programme.
16855,2007-08,The total cost is estimated at Rs 100 crore.
16856,2007-08,"The green revolution of the 1960s was brought about by thousands of agricultural extension workers who worked side by side with our farmers under a programme called Training and Visit T&V. Sadly, the extension system seems to have collapsed."
16857,2007-08,"In order to revive extension work, the Ministry of Agriculture will, in consultation with State Governments, draw up a new programme that will replicate T&V with suitable changes."
16858,2007-08,The Agriculture Technology Management Agency ATMA that is now in place in 262 districts will be extended to another 300 districts in 200708.
16859,2007-08,I propose to enhance the provision for ATMA from Rs 50 crore to Rs 230 crore next year.
16860,2007-08,"I had budgeted Rs 17,253 crore for fertiliser subsidies in 200607."
16861,2007-08,"According to Revised Estimates, this will rise to Rs 22,452 crore, and there is a demand for more money."
16862,2007-08,"While fertilisers should indeed be subsidised, we must find an alternative method of delivering the subsidy directly to the farmer."
16863,2007-08,The fertiliser industry has agreed to work with the Department of Fertilisers to conduct a study and find a solution.
16864,2007-08,"Based on the report, Government intends to implement a pilot programme in at least one district in each State in 200708."
16865,2007-08,The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme NAIS will be continued in its present form for Kharif and Rabi 200708.
16866,2007-08,I propose to make a provision of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.
16867,2007-08,Agricultural Insurance Corporation AIC has been running a pilot weather insurance scheme since Kharif 2004 and it appears to be a more promising risk mitigation scheme.
16868,2007-08,"Hence, Government will ask AIC to start a weather based crop insurance scheme on a pilot basis in two or three States, in consultation with the State Governments concerned, as an alternative to the NAIS."
16869,2007-08,The scheme will be operated on an actuarial basis with an element of subsidy.
16870,2007-08,I intend to allocate Rs 100 crore for this purpose in 200708.
16871,2007-08,National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development NABARD 61.
16872,2007-08,NABARD provides refinance to cooperative institutions.
16873,2007-08,"As the volume of farm credit increases and the Vaidyanathan Committee recommendations for reform of rural credit cooperatives are implemented, the demand for refinance will increase."
16874,2007-08,"In order to augment its resources, I propose to allow NABARD to issue rural bonds to the extent of Rs 5,000 crore."
16875,2007-08,These bonds will be guaranteed by the Government and will be eligible for suitable tax exemption.
16876,2007-08,Rural Infrastructure Development Fund 62.
16877,2007-08,The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF continues to sanction and disburse funds to State Governments.
16878,2007-08,"In 200607, out of a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore, NABARD has so far issued sanctions for Rs 8,440 crore and will achieve its target."
16879,2007-08,"Keeping in view the growing demand for these funds, I propose to raise the corpus of RIDFXIII in 200708 to Rs 12,000 crore."
16880,2007-08,I would urge State Governments to use these funds primarily in the distressed districts of the State.
16881,2007-08,"A separate window for rural roads under RIDF was opened with Rs 4,000 crore."
16882,2007-08,"Against this, projects for Rs 2,311 crore have been sanctioned in 200607."
16883,2007-08,"I propose to continue the separate window under RIDFXIII in 200708 with a corpus of Rs 4,000 crore."
16884,2007-08,One of the commitments made in the NCMP is that Government will introduce a social security scheme for unorganised workers.
16885,2007-08,A committee chaired by Dr. Arjun Sengupta has given its report which is under consideration.
16886,2007-08,"Pending a decision, in order to signal the UPA Government's concern for the welfare of unorganised workers, I propose to make a beginning."
16887,2007-08,I propose to extend death and disability insurance cover through Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC to rural landless households under a new scheme called 'Aam Admi Bima Yojana' AABY.
16888,2007-08,"According to NSS Report No. 491, the estimate of such households is about 1.5 crore."
16889,2007-08,"By end March 2007, 70 lakh households will be covered through existing schemes of the LIC with the support of some State Governments and the social security fund with the LIC."
16890,2007-08,"Under AABY, I propose to cover the rural landless households which enjoy no cover at all today, and the number may be actually more than what is indicated in the NSS report."
16891,2007-08,The head of the family or one earning member in the family will be insured.
16892,2007-08,The Central Government will bear 50 per cent of the premium of Rs 200 per year per person and I would urge the State Governments to come forward to bear the other 50 per cent on behalf of the beneficiaries.
16893,2007-08,"Taking into account the annual cost to the Central 12 Government, I intend to place a sum of Rs 1,000 crore in a fund that will be maintained by LIC."
16894,2007-08,I propose to finalise the scheme in consultation with State Governments and begin to implement it in 200708.
16895,2007-08,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, I have devoted the last 15 minutes or so to agriculture."
16896,2007-08,There is no dearth of schemes; there is no dearth of funds.
16897,2007-08,What needs to be done is to deliver the intended outcomes.
16898,2007-08,Saint Tiruvalluvar watches over us and warns: “Uzhavinar Kai Madangin Illai Vizhaivathoom Vittame Enbarkum Nilai”[If ploughmen keep their hands foldedEven sages claiming renunciation cannot find salvation] V. INVESTMENT 66.

16900,2007-08,"For example, gross domestic capital formation GDCF in 200506 grew by 23.7 per cent over the previous year to Rs 11,47,254 crore."
16901,2007-08,I believe that this trend continues in 200607.

16904,2007-08,"Government will provide equity support of Rs 16,361 crore and loans of Rs 2,970 crore to CPSEs."
16905,2007-08,"Further, in the current year, we have restructured eight CPSEs with a cash infusion of Rs 1,590 crore and noncash sacrifices of Rs 1,612 crore."
16906,2007-08,Electricity generation has recorded a growth rate of 7.5 per cent in April December this year.
16907,2007-08,"However, as we complete the Tenth Plan, we would have added only 23,163 MW of additional capacity in the five year period including 16,339 MW added in the three years beginning 200405."
16908,2007-08,"Hence, it is imperative that we take new initiatives."
16909,2007-08,The Ministry of Power has awarded two Ultra Mega Power Projects UMPP in Sasan and Mundra.
16910,2007-08,"Seven more UMPPs are under process and we are confident that at least two more will be awarded by July, 2007."
16911,2007-08,Other initiatives taken by the Ministry of Power include facilitating setting up of merchant power plants by private developers and private participation in transmission projects.
16912,2007-08,"Besides, the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Project APDRP has reduced significantly Aggregate Technical and Commercial ATC losses in 213 towns."
16913,2007-08,"APDRP is being restructured to cover all district headquarters 13 and towns with a population of more than 50,000."
16914,2007-08,I propose to increase the budgetary support for APDRP from Rs 650 crore in 200607 to Rs 800 crore next year.
16915,2007-08,"Having regard to the pace of implementation under the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana and the annual target, I propose to increase the allocation from Rs 3,000 crore in 200607 to Rs 3,983 crore in 200708."
16916,2007-08,"Following the announcement last year, 26 coal blocks with reserves of 8,581 million tonnes and four lignite blocks with reserves of 755 million tonnes have been allotted, up to December 2006, to Government companies and approved end users."

16920,2007-08,"So far, National Highways Authority of India NHAI has given Rs 2,072 crore as viability gap funding but has also received Rs 1,900 crore as negative grant."

16927,2007-08,The Public Private Partnership PPP model has enabled greater private sector participation in the creation and maintenance of infrastructure.
16928,2007-08,"So far, under the viability gap funding scheme, 37 proposals have been received of which 21 proposals have been granted 'inprinciple' approval with a total project cost of Rs 9,842 crore and an estimated viability gap funding of Rs 2,521 crore."
16929,2007-08,"The pace is slow, and there is a need to adopt a more aggressive approach for preparing a shelf of bankable projects that can be offered for competitive bidding."
16930,2007-08,"Apart from the steps already taken for capacity building and engaging consultants, I intend to set up a revolving fund with a corpus of Rs 100 crore to quicken project preparation."
16931,2007-08,The fund will contribute up to 75 per cent of the preparatory expenditure in the form of interest free loan that will be eventually recovered from the successful bidder.

17020,2007-08,Revised courses in the first lot of 100 upgraded ITIs were started in August 2005 and in the second lot of 100 upgraded ITIs in August 2006.
17021,2007-08,I expect that another 300 ITIs will be covered by August 2009.
17022,2007-08,"That would still leave 1,396 Government ITIs."
17023,2007-08,"I propose that the 1,396 ITIs be upgraded into centres of excellence in specific trades and skills under publicprivate partnership."
17024,2007-08,"Under the proposed scheme, the State Government, as the owner of the ITI, will continue to regulate admissions and fees; the new management will be given academic and financial 19 autonomy; and the Central Government will provide financial assistance by way of seed money."
17025,2007-08,ITIs will be encouraged to start a second shift.
17026,2007-08,"Once a tripartite MoU is signed among the three stakeholders, I propose to grant an interest free loan up to Rs 2.5 crore to each ITI for upgradation and revision of courses."

17033,2007-08,"Under the scheme, Government will reimburse the employer's contribution to the EPF and ESI for the first three years."

17046,2007-08,"India is not a significant contributor to green house gas GHG emissions, nor will it be so in the foreseeable future."

17127,2007-08,"However, there is no reason to allow the exemption to other private importers."
17128,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to levy an import duty of 3 per cent, which is the WTO bound rate, on all private import of aircraft including helicopters."
17129,2007-08,Such import will also attract countervailing duty and additional customs duty.
17130,2007-08,The Hoda Committee has submitted a report on mineral policy.
17131,2007-08,"Taking a leaf out of the report, and in order to conserve our natural resources as well as to raise revenue, I propose to impose an export duty of Rs 300 per metric tonne on export of iron ores and concentrates and Rs 2,000 per metric tonne on export of chrome ores and concentrates."
17132,2007-08,I shall now turn to my proposals on excise duties and service tax.
17133,2007-08,There will be no change in the general CENVAT rate or in the service tax rate.
17134,2007-08,"On February 15, 2007, Government reduced the price of petrol and diesel by Rs 2 per litre and Re.1 per litre, respectively."
17135,2007-08,I had agreed that the Revenue will bear a part of the burden.
17136,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to reduce the ad valorem component of excise duty on petrol and diesel from 8 per cent to 6 per cent."
17137,2007-08,"Keeping in mind the special needs of several sectors and the interest of the consumers, I propose to grant relief from excise duty in deserving cases, especially job creating sectors: I propose to raise the exemption limit for small scale industry SSI from Rs 1 crore to Rs 1.5 crore."
17138,2007-08,The food processing sector is poised to achieve high growth.

17142,2007-08,I can no longer be accused of being partial to idli and dosa mixes.

17150,2007-08,I propose to extend the exemption to all pipes of diameter exceeding 200 mm used in water supply systems.
17151,2007-08,There has been a significant increase in the retail price of cement.
17152,2007-08,"Last year, at this time, a bag of 50 kilogram was sold at a Maximum Retail Price MRP of Rs 190 or less which, I understand, is a remunerative price."
17153,2007-08,I propose to reward cement manufacturers who hold the price line and tax those who do not.
17154,2007-08,"Accordingly, I propose to reduce the present rate of excise duty of Rs 400 per metric tonne to Rs 350 per metric tonne on cement which is sold in retail at not more than Rs 190 per bag."
17155,2007-08,"On cement that has a higher MRP, the excise duty will be Rs 600 per metric tonne."
17156,2007-08,"I strongly support the campaign ""say no to tobacco""."
17157,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to increase the specific rates of excise duty on cigarettes by about 5 per cent."
17158,2007-08,"Similarly, excise duty excluding cess on biris, which was last fixed in 2001, 25 will be raised from Rs 7 to Rs 11 per thousand for nonmachine made biris and from Rs 17 to Rs 24 per thousand for machine made biris."
17159,2007-08,There is an exemption from excise duty for unbranded biris up to 20 lakh biris in a year.
17160,2007-08,Complaints have been received of misuse of the exemption.
17161,2007-08,This exemption will henceforth be available subject to fulfilment of the condition of declaration with the Department of Central Excise and regular monitoring.
17162,2007-08,Pan masala containing tobacco will continue to bear an excise duty of 66 per cent.
17163,2007-08,"However, in the case of pan masala not containing tobacco, the duty will be reduced from 66 per cent to 45 per cent."
17164,2007-08,I also propose to withdraw the exemption for pan masala containing tobacco and other tobacco products that is now given to units in the North Eastern States.
17165,2007-08,"Based on a comprehensive review of exemptions and having posted them on the website and having invited comments, I propose to remove certain excise duty exemptions which are redundant or have outlived their utility."
17166,2007-08,"I propose to raise the exemption limit for small service providers from Rs 400,000 to Rs 800,000."
17167,2007-08,"Consequently, 200,000 assessees out of a total of 400,000 assessees will go out of the service tax net."
17168,2007-08,"The revenue loss will be Rs 800 crore, but I am happy to give away this sum in the interest of the small service provider and the consumer."
17169,2007-08,"While I bid goodbye to 200,000 assessees, I welcome the new assessees who will be brought into the fold."

17171,2007-08,State Governments levy a tax on the transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract.
17172,2007-08,The value of services in a works contract should attract service tax.
17173,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to levy service tax on services involved in the execution of a works contract."
17174,2007-08,"However, I also propose an optional composition scheme under which service tax will be levied at only 2 per cent of the total value of the works contract."
17175,2007-08,I propose to exempt service tax on services provided by Resident Welfare Associations to their members who contribute Rs 3000 or less per month for services rendered.

17179,2007-08,The scope of some services that are currently taxed is being expanded or redefined.
17180,2007-08,"However, I shall not burden the House with the details."
17181,2007-08,"The telecommunications industry has repeatedly requested that the multifarious taxes, charges and fees applicable to the industry should be unified and a single levy on revenue should be collected."
17182,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to request the Department of Telecommunications to constitute a committee to study the present structure of levies and make suitable recommendations to Government."
17183,2007-08,Direct Taxes I shall now move to direct taxes.
17184,2007-08,"In the current year, there has been better tax compliance by individuals."
17185,2007-08,I hope this trend will continue.
17186,2007-08,The current slabs and rates of personal income tax PIT were introduced only two years ago.
17187,2007-08,They constitute a moderate tax regime.
17188,2007-08,A comprehensive review should await the proposed Income Tax code which will be introduced in Parliament this year.
17189,2007-08,"Nevertheless, without altering the rates, I am inclined to consider giving some relief to tax payers, especially in view of the cooperation they have extended to the Department of Revenue."
17190,2007-08,"Accordingly, I propose that: the threshold limit of exemption in the case of all assessees be increased by Rs 10,000, thus giving every assessee a relief of Rs 1,000; consequently, in the case of a woman assessee, the threshold limit be increased from Rs 135,000 to Rs 145,000, giving her a relief of Rs 1,000; the threshold limit of exemption in the case of a senior citizen be increased from Rs 185,000 to Rs 195,000, giving him or her a relief of Rs 2,000; and the deduction in respect of medical insurance premium under section 80D be increased to a maximum of Rs 15,000 and, in the case of a senior citizen, a maximum of Rs 20,000."
17191,2007-08,"On the corporate income tax CIT side too, there has been better compliance."
17192,2007-08,"Consequently, I propose to keep the same rate of CIT with one important modification."
17193,2007-08,"In order to encourage small and medium enterprises to 27 invest and grow, I propose to remove the surcharge on income tax on all firms and companies with a taxable income of Rs 1 crore or less."
17194,2007-08,"This will benefit about 1,200,000 firms and companies."
17195,2007-08,"Profitmaking cooperative banks, other than primary societies and primary banks i.e., PACs and PCARDBs, have been brought on par with other banks."
17196,2007-08,"However, I have noticed some anomalies and I propose to correct them in the interest of the cooperative banks."
17197,2007-08,"Accordingly, the benefit of Section 361viii will be available to cooperative banks."
17198,2007-08,"Likewise, cooperative banks will also be allowed deduction in respect of provision for bad and doubtful debts under section 361viia."
17199,2007-08,Amalgamation and demerger of banking companies is tax neutral and this benefit will be extended to cooperative banks.
17200,2007-08,There are some obvious claimants to this benefit.
17201,2007-08,"One is cross country natural gas distribution network, including gas pipeline and storage facilities integrated to the network."
17202,2007-08,The second is navigation channel in the sea.
17203,2007-08,I propose to extend the tax concession to these two facilities.
17204,2007-08,"In order to facilitate the creation of urban infrastructure, I propose to allow issue of taxfree bonds through State Pooled Finance Entities formed for raising funds for a group of urban local bodies."

17206,2007-08,"Taking into account its recommendations, the best international practices and the need for a simple tax regime, I propose to introduce a benign assessment procedure for assessees engaged in diamond manufacturing and trading who declare profits from such activities at 8 per cent or more of the turnover."
17207,2007-08,Instructions in this regard will issue shortly.
17208,2007-08,"We will require 20,000 more hotel rooms for the Commonwealth Games."
17209,2007-08,"Hence, I propose a five year holiday from income tax for two, three or four star hotels as well as for convention centres with a seating capacity of not less than 3,000."
17210,2007-08,"They should be completed and begin operations in the National Capital Territory of Delhi or in the adjacent districts of Faridabad, Gurgaon, Ghaziabad or Gautam Budh Nagar during the period April 1, 2007 to March 31, 2010."
17211,2007-08,Section 352AB allows a weighted deduction of 150 per cent for expenditure relating to inhouse research and development.

17215,2007-08,Efiling of corporate returns introduced this financial year has been a resounding success.
17216,2007-08,"Until January 31, 2007, 301,736 returns were electronically filed by corporates."
17217,2007-08,"Our analysis shows that the effective rate of tax paid by all corporates, thanks to numerous tax concessions and exemptions  several of them wellintended  was only 19.2 per cent."
17218,2007-08,"In 199697, we introduced the Minimum Alternate Tax MAT for companies with book profits, and its purpose is to bring about horizontal equity in taxation."
17219,2007-08,"MAT should therefore apply, as far as possible, to all corporate incomes."
17220,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to extend MAT to income in respect of which deduction is claimed under sections 10A and 10B of the Income Tax Act."
17221,2007-08,I also propose to partially modify a deduction that is available to certain companies.
17222,2007-08,"Without altering the overall limit of the special reserve equal to twice the net worth under section 361viii of the Income Tax Act, I propose to stretch out the period by restricting the deduction to 20 per cent of the profits each year and limit the benefit to banks and certain financial corporations."
17223,2007-08,"Venture capital funds are a useful source of risk capital, especially for startup ventures in the knowledgeintensive sectors."
17224,2007-08,"Since such funds enjoy a passthrough status, it is necessary to limit the tax benefit to investments made in truly deserving sectors."
17225,2007-08,"Accordingly, I propose to grant passthrough status to venture capital funds only in respect of investments in venture capital undertakings in biotechnology; information technology relating to hardware and software development; nanotechnology; seed research and development; research and development of new chemical entities in the pharmaceutical sector; dairy industry; poultry industry; and production of biofuels."
17226,2007-08,"In order to promote business tourism, I also propose to allow this benefit to venture capital funds that invest in hotelcumconvention centres of a certain description and size."
17227,2007-08,"In December 2006, I put a limit of Rs 50 lakh per investor per year with respect to capital gains bonds issued by NHAI and REC under section 54EC of the Income Tax Act."
17228,2007-08,"As a result, many small investors could obtain these bonds and save on capital gains."
17229,2007-08,"I propose to continue this provision and, accordingly, I propose to amend section 54EC to that effect."
17230,2007-08,I propose to expand the tax base of capital gains to include certain works of art.
17231,2007-08,I believe that my direct tax proposals have brought about more horizontal equity.
17232,2007-08,It is also necessary to improve vertical equity.
17233,2007-08,"Having regard to the capacity to pay, I propose to raise the rate of dividend distribution tax from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent on dividends distributed by companies."
17234,2007-08,Dividends distributed by money market mutual funds and liquid mutual funds enjoy concessional tax rates giving rise to huge arbitrage opportunities.
17235,2007-08,I propose to address this distortion by raising the dividend distribution tax on dividends paid by such entities to 25 per cent for all investors.
17236,2007-08,Fringe Benefit Tax FBT has now stabilized.
17237,2007-08,I have received a few representations regarding some aspects of sales promotion.

17239,2007-08,A number of companies provide fringe benefits to employees through Employees' Stock Option Plan ESOP.
17240,2007-08,I propose to bring ESOPs under FBT.
17241,2007-08,"The value of the fringe benefit will be determined, in accordance with a prescribed method, on the date of exercise of the option."
17242,2007-08,The Banking Cash Transactions Tax BCTT continues to be an extremely useful tool to track unaccounted monies and trace their source and destination.
17243,2007-08,It has led the Income Tax Department to many money laundering and hawala transactions.
17244,2007-08,"Having regard to the experience gained, I propose to exclude cash withdrawals by the Central and State Governments from the scope of BCTT."
17245,2007-08,"Further, I propose to raise the exemption limit for individuals and HUFs from Rs 25,000 to Rs 50,000."
17246,2007-08,"As other instruments become more effective, I think it would be possible to review BCTT next year."
17247,2007-08,I have a proposal regarding the cess for education.
17248,2007-08,"While the cess of 2 per cent on all taxes to fund basic education will remain, I propose to levy an additional cess of 1 per cent on all taxes to fund secondary education and higher education and the expansion of capacity by 54 per cent for reservation for socially and educationally backward classes."
17249,2007-08,"Finally, there is a small matter which has large beneficial consequences."
17250,2007-08,"In 2001, 'Aviation Turbine Fuel sold to turboprop aircraft' was included in the list of declared goods under section 14 of the CST Act."
17251,2007-08,Turboprop aircraft have been replaced by new generation small aircraft which have taken air services to smaller airports and to the remote parts of the country.
17252,2007-08,"Hence, I propose to amend the provision to cover all small aircraft with maximum takeoff mass of less than 40,000 kgs operated by scheduled airlines."
17253,2007-08,"Along with tax reforms, the Government has laid great emphasis on tax administration."
17254,2007-08,The cost of collection of taxes in India is among the lowest in the world.
17255,2007-08,A number of administrative goals have been set for 200708.
17256,2007-08,"These include expanding the coverage of Annual Information Returns, extending the Refund Banker System to more areas, extending the epayment facility through more banks, making electronic filing of returns mandatory for more categories of assessees and creating new Large Tax Payer Units."
17257,2007-08,"My tax proposals on direct taxes are estimated to yield a gain of Rs 3,000 crore."
17258,2007-08,"On the indirect taxes side, the proposals are revenue neutral."
17259,2007-08,XIV. CONCLUSION 30 185.
17260,2007-08,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, our human and gender development indices are low not because of high growth but because growth is not high enough."
17261,2007-08,"Faster economic growth has given us, once again, the opportunity to unfurl the sails and catch the wind."
17262,2007-08,"Without growth, I could not have given a new thrust to agriculture."
17263,2007-08,"I could not have given relief to the small tax payer, the small service provider and to small scale industry."
17264,2007-08,"I could not have promised 100,000 scholarships or 100,000 jobs for the physically challenged."
17265,2007-08,I could not have promised a massive ground water recharge programme or social security for rural landless households.
17266,2007-08,"The UPA Government has delivered on the promise of savings and investment, and will deliver on the promise of encouraging more savings and translating the savings into more investment."
17267,2007-08,"It has delivered on the promise of growth, and will deliver on the promise of making growth more inclusive."
17268,2007-08,"I believe that, given a right mix of policies, the poor will benefit from growth that is driven by savings and investment and that is more inclusive."
17269,2007-08,"As Dr. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel laureate, said, “Faster growth rate is essential for faster reduction in poverty."
17270,2007-08,There is no other trick to it.”
17271,2007-08,"Sir, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
17272,2008-09,I rise to present the Budget for 200809.
17273,2008-09,"This House and the United Progressive Alliance Government have bestowed upon me the honour of presenting all five Budgets on behalf of a Government  a rare honour that I have the privilege to share with only one of my distinguished predecessors, Dr. Manmohan Singh."
17274,2008-09,I. THE ECONOMY: AN OVERVIEW2.
17275,2008-09,"The India growth story, so far, has been an absorbing and inspiring tale."
17276,2008-09,"Beginning January 1, 2005, the economy has recorded a growth rate of over 8 per cent in 12 successive quarters up to December 31, 2007."
17277,2008-09,"In the first three years of the UPA Government, the Gross Domestic Product GDP increased by 7.5 per cent, 9.4 per cent and 9.6 per cent, resulting in an unprecedented average growth rate of 8.8 per cent."
17278,2008-09,"In the current year too, according to the Advance Estimates by the Central Statistical Organisation CSO, the growth rate will be 8.7 per cent  although I am confident that we will maintain the average of 8.8 per cent."
17279,2008-09,"The drivers of growth continue to be ""services"" and ""manufacturing"", which are estimated to grow at 10.7 per cent and 9.4 per cent, respectively.3."
17280,2008-09,"Nevertheless, 200708 has been the most challenging of the last four years."
17281,2008-09,"At the beginning of the year, the outlook for the global economy was benign."
17282,2008-09,"Our economy, thanks to our own policies as well as globalisation, was poised to record another year of high growth: in fact, the first half of 200708 returned a growth of 9.1 per cent."
17283,2008-09,"However, since August 2007, the financial markets in the developed countries have witnessed considerable turbulence that has not yet abated."
17284,2008-09,The consequences for developing countries are also not yet clear.4.
17285,2008-09,"Moreover, agriculture has struck a disappointing note."
17286,2008-09,"Despite a fine start in the first half of 200708, the growth rate for the whole year in agriculture is estimated at only 2.6 per cent.5."
17287,2008-09,There are other downside risks too.
17288,2008-09,"World prices of crude oil, commodities and food grains have risen sharply in the period April 2007 to January 2008."
17289,2008-09,The position of crude oil is well known to this House.
17290,2008-09,"Among commodities, the prices of iron ore, copper, lead, tin, urea etc are elevated."
17291,2008-09,"The prices of wheat and rice have increased in the world market by 88 per cent and 15 per cent, respectively."
17292,2008-09,"All these trends are inflationary, and there is pressure on domestic prices, especially on the prices of food articles."
17293,2008-09,"Consequently, the management of the supply side of food articles will be the most crucial task in the ensuing year.6."
17294,2008-09,We have also witnessed capital inflows that are far in excess of the current account deficit.
17295,2008-09,This poses a challenge to monetary management.
17296,2008-09,The solution lies in increasing the absorptive capacity of the economy in the medium term.
17297,2008-09,"In the short term, it is our responsibility to manage the flows more actively."
17298,2008-09,"Government will, in consultation with the RBI, continue to monitor the situation closely and take such temporary measures as may be necessary to moderate the capital flows consistent with the objective of monetary and financial stability.7."
17299,2008-09,Keeping inflation under check is one of the cornerstones of our policy.
17300,2008-09,"Recently, the Prime Minister declared, ""I think no Government in our country can be oblivious to the objective of ensuring reasonable price stability without hurting the growth process."""
17301,2008-09,There can be no clearer enunciation of policy.
17302,2008-09,"However, since the downside risks have increased worldwide, we must be vigilant and prepared to make swift adjustments in our policies to achieve the goal of growth with price stability.8."
17303,2008-09,"Let me first deal with agriculture, briefly for the present, and at some length later."
17304,2008-09,The Ministry of Agriculture has estimated that the total output of food grains in 200708 will be 219.32 million tonnes and that will be an all time record.
17305,2008-09,"In particular, production of rice is estimated at 94.08 million tonnes; maize at 16.78 million tonnes; soya bean at 9.45 million tonnes; and cotton at 23.38 million bales of 170 kg each  and each of these will be an all time record."
17306,2008-09,"Government is conscious that while a lot has been done, a lot more needs to be done."
17307,2008-09,"Since the last Budget, Government has formulated and announced the National Policy for Farmers."
17308,2008-09,"Besides, Government has launched the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana with an outlay of Rs 25,000 crore and the National Food Security Mission with an outlay of Rs 4,882 crore."
17309,2008-09,Both schemes will be implemented during the Eleventh Five Year Plan period.
17310,2008-09,We are determined to become selfsufficient in food grains.
17311,2008-09,"Presently, I shall place before this House a number of new initiatives in the agriculture sector."
17312,2008-09,The Growth Story: Faster and more inclusive9.
17313,2008-09,"To return to the India growth story, I am of the firm belief that we owe our sustained progress to the policy of economic reforms first ushered in by a Congress Government and now carried forward by the UPA Government.10."
17314,2008-09,"If 1984 and 1991 were turning points in the history of India's economy, 2004 was another turning point."
17315,2008-09,"Confident that high growth was sustainable, the UPA Government had declared in the National Common Minimum Programme its intention to make growth more inclusive."
17316,2008-09,"Sir, I ask this House, respectfully, to judge our record on inclusive growth from the following sample of facts:• agricultural credit doubled in the first two years of this Government and is poised to reach a level of Rs 240,000 crore by March 2008.• the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has proved to be a historic measure of empowerment of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and, especially, of women.• the Mid Day Meal Scheme is the largest school lunch programme in the world covering 11.4 crore children.•"

17415,2008-09,"The North Eastern Region and, especially, Arunachal Pradesh and the border areas face special problems that cannot be tackled in the usual course or through normal schemes."
17416,2008-09,"Hence, Government proposes to identify the urgent needs of these areas and address them through a special mechanism."

17436,2008-09,Four more ministries/departments have set up gender budgeting cells taking the total number to 54.

17445,2008-09,"Considering the fact that there are over 30 lakh SHGs creditlinked to banks, I propose to single out this category for special attention."
17446,2008-09,I propose to ask LIC to rapidly scale up the scheme and cover all women SHGs that are creditlinked to banks.
17447,2008-09,"Since onehalf of the premium is subsidized through the Social Security Fund, I propose to contribute Rs 500 crore to the corpus of the fund with the assurance that annual contributions will be made as the scheme is scaled up."

17464,2008-09,Gross Capital Formation GCF in agriculture as a proportion of GDP in the agriculture sector has improved from a low of 10.2 per cent in 200304 to 12.5 per cent in 200607.
17465,2008-09,"This, however, needs to be raised to 16 per cent during the Eleventh Plan to achieve the target growth rate of 4 per cent."
17466,2008-09,Government is investing heavily in the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme AIBP and the Rainfed Area Development Programme and in the management and augmentation of water resources.

17477,2008-09,Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation63.
17478,2008-09,"While these ongoing programmes will raise the level of investment in agriculture, I think that we need an ambitious scheme of a much larger proportion."
17479,2008-09,Government is of the view that massive investments are required to be made in irrigation projects.
17480,2008-09,"Recently, Government has approved 14 projects that satisfy certain criteria as national projects and three of them alone would require Rs 7,000 crore during the Eleventh Plan period."
17481,2008-09,"Having regard to the magnitude of the challenge, I propose to establish the Irrigation and Water Resources Finance Corporation IWRFC with an initial capital of Rs 100 crore contributed by the Central Government."
17482,2008-09,State Governments and other financial institutions will be invited to contribute to the equity.

17500,2008-09,"In addition, the Weather Based Crop Insurance Scheme that is being implemented as a pilot scheme in selected areas of five States will be continued."

17506,2008-09,I am happy to report that the Central Government and the State Governments have reached an agreement on the content of the package to implement the Prof. Vaidyanathan Committee's report on reviving the longterm cooperative credit structure.
17507,2008-09,"The cost of the package is estimated at Rs 3,074 crore, of which the Central Government's share will be Rs 2,642 crore or 86 per cent of the total burden."
17508,2008-09,Debt Waiver and Debt Relief73.
17509,2008-09,"Sir, while I am confident that the schemes and measures that I have listed above will give a boost to the agriculture sector, the question that still looms large is what we should do about the indebtedness of farmers."
17510,2008-09,Honourable members will recall that Government had appointed a Committee under Dr. R. Radhakrishna to examine all aspects of agricultural indebtedness.
17511,2008-09,The Committee has since submitted its report and it is in the public domain.
17512,2008-09,The Committee had made a number of recommendations but stopped short of recommending waiver of agricultural loans.
17513,2008-09,"However, Government is conscious of the dimensions of the problem and is sensitive to the difficulties of the farming community, especially the small and marginal farmers."
17514,2008-09,"Having carefully weighed the pros and cons of debt waiver and having taken into account the resource position, I place before this House a scheme of debt waiver and debt relief for farmers:i All agricultural loans disbursed by scheduled commercial banks, regional rural banks and cooperative credit institutions up to March 31, 2007 and overdue as on December 31, 2007 will be covered under the scheme.ii For marginal farmers i.e., holding upto 1 hectare and small farmers 12 hectare, there will be a complete waiver of all loans that were overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008."
17515,2008-09,"In respect of other farmers, there will be a one time settlement OTS scheme for all loans that were overdue on December 31, 2007 and which remained unpaid until February 29, 2008."
17516,2008-09,"Under the OTS, a rebate of 25 per cent will be given against payment of the balance of 75 per cent.iii Agricultural loans were restructured and rescheduled by banks in 2004 and 2006 through special packages."
17517,2008-09,"These rescheduled loans, and other loans rescheduled in the normal course as per RBI guidelines, will also be eligible either for a waiver or an OTS on the same pattern.iv The implementation of the debt waiver and debt relief scheme will be completed by June 30, 2008."
17518,2008-09,"Upon being granted debt waiver or signing an agreement for debt relief under the OTS, the farmer would be entitled to fresh agricultural loans from the banks in accordance with normal rules.v Government estimates that about three crore small and marginal farmers and about one crore other farmers will benefit from the scheme."
17519,2008-09,"The total value of overdue loans being waived is estimated at Rs 50,000 crore and the OTS relief on the overdue loans is estimated at Rs 10,000 crore."
17520,2008-09,I appeal to Honourable Members  as well as to the people of India  to give their unqualified support to the scheme and help Government implement this momentous decision.
17521,2008-09,"IV. INVESTMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE, INDUSTRY AND TRADE74."
17522,2008-09,"Since 200506, there has been an unmistakable boom in investment."
17523,2008-09,Two indicators tell the story.
17524,2008-09,"The saving rate and the investment rate in 200304 were 29.8 per cent and 28.2 per cent, respectively."
17525,2008-09,"According to estimates made by the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, they will be 35.6 per cent and 36.3 per cent, respectively, by the end of 200708."
17526,2008-09,The trend is reflected on the foreign investment side too.
17527,2008-09,"During the period AprilDecember 200708, foreign direct investment amounted to US$12.7 billion and foreign institutional investment to US$18 billion."
17528,2008-09,"Our policy is to encourage all sources of investment, domestic and foreign, private and public.75."
17529,2008-09,"In 200809, Government will provide Rs 16,436 crore as equity support and Rs 3,003 crore as loans to Central Public Sector Enterprises CPSEs."
17530,2008-09,It is the policy of the Government to list more CPSEs in order to unlock their true value and improve corporate governance.
17531,2008-09,"The Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF is the main instrument to channelize bank funds for financing rural infrastructure, and it is quite popular among State Governments."
17532,2008-09,"Therefore, I propose to raise the corpus of RIDFXIV in 200809 to Rs 14,000 crore."
17533,2008-09,"I also propose to operate a separate window under RIDFXIV for rural roads with a corpus of Rs 4,000 crore."
17534,2008-09,There has been some moderation in the index of production of the six core infrastructure industries as well as in the overall index of industrial production for the period AprilDecember 200708.
17535,2008-09,"The decline has been somewhat sharp in the case of consumer goods, especially consumer durables."
17536,2008-09,"The silver lining is that the growth in capital goods is still very high at 20.2 per cent, indicating that industry continues to make huge capital investments and has a positive outlook about the future."
17537,2008-09,"Manufacturing industries that have grown more slowly than the average include food products, cotton textiles, textile products including apparel, paper and transport equipment."
17538,2008-09,Among the reasons for the moderation are a rise in interest rates and the appreciation of the Rupee.
17539,2008-09,"There are limits to monetary policy accommodation, especially when the need is to maintain price stability."
17540,2008-09,"However, some steps can be taken on the fiscal side and I shall, presently, place before the House some proposals in order to stimulate industrial growth."
17541,2008-09,Our goal is to take the manufacturing growth rate to a double digit.
17542,2008-09,This will also call for more reforms in the coal and electricity sectors as well as confronting oligopolistic tendencies in the cement and steel sectors.
17543,2008-09,"The Eleventh Plan target for additional power generation capacity is 78,577 MW which is more than the total capacity added in the previous three Plans."
17544,2008-09,"By end March 2008, we will achieve Commercial Operation Date COD on about 10,000 MW, marking the best first year in any Plan period."
17545,2008-09,Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that the ambitious target for the Eleventh Plan is achieved.79.
17546,2008-09,The fourth Ultra Mega Power Project UMPP at Tilaiya will be awarded shortly.
17547,2008-09,"It is possible to bring five more UMPPs in Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa and Tamilnadu to the bidding stage provided the States extend the required support."
17548,2008-09,I urge them to do so.80.
17549,2008-09,"Government has approved the continuation of the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana during the Eleventh Plan period with a capital subsidy of Rs 28,000 crore."
17550,2008-09,"I propose to allocate Rs 5,500 crore in 200809 for the Yojana including NER.81."
17551,2008-09,I propose to provide Rs 800 crore in 200809 for the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Project.
17552,2008-09,"However, it is the poor state of transmission and distribution T&D that is a drag on the sector."
17553,2008-09,"Huge investments are required to be made in T&D, but linked to fundamental reforms."
17554,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to create a national fund for transmission and distribution reform."
17555,2008-09,The details of the scheme will be worked out and announced very soon.
17556,2008-09,All phases of the National Highway Development Programme continue to make progress.
17557,2008-09,"The completion ratio in the Golden Quadrilateral is 96.48 per cent and in the North South, East West Corridor project is 23.36 per cent."
17558,2008-09,"Special attention is being paid to SARDPNE, a programme devised for the North Eastern region."
17559,2008-09,"I propose to enhance the allocation for the NHDP from Rs 10,867 crore in 200708 to Rs 12,966 crore next year."
17560,2008-09,The 7th round of bidding under the New Exploration Licensing Policy NELP was launched in December 2007 and bids have been invited for 57 exploration blocks.

17562,2008-09,A new Coal Distribution Policy was notified in October 2007.
17563,2008-09,A coal regulator will be appointed.
17564,2008-09,Government's forward looking policy is driving the growth of Information Technology and Information Technology Enabled Services.
17565,2008-09,"I propose to enhance the allocation to the Department of Information Technology from Rs 1,500 crore in 200708 to Rs 1,680 crore in 200809."
17566,2008-09,"A scheme for establishing 100,000 broadband internetenabled Common Service Centres in rural areas and a scheme for establishing State Wide Area Networks SWAN with Central assistance are under implementation."
17567,2008-09,A new scheme for State Data Centres has also been approved.
17568,2008-09,"I propose to provide Rs 75 crore for the common service centres, Rs 450 crore for SWAN and Rs 275 crore for the State Data Centres."
17569,2008-09,The two principal schemes of the Ministry of Textiles  the Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks SITP and the Technology Upgradation Fund TUF  will be continued in the Eleventh Plan period.
17570,2008-09,All 30 integrated textile parks have been approved and 20 units in four parks have commenced production.
17571,2008-09,I propose to maintain the provision for SITP at Rs 450 crore in 200809.
17572,2008-09,"The provision for TUF will be increased from Rs 911 crore in the current year to Rs 1,090 crore in 200809.87."
17573,2008-09,The cluster approach to the development of the handloom sector has made rapid progress.
17574,2008-09,"By March 2008, over 17 lakh families of weavers will be covered under the health insurance scheme."
17575,2008-09,I propose to increase the allocation to Rs 340 crore in 200809.88.
17576,2008-09,"In order to scale up both infrastructure and production, it is proposed to take up six centres for development as megaclusters."
17577,2008-09,"Varanasi and Sibsagar will be taken up for handlooms, Bhiwandi and Erode for powerlooms, and Narsapur and Moradabad for handicrafts."
17578,2008-09,Each megacluster will require about Rs 70 crore.
17579,2008-09,"I propose to start the process with an initial provision of Rs 100 crore in 200809.Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises89."
17580,2008-09,"Micro, small and medium enterprises will continue to receive support from the Government."
17581,2008-09,I wish to remove certain wrong perceptions about the sector.
17582,2008-09,"In the four years ending 200607, for which figures are available, there has been a secular rise in the number of registered units, the number of unregistered units, production, employment and exports."
17583,2008-09,"In order to give a fillip to the sector, I propose to create a risk capital fund in the Small Industries and Development Bank of India SIDBI."
17584,2008-09,"As on January 31, 2008, the Credit Guarantee Trust with SIDBI had extended guarantees to 89,129 units for an amount of Rs 2,479 crore."
17585,2008-09,SIDBI will reduce the guarantee fee from 1.5 per cent to 1 per cent and the annual service fee from 0.75 per cent to 0.5 per cent for loans up to Rs 5 lakh.
17586,2008-09,"Merchandise exports have come under some pressure due to the appreciation of the Rupee and may fall just short of the target of US$ 160 billion, although the growth rate was strong at 21.8 per cent during AprilDecember 200708."
17587,2008-09,"Relief was given to exporters in three tranches amounting to over Rs 8,000 crore."
17588,2008-09,"I may note that the interest cost of sterilization through market stabilization bonds MSS, estimated at Rs 8,351 crore for the whole year is, in a sense, subsidy to the export sector."
17589,2008-09,Government is sensitive to the needs of the export sector and will continue to respond sympathetically as the situation demands.
17590,2008-09,Government's policy of a careful and calibrated opening of the financial sector has proved successful.
17591,2008-09,We shall continue to take measured steps.92.
17592,2008-09,The final report of the Committee on Financial Inclusion has been received.
17593,2008-09,"To begin with, I propose to accept two recommendations:• to advise commercial banks, including RRBs, to add at least 250 rural household accounts every year at each of their rural and semiurban branches; and• to allow individuals such as retired bank officers, exservicemen etc to be appointed as business facilitator or business correspondent or credit counsellor.93."
17594,2008-09,Banks will be encouraged to embrace the concept of Total Financial Inclusion.
17595,2008-09,"Government will request all scheduled commercial banks to follow the example set by some public sector banks and meet the entire credit requirements of SHG members, namely, a income generation activities, b social needs like housing, education, marriage etc and c debt swapping."
17596,2008-09,"NABARD, SIDBI and NHB94."
17597,2008-09,"Financial inclusion can be taken forward by expanding the reach of NABARD, SIDBI and NHB."
17598,2008-09,"Hence, in order to increase the resource base of these three banks, I propose to tap into the resources of scheduled commercial banks to the extent that they fall short of their obligation to lend to the priority sector."
17599,2008-09,"Accordingly, it is proposed to create the following funds:i a fund of Rs 5,000 crore in NABARD to enhance its refinance operations to short term cooperative credit institutions;ii two funds of Rs 2,000 crore each in SIDBI  one for risk capital financing and the other for enhancing refinance capability to the MSME sector; andiii a fund of Rs 1,200 crore in NHB to enhance its refinance operations in the rural housing sector."
17600,2008-09,Each of these funds will be governed by the general guidelines that are now applicable to RIDF with some modifications.95.
17601,2008-09,"Last year, I enhanced the limit of the loan that could be extended under the Differential Rate of Interest DRI scheme to the weaker sections of the community engaged in gainful occupations."
17602,2008-09,"However, I did not enhance the eligibility criteria which still stand at levels fixed in 1986."
17603,2008-09,This needs to be corrected.
17604,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to fix the borrower's eligibility criteria as annual family income of Rs 18,000 in rural areas and Rs 24,000 in urban areas."
17605,2008-09,"In my Budget Speech of 2006, I had informed the House that, on the basis of the R.H. Patil Committee Report, we shall take steps to create an exchangetraded market for corporate bonds."
17606,2008-09,Both Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange have created platforms for trading in corporate bonds.97.
17607,2008-09,I intend to move forward by taking some more measures to expand the market for corporate bonds.
17608,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to:• take measures to develop the bond, currency and derivatives markets that will include launching exchangetraded currency and interest rate futures and developing a transparent credit derivatives market with appropriate safeguards;• enhance the tradability of domestic convertible bonds by putting in place a mechanism that will enable investors to separate the embedded equity option from the convertible bond and trade it separately; and• encourage the development of a marketbased system for classifying financial instruments based on their complexity and implicit risks.98."
17609,2008-09,The fear of the Permanent Account Number PAN has virtually disappeared.
17610,2008-09,PAN is now the sole identification number for all participants in the securities market.
17611,2008-09,"I propose to extend the requirement of PAN to all transactions in the financial market subject, however, to suitable threshold exemption limits.99."
17612,2008-09,Our stock exchanges provide national electronic trading platforms for securities transactions.
17613,2008-09,"Yet, we do not have a seamless national market for securities because of differences among States on the scope and applicability of rates of stamp duty."
17614,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to request the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers to work with the Central Government to create a truly pan Indian market for securities that will expand the market base and enhance the revenues of the State Governments."
17615,2008-09,India is poised to reap a 'demographic dividend' because the size of its working age population will increase from about 77.5 crore in 2008 to a likely peak of 95 crore in 2026.
17616,2008-09,The 'dividend' can prove illusory if the workforce does not acquire the skills to support a knowledge and technology driven economy.
17617,2008-09,"Today, skill development programmes are diffused and administered by a number of ministries/departments."
17618,2008-09,I have no intention of interfering with these sectorspecific programmes.
17619,2008-09,"However, there is a compelling need to launch a worldclass skill development programme, in mission mode, that will address the challenge of imparting the skills required by a growing economy."
17620,2008-09,Both the structure and the leadership of the mission must be such that the programme can be scaled up quickly to cover the whole country.
17621,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to establish a nonprofit corporation and entrust the mission to that corporation."
17622,2008-09,"It is my intention to garner about Rs 15,000 crore as capital from Governments, the public and private sector, and bilateral and multilateral sources."
17623,2008-09,"I shall begin by putting Rs 1,000 crore as Government's equity in the proposed nonprofit corporation."
17624,2008-09,The upgradation of ITIs is proceeding apace.
17625,2008-09,"Under the World Bank assisted scheme, 238 ITIs are undergoing upgradation."
17626,2008-09,"Under the PPP scheme, 309 ITIs in 29 States have been identified with corresponding industry partners and agreements have been signed in 244 cases."
17627,2008-09,"In anticipation of upgrading 300 more ITIs in 200809, I have set apart Rs 750 crore."
17628,2008-09,"I am concerned by the rate of attrition in the defence forces, especially at the officer level."
17629,2008-09,Sainik Schools have played a unique role as recruiting and training ground of future leaders of the defence forces.
17630,2008-09,"I propose to make an allocation of Rs 44 crore at the rate of Rs 2 crore each to the 22 Sainik Schools for immediate improvement of infrastructure including classrooms, laboratories, libraries and facilities for physical education."
17631,2008-09,"A sum of Rs 32,667 crore is being provided next year for food subsidy under the Public Distribution System PDS and other welfare programmes."
17632,2008-09,"Strengthening the PDS would mean adequate supplies, reasonable subsidies and efficient delivery of the subsidized food."
17633,2008-09,An idea that has been growing is to deliver subsidies to the target group through smart cards.
17634,2008-09,"Finally, I have found two willing partners  the State of Haryana and the Union Territory of Chandigarh."
17635,2008-09,"They will introduce, on a pilot basis, a smart card based delivery system to deliver food grains under the PDS in Haryana and Chandigarh, respectively."
17636,2008-09,I thank the Chief Minister of Haryana and the Administrator of Chandigarh and promise them full support and cooperation in making a success of the pilot scheme.
17637,2008-09,"The Unorganised Sector Workers' Social Security Bill, 2007 is before Parliament."
17638,2008-09,"In anticipation of the Bill being made into law, Government has introduced three schemes that are designed to provide social security to workers in the unorganised sector in a phased manner."
17639,2008-09,These are:• the Aam Admi Bima Yojana that will provide insurance cover to poor households.
17640,2008-09,"I am happy to announce that, in the first year of the Yojana, LIC will cover one crore landless households by September 30, 2008."
17641,2008-09,"I have already placed Rs 1,500 crore with LIC."
17642,2008-09,"In order to cover another one crore poor households in the second year, I propose to place an additional sum of Rs 1,000 crore with LIC in 200809;• the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana that will be implemented with effect from April 1, 2008; and• the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension Scheme that was enlarged with effect from November 19, 2007 to include all persons over 65 years falling under the BPL category."
17643,2008-09,"Consequently, the coverage has expanded from 87 lakh to 157 lakh beneficiaries."
17644,2008-09,"I propose to allocate Rs 3,443 crore in 200809 as against Rs 2,392 crore in 200708.Housing for the Poor106."
17645,2008-09,Housing for the poor is one of the six elements of Bharat Nirman and is implemented through the Indira Awas Yojana IAY.
17646,2008-09,"Against a target of 60 lakh houses, 41.13 lakh houses have been constructed up to December 2007 and the cumulative number will be 51.77 lakh houses by end March 2008."
17647,2008-09,"Reflecting the higher cost of construction, I propose to enhance the subsidy per unit in respect of new houses sanctioned after April 1, 2008 from Rs 25,000 to Rs 35,000 in plain areas and from Rs 27,500 to Rs 38,500 in hill/difficult areas."
17648,2008-09,"The subsidy for upgradation of houses will be increased from Rs 12,500 per unit to Rs 15,000."
17649,2008-09,A beneficiary will still need own funds to complete the house.
17650,2008-09,"Public sector banks will be advised to include IAY houses under the differential rate of interest DRI scheme and lend up to Rs 20,000 per unit at an interest rate of 4 per cent."
17651,2008-09,"I propose to increase the allocation for Defence by 10 per cent from Rs 96,000 crore to Rs 105,600 crore."
17652,2008-09,"I have assured the Raksha Mantri that any further amount needed for the Defence Forces, especially for capital expenditure, will be provided."
17653,2008-09,"The Backward Regions Grant Fund was given Rs 5,800 crore in the current year."
17654,2008-09,"Having regard to the pace of expenditure, I propose to keep the allocation for the next year at the same level."
17655,2008-09,"I may add that nearly 45 per cent of the amount is likely to be allocated to the States of Bihar, Orissa and Uttar Pradesh."
17656,2008-09,In the Budget Speech last year I had announced the decision of the Government to appoint an expert committee to study the impact of climate change on India and identify the measures that we may have to take in the future.
17657,2008-09,"Even while adhering to the principle of ""common but differentiated responsibility"" we can  and we must  do a number of things in our selfinterest."
17658,2008-09,We can promote clean technology products; we can review fuel emission and efficiency regulations; we can replace wood by solar as the fuel of common use; we can encourage the use of gas which is the most benign hydrocarbon; we can set up a trading platform for carbon emissions; we can build sustainable greenfield cities; and we can do more.
17659,2008-09,"In order to explore and implement these and other ideas, Government proposes to establish a permanent institutional mechanism that will play a development and coordination role."
17660,2008-09,Details of the institutional mechanism will be announced shortly.
17661,2008-09,"I have been informed that the Sixth Central Pay Commission will submit its report by March 31, 2008."
17662,2008-09,I am confident that the report will meet the legitimate expectations of Government employees.
17663,2008-09,The Commonwealth Games are only 947 days away.
17664,2008-09,"As promised, we shall provide Rs 624 crore in 200809."
17665,2008-09,I would urge the authorities concerned to adhere to the strict timelines and the quality standards.
17666,2008-09,"For the fourth year in succession, I propose to make a special grant of Rs 100 crore each to three institutions of excellence."
17667,2008-09,"The awards for 200809 go to: i Mahatma Phule Krishi Vidyapeeth, Rahuri, Maharashtra; ii University of Mysore, Mysore; and iii Delhi University, Delhi."
17668,2008-09,"India's music, literature, dance, art, cuisine and especially films are attracting huge interest around the world."
17669,2008-09,"This is the 'soft power' of India, and it must be projected in a sophisticated and subtle manner."
17670,2008-09,I propose to provide Rs 75 crore to the Indian Council of Cultural Relations to design and implement a programme to achieve this objective.
17671,2008-09,"The number 1,411 should ring the alarm bells."
17672,2008-09,That is the number of tigers in India.
17673,2008-09,The tiger is under grave threat.
17674,2008-09,"In order to redouble our effort to protect the tiger, I propose to make a one time grant of Rs 50 crore to the National Tiger Conservation Authority."
17675,2008-09,"The bulk of the grant will be used to raise, arm and deploy a special Tiger Protection Force."
17676,2008-09,"Robust economic growth has thrown up many new challenges, among them the need to put in place effective monitoring, evaluation and accounting systems for the large sums of money that are disbursed by the Central Government to State Governments, district level agencies and other implementing agencies."
17677,2008-09,I think we do not pay enough attention to outcomes as we do to outlays; or to physical targets as we do to financial targets; or to quality as we do to quantity.
17678,2008-09,Government therefore proposes to put in place a Central Plan Schemes Monitoring System CPSMS that will be implemented as a Plan scheme of the Planning Commission.
17679,2008-09,A comprehensive Decision Support System and Management Information System will also be established.
17680,2008-09,"The intended outcome is to generate and monitor schemewise and Statewise releases for about 1,000 Central Plan and centrally sponsored schemes in 200809.116."
17681,2008-09,Government also intends to strengthen evaluation.
17682,2008-09,Some ministries have started concurrent evaluation.
17683,2008-09,This needs to be supplemented by independent evaluations conducted by research institutions.
17684,2008-09,The Planning Commission will authorise such evaluations of the major schemes and complete the task by the time of the midterm review of the Eleventh Plan.
17685,2008-09,I shall now turn to the Budget Estimates for 200809.118.
17686,2008-09,"The estimate of Plan Expenditure is placed at Rs 243,386 crore."
17687,2008-09,"As a proportion of total expenditure, it will be 32.4 per cent.119."
17688,2008-09,"NonPlan Expenditure is estimated at Rs 507,498 crore."
17689,2008-09,Revenue Deficit and Fiscal Deficit120.
17690,2008-09,It is widely acknowledged that the fiscal position of the country has improved tremendously.
17691,2008-09,I am happy to report that the revenue deficit for the current year will be 1.4 per cent against a BE of 1.5 per cent and the fiscal deficit will be 3.1 per cent against a BE of 3.3 per cent.121.
17692,2008-09,Further progress will be made in 200809.
17693,2008-09,"The revenue receipts of the Central Government for 200809 are projected at Rs 602,935 crore and the revenue expenditure at Rs 658,119 crore."
17694,2008-09,"Consequently, the revenue deficit is estimated at Rs 55,184 crore, which amounts to 1.0 per cent of GDP."
17695,2008-09,"The fiscal deficit is estimated at Rs 133,287 crore which is 2.5 per cent of GDP."
17696,2008-09,"Honourable Members will note that not only will I achieve the target for fiscal deficit under the FRBM Act, I have also left for myself some headroom."
17697,2008-09,"In the case of revenue deficit, I will meet the target of annual reduction of 0.5 per cent."
17698,2008-09,"However, because of the conscious shift in expenditure in favour of health, education and the social sector, we may need one more year to eliminate the revenue deficit."
17699,2008-09,"In my view, this is an entirely acceptable deferment."
17700,2008-09,Revisiting the Roadmap for Fiscal Adjustment122.
17701,2008-09,"I acknowledge that significant liabilities of the Government on account of oil, food and fertilizer bonds are currently below the line."
17702,2008-09,This accounting arrangement is consistent with past practice.
17703,2008-09,"Nevertheless, our fiscal and revenue deficits are understated to that extent."
17704,2008-09,There is a need to bring these liabilities into our fiscal accounting.
17705,2008-09,"As a first step, I have shown these liabilities clearly in 'Budget at a Glance'."
17706,2008-09,"After the obligations on account of the Sixth Central Pay Commission become clear, I intend to request the Thirteenth Finance Commission to revisit the roadmap for fiscal adjustment and suggest a suitably revised roadmap."
17707,2008-09,"Mr. Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals.124."
17708,2008-09,"Many people are surprised by the buoyancy in tax revenues, especially in direct taxes."
17709,2008-09,I have always maintained that moderate and stable tax rates coupled with a tax administration that shows no fear or favour will bring high revenues to the exchequer.125.
17710,2008-09,The UPA Government inherited a tax to GDP ratio of 9.2 per cent in 200304.
17711,2008-09,"At the end of 200708, that ratio would have risen to 12.5 per cent.126."
17712,2008-09,High growth rates have helped.
17713,2008-09,Changes in attitude have also helped.
17714,2008-09,"Above all, information systems and technology have helped most."
17715,2008-09,"And, if I may add in a lighter vein, having a lucky Finance Minister may have also helped!"
17716,2008-09,We are on course to achieve the Budget Estimates of indirect taxes and exceed the Budget Estimates of direct taxes.
17717,2008-09,I take this opportunity to thank all tax payers and I promise them an efficient and tax payerfriendly administration.
17718,2008-09,I shall begin with customs duties.128.
17719,2008-09,The peak rate for nonagricultural products was 20 per cent in January 2004 and now stands at 10 per cent.
17720,2008-09,"The collection rate is the closest approximation to the level of protection to domestic industry, and that rate for all imports stood at 10 per cent in 200607."
17721,2008-09,"Since April 2007, the Rupee has appreciated against the Dollar by 9.8 per cent."
17722,2008-09,"Consequently, the case for reducing the peak rate at this stage is very weak."
17723,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to make no change in the peak rate of customs duty.129."
17724,2008-09,"However, I find that in some cases it is necessary to reduce the customs duty in order to provide a fillip to that industry or to promote value addition or to remove inversion or any other anomaly."
17725,2008-09,I shall refer to a few such cases.130.
17726,2008-09,I propose to reduce the customs duty on Project Imports from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.
17727,2008-09,"However, I also propose to impose the 4 per cent special CVD on a few specified projects in the power sector.131."
17728,2008-09,"In order to improve the supply of raw material, I propose to reduce the duty on steel melting scrap and aluminium scrap from 5 per cent to nil.132."
17729,2008-09,"On certain specified life saving drugs and on the bulk drugs used for the manufacture of such drugs, I propose to reduce the customs duty from 10 per cent to 5 per cent as well as to totally exempt them from excise duty or countervailing duty.133."
17730,2008-09,"In order to reduce the cost of manufacture of cattle and poultry feeds, I propose to reduce the duty on vitamin premixes and mineral mixtures from 30 per cent to 20 per cent and on phosphoric acid from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.134."
17731,2008-09,The duty on bactofuges will be reduced from 7.5 per cent to nil.
17732,2008-09,This will increase the shelf life of milk and benefit the dairy industry.135.
17733,2008-09,I propose to fully exempt from duty specified parts of set top boxes and specified raw materials for use in the IT/electronic hardware industry.136.
17734,2008-09,"To establish parity between devices used in the information/ communication sector and the entertainment sector, I propose to reduce the duty on convergence products from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.137."
17735,2008-09,"To provide a fillip to the manufacture of sports goods, I propose to reduce the duty on specified machinery from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent."
17736,2008-09,I also propose to exempt from duty specified raw materials for sports goods.138.
17737,2008-09,The gem and jewellery industry has responded well to the duty reductions made last year.
17738,2008-09,"In order to encourage value addition and exports, I propose to exempt from duty rough cubic zirconia and to reduce the duty on polished cubic zirconia from 10 per cent to 5 per cent."
17739,2008-09,"Similarly, the duty on rough coral will be reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.139."
17740,2008-09,"To facilitate training of helicopter pilots, I propose to remove the duty on helicopter simulators.140."
17741,2008-09,"In order to support domestic fertiliser production, I propose to reduce the customs duty on crude and unrefined sulphur from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.141."
17742,2008-09,"Thanks to a complex regime of export benefits and duty exemptions, naphtha is exported from refineries and naphtha is imported by manufacturers of polymers, leading to price distortions and revenue losses."
17743,2008-09,I propose to correct the situation by withdrawing the duty exemption on naphtha for use in the manufacture of polymers and subject it to the normal rate of 5 per cent.
17744,2008-09,"However, naphtha imported for the production of fertilisers will continue to be exempt from import duty.142."
17745,2008-09,"Finally, in order to conserve chrome ore and make it available for value added manufacture in India, I propose to increase the export duty from Rs 2,000 per metric tonne to Rs 3,000 per metric tonne.143."
17746,2008-09,I shall now deal with excise duties.144.
17747,2008-09,The manufacturing sector is the backbone of any economy.
17748,2008-09,It is consumption that drives production and it is production that drives investment.
17749,2008-09,"Having carefully studied current trends of production and consumption, I believe there is a need to give a stimulus to the manufacturing sector."
17750,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to reduce the general CENVAT rate on all goods from 16 per cent to 14 per cent.145."
17751,2008-09,I have looked at specific sectors where growth is flagging.
17752,2008-09,These sectors are important because they are growth and employment drivers.
17753,2008-09,Some of them also have large externalities.
17754,2008-09,"Therefore, I propose to:• reduce the excise duty on all goods produced in the pharmaceutical sector from 16 per cent to 8 per cent;• reduce the excise duty on buses and their chassis from 16 per cent to 12 per cent;• reduce the excise duty on small cars from 16 per cent to 12 per cent and on hybrid cars from 24 per cent to the general revised rate of 14 per cent;• reduce the excise duty on two wheelers and three wheelers from 16 per cent to 12 per cent; and• reduce the excise duty on paper, paper board and articles made therefrom manufactured out of nonconventional raw materials by units not having an attached bamboo/wood pulp making plant from 12 per cent to 8 per cent with a further reduction on clearances up to 3,500 MT from 8 per cent to nil."
17755,2008-09,"Furthermore, excise duty on certain varieties of writing, printing and packing paper will be reduced from 12 per cent to 8 per cent.146."
17756,2008-09,There are a number of products which are goods of mass consumption.
17757,2008-09,There is also the need to have tax parity on similar goods.
17758,2008-09,"Taking into account requests from a number of industries, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to nil on a few items including composting machines, wireless data cards, packaged coconut water, tea and coffee mixes, and puffed rice.147."
17759,2008-09,"Further, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 16 per cent to 8 per cent on a few items including water purification devices, veneers and flush doors, sterile dressing pads, specified packaging material, and breakfast cereals.148."
17760,2008-09,"I propose to totally exempt from excise duty the anti AIDS drug, Atazanavir, as well as bulk drugs for its manufacture.149."
17761,2008-09,"To further encourage cold chain facilities, I propose to exempt from excise duty, on enduse basis, refrigeration equipment consisting of compressor, condenser units, evaporator etc above 2 TR tonne refrigeration utilising power of 50 KW and above.150."
17762,2008-09,I propose to bring parity in the excise duty rates on bulk cement and packaged cement.
17763,2008-09,"Accordingly, bulk cement will now attract excise duty of Rs 400 per Metric Tonne or 14 per cent ad valorem, whichever is higher."
17764,2008-09,Cement clinkers will be liable to excise duty of Rs 450 per Metric Tonne.151.
17765,2008-09,"Similarly, I propose to increase the excise duty on packaged software from 8 per cent to 12 per cent to bring it on par with customised software which will attract a service tax of 12 per cent.152."
17766,2008-09,"Nonfilter cigarettes are more toxic than filter cigarettes, yet they enjoy a favourable tax regime, which is iniquitous."
17767,2008-09,I propose to tax both filter and nonfilter cigarettes on par by applying  as Honourable Members may have guessed  the higher rates.153.
17768,2008-09,"In order to remove a source of misinformation, I propose to abolish the ad valorem part of the excise duty on unbranded petrol and unbranded diesel and replace the same by an equivalent specific duty of Rs 1.35 per litre."
17769,2008-09,"Henceforth, there will be only a specific duty of Rs 14.35 per litre on unbranded petrol and Rs 4.60 per litre on unbranded diesel."
17770,2008-09,There will be no impact on retail prices.154.
17771,2008-09,"An excise duty of 1 per cent called NCCD is now imposed on polyester filament yarn, which is the only yarn suffering this excise duty."
17772,2008-09,I propose to remove that duty and shift the levy to cellular mobile phones.155.
17773,2008-09,"Finally, I turn to my proposals on service tax.156."
17774,2008-09,I propose to bring under the service tax net four services.
17775,2008-09,"They are:i asset management service provided under ULIP, to bring it on par with asset management service provided under mutual funds;ii services provided by stock/commodity exchanges and clearing houses;iii right to use goods, in cases where VAT is not payable; andiv customised software, to bring it on par with packaged software and other IT services157."
17776,2008-09,I also propose to remove unwarranted doubts raised in respect of certain services and clarify that they are liable to service tax.
17777,2008-09,"These include money changers, persons running games of chance, and tour operators using contract carriage vehicles.158."
17778,2008-09,There are some miscellaneous changes but I do not wish to burden the House with the same.159.
17779,2008-09,"Finally, I am happy to announce that the threshold limit of exemption for small service providers will be increased from Rs 8 lakhs per year to Rs 10 lakh per year."
17780,2008-09,"As a result, about 65,000 small service providers will go out of the tax net."
17781,2008-09,I shall now deal with direct taxes.161.
17782,2008-09,I recall the Budget Speech of 1997.
17783,2008-09,I believe that boldness pays.
17784,2008-09,"I also believe that trust will beget trust, moderation will beget revenues and fairness will beget compliance."
17785,2008-09,Income tax payers have made out a persuasive case for some relief.
17786,2008-09,"Accordingly, I propose to make some changes in the slabs for personal income tax."
17787,2008-09,"I propose to increase the threshold limit of exemption:• in the case of all assesses, from Rs 110,000 to Rs 150,000, thus giving every assessee a relief at a minimum of Rs 4,000."
17788,2008-09,"Consequently, the four slabs and rates will be as follows:Up to Rs 150,000 NILRs 150,001 to Rs 300,000 10 per centRs 300,001 to Rs 500,000 20 per centRs 500,001 and above 30 per cent• in the case of a woman assessee, from Rs 145,000 to Rs 180,000;• in the case of a senior citizen, from Rs 195,000 to Rs 225,000.162."
17789,2008-09,I do not propose to make any change in the corporate income tax rates.163.
17790,2008-09,No change is proposed in the rate of surcharge.164.
17791,2008-09,I propose to add the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme 2004 and the Post Office Time Deposit Account to the basket of saving instruments under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.165.
17792,2008-09,"I propose to allow an additional deduction of Rs 15,000 under Section 80D to an individual who pays medical insurance premium for his/her parent or parents.166."
17793,2008-09,The Reverse Mortgage Scheme was notified by the National Housing Bank in the current financial year.
17794,2008-09,"In order to clarify the tax issues arising out of the scheme, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act to provide that:i reverse mortgage would not amount to ""transfer""; andii the stream of revenue received by the senior citizen would not be ""income"";167."
17795,2008-09,Agricultural income is exempt from income tax.
17796,2008-09,"However, courts have ruled that growing saplings or seedlings on land is agriculture but growing them in pots is not agriculture."
17797,2008-09,This does not seem fair.
17798,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to exempt from tax income arising from saplings or seedlings grown in a nursery.168."
17799,2008-09,Companies engaged in certain businesses are allowed a weighted deduction of 150 per cent on any expenditure on inhouse scientific research.
17800,2008-09,I propose to add the business of production of seeds and manufacture of agricultural implements to this list.169.
17801,2008-09,"In order to promote outsourcing of research, I propose to allow a weighted deduction of 125 per cent on any payment made to companies engaged in research and development.170."
17802,2008-09,I propose to extend the benefit of amortisation of certain preliminary expenses under Section 35D to assesses in the services sector.171.
17803,2008-09,"To supplement measures that I announced earlier in respect of the corporate debt market, I propose to exempt from TDS corporate debt instruments issued in demat form and listed on recognised stock exchanges.172."
17804,2008-09,I propose to make some changes in the provisions of law pertaining to Fringe Benefit Tax FBT that will give some relief to corporates and firms.
17805,2008-09,"Crèche facilities, sponsorship of an employeesportsperson, organising sports events for employees, and guest houses will be excluded from the purview of FBT.173."
17806,2008-09,"At present, a domestic company is liable to pay Dividend Distribution Tax DDT."
17807,2008-09,"As a result, the distributed dividend is sometimes taxed twice in the hands of a subsidiary company and its parent company, causing hardship."
17808,2008-09,"In order to remove the hardship, I propose to allow a parent company to set off the dividend received from its subsidiary company against dividend distributed by the parent company, provided that the dividend received has suffered DDT and the parent company is not a subsidiary of another company.174."
17809,2008-09,"I propose to insert a new subsection 11C in Section 80IB to grant a five year tax holiday to encourage hospitals to be set up anywhere in India, except certain specified urban agglomerations, and especially in tier2 and tier3 towns in order to serve the rural hinterland."
17810,2008-09,"This window will be open for the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013, during which the hospital must commence operations.175."
17811,2008-09,"Having regard to the significant rise in tourist arrivals, especially for cultural tourism, I propose to grant a five year holiday from income tax to two, three or four star hotels that are established in specified districts which have UNESCOdeclared 'World Heritage Sites'."
17812,2008-09,"The hotel should be constructed and start functioning during the period April 1, 2008 to March 31, 2013.176."
17813,2008-09,I am happy to announce that the Coir Board will be included in Section 1029A and exempt from income tax.177.
17814,2008-09,Dividends that are distributed attract a tax of 15 per cent.
17815,2008-09,Short term capital gains attract a tax of 10 per cent under Section 111A.
17816,2008-09,There is merit in equating the rates and hence I propose to increase the rate of tax on short term capital gains under Section 111A and Section 115AD to 15 per cent.
17817,2008-09,This will also encourage investors to stay invested for a longer term.178.
17818,2008-09,"At present, Securities Transaction Tax STT paid is allowed as a rebate against tax liability."
17819,2008-09,"Further, STT on options is levied on the aggregate of the strike price and the option premium and is borne by the seller."
17820,2008-09,I propose to make some changes.
17821,2008-09,"Henceforth, STT paid will be treated like any other deductible expenditure against business income."
17822,2008-09,"Further, the levy of STT, in the case of options, will be only on the option premium where the option is not exercised, and the liability will be on the seller."
17823,2008-09,"In a case where the option is exercised, the levy will be on the settlement price and the liability will be on the buyer."
17824,2008-09,There will be no change in the present rates.179.
17825,2008-09,Transactions in commodity futures have come of age.
17826,2008-09,"Hence, I propose to introduce the Commodities Transaction Tax CTT on the same lines as STT on options and futures.180."
17827,2008-09,"These activities are tax exempt, as they should be."
17828,2008-09,"However, some entities carrying on regular trade, commerce or business or providing services in relation to any trade, commerce or business and earning incomes have sought to claim that their purposes would also fall under ""charitable purpose""."
17829,2008-09,"Obviously, this was not the intention of Parliament and, hence, I propose to amend the law to exclude the aforesaid cases."
17830,2008-09,Genuine charitable organisations will not in any way be affected.181.
17831,2008-09,The Banking Cash Transaction Tax BCTT has served a very useful purpose in enlarging the information system of the Income Tax Department.
17832,2008-09,"Since the information is also being gathered through other instruments introduced in the last few years, I propose to withdraw this tax with effect from April 1, 2009.182."
17833,2008-09,My tax proposals on direct taxes are revenue neutral.
17834,2008-09,"On the indirect taxes side, the proposals are estimated to result in a loss of Rs 5,900 crore."

17845,2008-09,Those are not my words; they were uttered in 1955 by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru.
17846,2008-09,"Although Jawaharlal Nehru did not use the phrase inclusive growth, he actually spelt out the conditions for inclusive growth.186."
17847,2008-09,Those words will guide the UPA Government.
17848,2008-09,"As always, I turned to my muse, Saint Tiruvalluvar, for guidance and reassurance."
17849,2008-09,"The four years to 200708 have been the best years so far but, may I say with humility, that the best is yet to come.187."
17850,2008-09,"Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to the House."
17851,2009-10,I rise to present the Interim Budget for 200910.2.Five years ago the people ofIndiahad voted for change.
17852,2009-10,"In the words of our Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, people had sought “a change in the manner in which this country is run, a change in the national priorities and a change in the processes and focus of the Government”."
17853,2009-10,"The Common Minimum Programme of the United Progressive Alliance, built around‘Aam Aadmi’, was a response to this call for change."
17854,2009-10,"As indicated by Shri P. Chidambaram in July 2004, this programme spelt out seven clear economic objectives:imaintaining a growth rate of 78 per cent per year for a sustained period;iiproviding universal access to quality basic education and health;iiigenerating gainful employment and promoting investment;ivassuring hundred days of employment to the breadwinner in each family at the minimum wage;vfocusing on agriculture, rural development and infrastructure;viaccelerating fiscal consolidation and reform; andviiensuring higher and more efficient fiscal devolution.3.As I present the sixth budget of the Government of the United Progressive Alliance which completes its tenure in a couple of months, I can say with confidence that every effort has been made by the government to deliver on the commitments made.4.For the first four years of the UPA government, our policies ensured a dream run for the economy with Gross Domestic Product GDP recording increase of 7.5 per cent, 9.5 per cent, 9.7 per cent and 9 per cent from fiscal year 200405 to 200708.For the first time, the Indian economy showed sustained growth of over 9 per cent for three consecutive years."
17855,2009-10,"With per capita income growing at 7.4 per cent per annum, this represented the fastest ever improvement in living standards over a four year period.5.During this period, the fiscal deficit came down from 4.5 per cent in 200304 to 2.7 per cent in 200708 and the revenue deficit declined from 3.6 per cent to 1.1 per cent.6.Investment and savings showed significant improvement."
17856,2009-10,The domestic investment rate as a proportion ofGDPincreased from 27.6 per cent in 200304 to over 39 per cent in 200708.The gross domestic savings rate shot up from 29.8 per cent to 37.7 per cent during this period.
17857,2009-10,The gross capital formation in agriculture as a proportion of agricultureGDPimproved from 11.1 per cent in 200304 to 14.2 per cent in 200708.7.The buoyant growth of Government revenues facilitated fiscal consolidation as mandated in the FRBM Act.
17858,2009-10,The tax toGDPratio increased from 9.2 per cent in 200304 to 12.5 per cent in 200708 bringing us within striking distance of the target for fiscal correction.
17859,2009-10,This also enhanced our capacity to raise resources internally to finance our growth at the rate of 9 per cent per annum during the Eleventh Five Year Plan.8.All
17860,2009-10,"Sonia Gandhi, the inspiring leadership of Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh and the hard work put in by my predecessor, Shri P. Chidambaram."
17861,2009-10,"Mr. Speaker,Sir,9.The growth drivers for this period were agriculture, services, manufacturing along with trade and construction."
17862,2009-10,Hon’ble Members will agree with me that the real heroes ofIndia’s success story were our farmers.
17863,2009-10,"Through their hard work, they ensured “food security” for the country."
17864,2009-10,"With record procurement of 22.7 million tonnes of wheat and 28.5 million tonnes of rice for our Public Distribution System in 2008, our granaries are full."
17865,2009-10,"During this four year period, the annual growth rate of agriculture rose to 3.7 per cent."
17866,2009-10,"The production of foodgrains increased by about 10 million tonnes each year to reach an all time high of over 230 million tonnes in 200708.Despite a high base, the outlook for 200809 is encouraging with the country receiving normal rainfall during the agricultural season."
17867,2009-10,"Manufacturing, registered as well as unregistered, recorded a growth of 9.5 per cent per annum in the period 200405 to 200708.Similarly, communication and construction sectors grew at the rate of 26 per cent and 13.5 per cent per annum, respectively.10.Though our growth is based largely on domestic efforts, foreign trade and capital inflows played a catalytic role."
17868,2009-10,India’s exports grew at an annual average growth rate of 26.4 per cent in US dollar terms during this period.
17869,2009-10,"Foreign trade increased from 23.7 per cent of GDP in 200304 to 35.5 per cent in 200708.The conscious policy to gradually integrate the Indian economy with the world, opened new opportunities for Indian corporates to build world scale plants and aim at global competitiveness.11.In order to maintain a highGDPgrowth rate on a sustained basis with price stability, the Indian economy had to face two interrelated macroeconomic challenges."
17870,2009-10,These relate to capital inflows and global inflation.
17871,2009-10,Profitable investment opportunities generated by highGDPgrowth attract foreign capital.
17872,2009-10,"In 200708, capital inflows spurted to an unprecedented 9 per cent ofGDP, far in excess of current account financing requirements leading to large accumulation of reserves and build up of pressure on prices.12.During 200809, international prices of many essential commodities particularly fuel oils, food and edible oils and metals rose to alarming levels."
17873,2009-10,"To cite just one example, the price of crude oil which was US $ 28 per barrel in 200304 shot up to US $ 147 per barrel in 2008."
17874,2009-10,"The sharp rise in global inflation, even with a moderated passthrough, put pressure on domestic prices."
17875,2009-10,"The WPI headline inflation shot up to nearly 13 per cent in the first week of August 2008.To ease supply side constraints, Government took a series of fiscal and administrative measures, in concert with monetary policy measures by the Reserve Bank ofIndia."
17876,2009-10,RBI raised the interest rates to mop up excess liquidity.
17877,2009-10,"This, in turn, had implications for the growth rate from the demand as well as supply side."
17878,2009-10,"These, along with easing of global price pressures, led to a decline in domestic prices with inflation rate falling to 4.4 per cent onJanuary 31, 2009.We have weathered the crisis, but there is no room for complacency."
17879,2009-10,Outlook for the year 200809Mr.
17880,2009-10,"Speaker, Sir, I now turn to the outlook for the current year and the events that have impacted its prospects.13.The global financial crisis which began in 2007 took a turn for the worse in September 2008 with the collapse of several international financial institutions, including investment banks, mortgage lenders and insurance companies."
17881,2009-10,There has been a severe choking of credit since then and a global crash in stock markets.
17882,2009-10,"The slowdown intensified with theUS, Europe andJapansliding into recession."
17883,2009-10,Current indications of the global situation are not encouraging.
17884,2009-10,Forecasts indicate that the World economy in 2009 may fare worse than in 2008.14.A crisis of such magnitude in developed countries is bound to have an impact around the world.
17885,2009-10,Most emerging market economies have slowed down significantly.
17886,2009-10,"For the first nine months of the current year, the growth rate of exports has come down to 17.1 per cent."
17887,2009-10,"According to the latest figures available, the industrial production has fallen by 2 per cent yearonyear basis in December 2008.In these difficult times, when most economies are struggling to stay afloat, a healthy 7.1 per cent rate of GDP growth still makesIndiathe second fastest growing economy in the world.15.To counter the negative fallout of the global slowdown on the Indian economy, our Government took prompt action by providing substantial fiscal stimulus."
17888,2009-10,"The two packages announced onDecember 7, 2008andJanuary 2, 2009, provide tax relief to boost demand and aim at increasing expenditure on public projects to create employment and public assets."
17889,2009-10,"In this context, the Government renewed its efforts to increase infrastructure investments."
17890,2009-10,"In the period from August 2008 to January 2009 alone, the Government accorded approval for 37 infrastructure projects worth Rs 70 thousand crore.16.In addition to expanding public sector investment in infrastructure, our Government has also taken steps to encourage private investment in infrastructure through Public Private Partnership PPP.I am happy to say that the Government of India has been successful in attracting private investment in infrastructure sectors such as telecommunications, power generation, airports, ports, roads and railways."
17891,2009-10,"Under the PPP mode, 54 Central Sector infrastructure projects with a total project cost of Rs 67 thousand seven hundred crore have been given inprinciple or final approval by the PPP Appraisal Committee and23 projects amounting to Rs 27 thousand nine hundred crore have been approved for viability gap funding in 200809.17.To ensure that such projects do not face financing difficulties arising from the current downturn, we have taken a new initiative for providing refinance to the banks for long term credit extended to these projects."
17892,2009-10,"Accordingly, the Government has decided that India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd. IIFCL will refinance 60 per cent of commercial bank loans forPPPprojects in critical sectors over the next eighteen months or so."
17893,2009-10,"For this purpose, IIFCL has been authorized to raise Rs 10 thousand crore in the market by the end of March 2009.An additional Rs 30 thousand crore can be raised if required."
17894,2009-10,"With this, IIFCL and banks will be able to support projects involving a total investment of Rs 100 thousand crore in infrastructure."
17895,2009-10,"Combined with the steps we are taking to increase public investment in infrastructure, this will provide a big boost to such investment.18.The RBI took a number of monetary easing and liquidity enhancing measures including reduction in cash reserve ratio, statutory liquidity ratio and key policy rates."
17896,2009-10,The objective was to facilitate flow of funds from the financial system to meet the needs of productive sectors.
17897,2009-10,Our Government has also announced specific measures to address the impact of global slowdown onIndia’s exports.
17898,2009-10,"These include extension of export credit for labour intensive exports, improving the pre and post shipment credit availability,additional allocations for refund of Terminal Excise Duty/CST and export incentive schemes, and removal of export duty and export ban on certain items."
17899,2009-10,"A Committee of Secretaries has been set up to address, on continuing basis, procedural problems being faced by exporters."
17900,2009-10,"Mr.Speaker,Sir,19.The favorable economic environment created by the reforms of 1990’s gradually inspired the confidence of foreign investors in our economy, leading to rise in capital inflows."
17901,2009-10,Indiahas evolved a liberal and transparent policy for Foreign Direct Investment FDI.
17902,2009-10,"Except for a small negative list, FDI is allowed mostly on the automatic route."
17903,2009-10,"During 200708, we received a record US $ 32.4 billion of FDI."
17904,2009-10,"In spite of global financial crisis, inward FDI flows during AprilNovember 2008 were US$ 23.3 billion, representing a growth of 45 per cent over the same period in 2007.Latest figures show a slow down."
17905,2009-10,"To provide an impetus to foreign investment inIndia, guidelines are being further simplified and made homogenous and consistent across various sectors.20.Extraordinary economic circumstances merit extraordinary measures."
17906,2009-10,Now is the time for such measures.
17907,2009-10,"Our Government decided to relax the FRBM targets, in order to provide much needed demand boost to counter the situation created by the global financial meltdown."
17908,2009-10,"Indeed, depending on the response of the domestic economy and the revival of the global economy, there may be a need to consider additional fiscal measures when the regular budget is presented by the new Government after the elections."
17909,2009-10,"However, the medium term objective must be to revert to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest."
17910,2009-10,The Thirteenth Finance Commission has been asked to lay down the roadmap in this regard.
17911,2009-10,"The new Government will have to address it in the light of future developments in the domestic and international economic environment.21.The recent developments have also brought out the need for accelerating the pace of policy reforms, including in the financial sector, to make the economy more competitive."
17912,2009-10,"The economic regulatory and oversight systems have to be made more efficient and effective to bring the economy back to the 9 per cent growth path at the earliest.22.We also have to take note of Prof. Amartya Sen’s observation and I quote “along with old slogan of ‘growth with equity’, we also need a new commitment towards ‘down turn with security’, given the fact that occasional downturns are common  possibly inescapable  in market economies” unquote."
17913,2009-10,Employment generation schemes have to be expanded and social security nets have to be strengthened to protect the vulnerable sections of our society.

17976,2009-10,"During the same period, profits of CPSEs have increased by 72 per cent from Rs 53 thousand crore to Rs 91 thousand crore and their contribution to the Central Exchequer by way of dividend, interest and taxes and duties has recorded an increase of 86 per cent."
17977,2009-10,"The number of loss making enterprises has come down from 73 in 200304 to 55 in 200708 and the number of profit making enterprises has gone up from 143 to 158 during the same period.31.In order to maintain ethics and probity in the functioning of CPSEs, the Government approved the implementation of Guidelines on Corporate Governance in CPSEs in June, 2007.32.In November 2007, Government constituted the National Investment Fund into which the proceeds from disinvestment of Government equity in Central Public Sector Enterprises CPSEs are deposited."
17978,2009-10,"Threequarters of annual income of the Fund will be used to finance select social sector schemes which promote education, health and employment."
17979,2009-10,The residual 25 per cent annual income of the Fund will be used to meet the capital investment requirements of profitable and revivable CPSEs.
17980,2009-10,"As onDecember 31, 2008, the corpus of the Fund was about Rs 1815 crore."
17981,2009-10,"Financial Sector Reforms33.Over past years, technological, institutional and legal reforms in the financial sector have resulted in Public Sector Banks achieving significant improvement in their financial health."
17982,2009-10,"The asset quality has improved and NPAs have declined considerably from 7.8 per cent onMarch 31, 2004to 2.3 per cent onMarch 31, 2008.34.In the case of Regional Rural Banks RRBs, a process of amalgamation and recapitalization of those with negative networth has been initiated."
17983,2009-10,"Over the last four years, 196 RRBs have been merged into 85 RRBs."
17984,2009-10,"The Central Government has contributed Rs 652 crore for the capitalization of RRBs uptoDecember 31, 2008.35.The UPA Government has undertaken a number of reforms in the last four years to deepen and widen the Securities markets and strengthen the regulatory mechanisms for these markets."
17985,2009-10,"The initiatives include reforms in the corporate bond market, participation of foreign institutional investors, foreign investment in stock exchanges, setting up of a dedicated training and research institute in the securities market, making PAN the sole identification number, streamlining the process and grading of initial public offering etc.Systems and practices have been put in place to promote a safe, transparent and efficient market and to protect market integrity.36.The Government undertook a comprehensive revision of the Companies Act, 1956 to make it a compact law that, while responding to the changes in the business environment, would enable adoption of internationally accepted best practices."
17986,2009-10,"The Companies Bill, 2008 based on this exercise, has been introduced in Parliament."
17987,2009-10,"Mr. Speaker, Sir,Tax effort37.In the days of financial stress, tax rates must fall and our ability to pay taxes must rise."
17988,2009-10,"Therefore, our Government undertook comprehensive reforms of the tax system, both the direct and the indirect tax system, with a view to improving its efficiency and equity."
17989,2009-10,Distortions within the tax structure have been reduced by expanding the tax base and moderating the tax rates.
17990,2009-10,The personal incometax rates have been rationalized by increasing the threshold limit and adjusting the tax slabs to provide relief to taxpayers.
17991,2009-10,"Similarly, Customs Duty rates have been steadily reduced to eliminate the bias against the export sector and promote competition and efficiency in the manufacturing sector."
17992,2009-10,"The rates of Union Excise Duties and Service Tax have also been rationalized to enable eventual shift to the Goods and Services Tax onApril 1, 2010.The Government also facilitated the introduction of the State level VAT in April 2005.38.These structural changes were also supported by undertaking modernisation of the business processes of the tax administration through extensive use of information technology, viz., efiling of returns, epayment of taxes, issue of refunds through ECS and refund bankers, computer assisted selection of returns for scrutiny, establishing taxpayer information system and a computerised tax payment reporting system."
17993,2009-10,These measures have enabled the tax administration to enhance its functional efficiency and provide better taxpayer service leading to increased compliance levels.
17994,2009-10,"To prevent movement of contraband goods across the country’s sea borders, the Government has sanctioned acquisition of 109 marine vessels for the Customs Department."
17995,2009-10,"Government set up the second Administrative Reforms Commission in August 2005 with a mandate to suggest measures to achieve a proactive, responsive, accountable, sustainable and efficient administration for the country at all levels of the government."
17996,2009-10,"The Commission has brought out number of reports with practical recommendations, providing a starting point for improving efficiency in the delivery of public services."
17997,2009-10,"The enactment of the Right to Information Act in 2005 at the Centre and in many States has bridged a critical gap in the public decisionmaking process, ushering in greater accountability of the public servants.40.The Sixth Central Pay Commission submitted its recommendations in March, 2008.Government considered and improved upon the recommendations of the Sixth Central Pay Commission."
17998,2009-10,This has benefited over 45 lakh Central Government employees including Defence Forces and Para Military forces and over 38 lakh pensioners.
17999,2009-10,It is my hope that this will not only improve the quality of administration but will also help the economy by supporting demand.
18000,2009-10,"Speaker, Sir, I shall now briefly go over the Revised Estimates for 200809.42.The Budget Estimate for 200809 had placed the total expenditure at Rs 7,50,884 crore."
18001,2009-10,"This has now been revised to Rs 900,953 crore, showing an increase of Rs 1,50,069 crore.43.Plan Expenditure for 200809 was placed at Rs 2,43,386 crore in the Budget Estimate."
18002,2009-10,"It has now gone up to Rs 2,82,957 crore in the Revised Estimate."
18003,2009-10,"The additional plan spending of Rs 39,571 crore is on account of an increase in Central Plan by Rs 24,174 croreand an increase of Rs 15,397 crore in the Central Assistance to State and UT Plans."
18004,2009-10,"The Central Plan expenditure has increased for Rural Development, Atomic Energy, Telecommunications, Textiles, Urban Development, Youth Affairs and Sports and Railways."
18005,2009-10,"The increase in Central Assistance for State and UT Plans is on account of additional Central Assistance for Externally Aided Projects, Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme, Roads and Bridges, National Social Assistance Programme, Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and Tsunami Rehabilitation.44.On the NonPlan side, the additionality of Rs 1,10,498 crore in the Revised Estimates is accounted for by an increase in the expenditure of Rs 44,863 crore on fertilizer subsidy, Rs 10,960 crore on food subsidy, Rs 15,000 crore on Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme, Rs 7,605 crore on Pensions,and Rs 5,149 crore on Police."
18006,2009-10,"An additional amount of Rs 9,000 crore has also been provided for Defence expenditure.45.NonTax Revenues constitute an important component of our receipts."
18007,2009-10,"As against the Budget Estimates of Rs 95,785 crore for 200809, the Revised Estimates for the NonTax Revenues are Rs 96,203 crore.46.In keeping with the recent trend, the actual tax collections during200708 exceeded the Revised Estimates for 200708, both for Direct and Indirect Taxes."
18008,2009-10,"However, for 200809, the RE of tax collection is projected at Rs 6,27,949 crore as against the BE of Rs 6,87,715 crore."
18009,2009-10,This shortfall is primarily on account of the Government's proactive fiscal measures initiated to counter the impact of global slowdown on the Indian economy.
18010,2009-10,"A substantial relief of about Rs 40,000 crore has been extended through tax cuts, including a fairly steep across the board reduction in Central Excise rates in December, 2008."
18011,2009-10,"Despite this, it is expected that the tax collection in 200809 would exceed last year’s collection.47.Taking into account the variations in receipts and expenditure, the current year is expected to end with a Revenue Deficit of Rs 2,41,273 crore as against the budgeted figure of Rs 55,184 crore."
18012,2009-10,"Accordingly, the revised Revenue Deficit stands at 4.4 per cent ofGDPinstead of 1.0 per cent in the Budget Estimates."
18013,2009-10,"Similarly, the fiscal deficit for 200809 has gone up from Rs 1,33,287 crore in the BE toRs 3,26,515 crore in the RE."
18014,2009-10,"The revised fiscal deficit is estimated at 6 per cent of theGDPas against the budgeted figure of 2.5 per cent.48.Constitutional propriety requires that new Government formulates the tax and expenditure policies for 200910.These policies, in the medium term perspective, would have to:apursue macro economic policies to sustain a growth rate of at least 9 per centper annum over an extended period of time;bstrengthen the mechanisms for inclusive growth for creating about 12 million new work opportunities per annum;creduce the proportion of people living below poverty line to less than half from current levels by 2014;densure that Indian agriculture continues to grow at annual rate of at least 4 per cent;ebridge the infrastructure gap by increasing the investment in infrastructure to more than 9 per cent ofGDPby 2014;fsupport Indian industry to meet the challenge of global competition and sustain the growth momentum in exports;gstrengthen and improve the economic regulatory framework in the country;hexpand"
18015,2009-10,"Therefore, I am presenting an Interim Budget for the purpose of Vote on Account to enable the Government to meet expenditure during the first four months of the next financial year."
18016,2009-10,"Mr. Speaker, Sir,50.Let me now turn to the Estimates for the Interim Budget 200910.Budget Estimates 20091051.I am proposing the total expenditure for fiscal 200910 at Rs 9,53,231 crore."
18017,2009-10,"This includes a provision of Rs 2,85,149 crore under plan and Rs 6,68,082 crore under non plan.52.The plan allocation under various heads provided at this stage is limited to the provision at the BE stage last year, plus additional amounts on account of the two stimulus packages, which has been reflected in the Revised Estimates for 200809."
18018,2009-10,It also reflects a modest increase in Central Assistance to the States to enable the States to complement their budgetary resources.
18019,2009-10,"The total Gross Budgetary Support GBS for the Plan at Rs 2,85,149 crore, is 17.16 per cent higher in nominal terms than the GBS Plan for BE 200809.53.The budgetary support to the Plan for 200910, in comparison to BE 200809 has been increased for Department of Rural Development, Department of Road Transport and Highways, Railways, Ministry of Power, Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion and Department of Information Technology with a view to maintain the fiscal tempo to address the economic slowdown and meet the requirements of rural and infrastructure development."
18020,2009-10,"In addition, enhanced Plan allocations have been provided for Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports and Ministry of Culture to ensure availability of adequate resources for the preparation towards hosting of the Commonwealth Games next year."
18021,2009-10,I have ensured adequate allocations to our flagship programmes which directly impactAam Aadmi:iNational Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme was launched in February 2006 and has now been extended to all the districts of the country.
18022,2009-10,"During the year 200809, employment of 138.76 crore person days, covering 3.51 crore households, has already been generated."
18023,2009-10,"The implementation of this programme has resulted in increased wage employment, enhanced wage earnings, improved equity with significant benefits flowing to SC/ST and women."
18024,2009-10,This has also led to increased demand for and consumption of wage goods.
18025,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 30,100 crore for this Scheme for the year 200910.iiSarva Shiksha Abhiyan has made significant contribution in providing access to and infrastructure for elementary education."
18026,2009-10,About 98 per cent of our habitations have been covered by primary schools and the focus now is to improve the quality of elementary education.
18027,2009-10,"Between 200304 and 200809, the allocation for this programme has been increased by 571 per cent."
18028,2009-10,"For the year 200910, I propose an allocation of Rs 13,100 crore for this programme.iiiThe national programme of Midday Meals in schools is the world’s largest school feeding programme and has contributed to enhancement of school participation, reduction in class room hunger, and fostering of social and gender parity."
18029,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 8,000 crore to this Scheme for the year 200910.ivIn our Government’s efforts to universalize the Integrated Child Development Scheme ICDS in the country, it was expanded twice in the last five years to cover the hitherto uncovered habitations across the country."
18030,2009-10,"In our commitment to reduce the malnutrition levels in the country, the UPA Government has recently adopted the New WHO Child Growth Standards for monitoring growth of children under ICDS."
18031,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 6,705 crore for this Scheme for the year 200910.vJawaharlal"
18032,2009-10,"Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was launched to give focused attention to integrated development for urban infrastructure and services in mission mode, in identified cities."
18033,2009-10,"A major achievement of the UPA Government is development and extension of Mass Rapid Transport System MRTS in major cities like Bengaluru, Chennai,Delhi,Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai."
18034,2009-10,"Under Jawaharlal National Urban Renewal Mission, 386 projects amounting to Rs 39,000 crore have been sanctioned as ofDecember 31, 2008.For the year 200910, I propose an allocation of Rs 11,842 crore for this programme.viRajiv Gandhi Rural Drinking Water Mission is envisaged to supply safe drinking water to uncovered habitations and slipped back habitations."
18035,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 7,400 crore for this programme for the year 200910.viiTotal Rural Sanitation Programme is a continuous process."
18036,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 1,200 crore for this programme for the year 200910.viiiNational Rural HealthMissionaims to bring about uniformity in quality of preventive and curative healthcare in rural areas across the country."
18037,2009-10,"I propose an allocation of Rs 12,070 crore for this programme during the year 200910.ixBharat Nirman is a time bound plan for building rural infrastructure."
18038,2009-10,"It has six components namely, rural roads, telephony, irrigation, drinking water supply, housing and electrification."
18039,2009-10,There has been all round progress in the implementation of this programme.
18040,2009-10,"During 20052009, the allocation to this programme has been increased by 261 per cent."
18041,2009-10,"For the year 200910, I propose an allocation of Rs 40,900 crore for this programme.54.The UPA Government has been working on improving arrangements to ensure that development deliverables reach the intended beneficiaries."
18042,2009-10,"In order to do so efficiently, effectively and economically, a comprehensive system of Unique Identity for the resident population of the country has been worked out."
18043,2009-10,"The Unique Identification Authority of India is being established under the aegis of Planning Commission for which a notification has been issued in January 2009.A provision of Rs 100 crore has been made in the Annual Plan 200910 for this.55.To ensure continuity in financing of rural infrastructure projects, I propose RIDFXV with a corpus of Rs 14,000 crore and continuation of the separate window for rural roads with a corpus of Rs 4,000 crore.56.To counter the negative impact on exports due to the global financial crisis, I propose to extend the interest subvention of 2 per cent on pre and post shipment credit for certain employment oriented sectors i.e. Textiles including handloom & handicrafts, Carpets, Leather, Gem and Jewellery, Marine products and SMEs beyond March 31, 2009 tillSeptember 30, 2009.This is expected to involve an additional financial outgo of Rs 500 crore during Financial Year 200910.57.Government would recapitalize the public sector banks over next two years to enable them to maintain Capital to Risk Weighted Assets Ratio CRAR of 12 per cent and to ensure that credit growth continues to sustain economic growth.58.While the proposed provisions are appropriate for a VoteonAccount, I would like to point out that Plan expenditure for 200910 may have to be increased substantially at the time of the presentation of the regular Budget, if we are to give the economy the stimulus it needs to cope with the global recession that is likely to continue through the year."
18044,2009-10,"In the current environment, there is a clear need for contracyclical policy and it calls for a substantial increase in expenditure in infrastructure development where we have a large gap and in rural development where the programs such as Bharat Nirman and NREGS are playing a vital social role."
18045,2009-10,"Since the scope for revenue mobilization is bound to be limited in a period of economic slowdown, any increase in plan expenditure will increase the fiscal deficit."
18046,2009-10,"Indeed, we may have to consider additional plan expenditure of anything from 0.5 per cent to 1.0 per cent of the GDP and gear up our systems accordingly."
18047,2009-10,"Mr. Speaker, Sir,59.We are going through tough times."
18048,2009-10,The Mumbai terror attacks have given an entirely new dimension to crossborder terrorism.
18049,2009-10,A threshold has been crossed.
18050,2009-10,Our security environment has deteriorated considerably.
18051,2009-10,"In this context, I propose to increase the allocation for Defence, which is a part of non plan expenditure to Rs 1,41,703 crore."
18052,2009-10,"This will include Rs 54,824 crore for capital expenditure."
18053,2009-10,"Needless to say, any additional requirement for the security of the nation will be provided for.60.I am also making a provision of Rs 95,579 crore for major subsidies including food, fertilizer and petroleum.61.For the fiscal 200910, Gross Tax Revenue receipts at the existing rates of taxation are estimated at Rs 6,71,293 crore and Centre’s net tax revenue at Rs 5,00,096 crore."
18054,2009-10,"With revenue expenditure estimated at Rs 8,48,085 crore, the revenue deficit amounts to 4.0 per cent ofGDP."
18055,2009-10,"Fiscal Deficit is estimated at Rs 3,32,835 crore which is 5.5 per cent ofGDP."
18056,2009-10,"This would be lower than in 200809, but higher than would be appropriate under normal circumstances."
18057,2009-10,"However, conditions in the year ahead are not likely to be normal and, therefore, the high fiscal deficit is inevitable."
18058,2009-10,"We will return to FRBM targets once the economy is restored to its recent trend growth path.62.Honourable members are aware that the ceiling of fiscal deficit that the States can incur in 200809, in terms of the Debt Consolidation and Relief Facility set up under the Twelfth Finance Commission award has been increased by 0.5 per cent of the GSDP to 3.5 per cent."
18059,2009-10,This may have to be reviewed in view of the response of the economy in the coming months.
18060,2009-10,Conclusion63.Indiahas arrived on the international economic scene.
18061,2009-10,"In the last five years, the Indian economy has grown at an impressive 8.6 per cent which is much faster than ever before."
18062,2009-10,This growth has been more inclusive providing people expanded opportunities for livelihood.
18063,2009-10,"The creative energies of our farmers, entrepreneurs, businessmen, scientists, engineers and workers have been unleashed.64.Increased global competitiveness of Indian enterprise, its resilience to global shocks, and a positive economic outlook has contributed to a marked change in the way the Indian economy is being viewed, within and outside the country.65.The successful launch ofChandrayaanand the historic feat of placing the Indian tricolour on Moon’s surface has made us members of a very select club of countries who have well developed space programmes.66.Indiahas made determined progress in finding its rightful place in the Comity of Nations with a credible voice that matters in the deliberations of the global political and economic order."
18064,2009-10,We have succeeded in dismantling the nuclear apartheid thatIndiawas subjected to for more than three decades.
18065,2009-10,"This has opened up new opportunities for civil nuclear cooperation and cleared the pathways for rapid industrialization of our country.67.For all this and more, I would like to express my deep gratitude to UPA partners and supporters who walked the extra mile with us in this journey.68.Mr."
18066,2009-10,"Speaker, Sir, our people will soon be called upon to exercise their democratic right to choose the next Government."
18067,2009-10,The Indian people have repeatedly shown that they can be relied upon to make sound decisions to secure the nation’s future.
18068,2009-10,They have seen how the‘Aam Aadmi’has become the focus of the development process.
18069,2009-10,They have also seen how our Government has successfully steered the country through difficult times.
18070,2009-10,They have experienced the joy of being citizens of a proud nation moving ahead with confidence.
18071,2009-10,"I have no doubt that when the time comes, our people will recognize the hand that made it all possible."
18072,2009-10,"The hand that alone can help our nation on the road to peace and prosperity.69.Sir, with these words, I commend the Interim Budget to the House."
18073,2010-11,"I rise to present the Union Budget for 201011.In 2009, when I presented the interim Budget in February and the regular Budget in July in this august House, the Indian economy was facing grave uncertainties."
18074,2010-11,Growth had started decelerating and the business sentiment was weak.
18075,2010-11,"The economy's capacity to sustain high growth was under serious threat from the widespread economic slowdown in the developed world.2.It was not clear to us, as also to the policy makers in many other countries, how this crisis would eventually unfold."
18076,2010-11,What would be its impact on the growth momentum of the Indian economy?How soon will we be able to turnaround the fortunes of our economy?
18077,2010-11,"The short term global outlook was bleak and the consensus was that year 2009 would face the brunt of this crisis across the world.3.At home, there was added uncertainty on account of the delayed and subnormal southwest monsoon, which had undermined the kharif crop in the country."
18078,2010-11,"There were concerns about production and prices of food items and its possible repercussions on the growth of rural demand.4.Today, as I stand before you, I can say with confidence that we have weathered these crises well."
18079,2010-11,Indian economy now is in a far better position than it was a year ago.
18080,2010-11,"That is not to say that the challenges today are any less than what they were nine months ago when UPA under the leadership of Mrs Sonia Gandhi was elected back to power and Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh formed the Government for the second term.5.The three challenges and the medium term perspective that I had outlined in my last Budget Speech remain relevant, even today."
18081,2010-11,These would continue to engage the Indian policyplanners for the next few years.6.Thefirstchallenge before us is to quickly revert to the high GDP growth path of 9 per cent and then find the means to cross the 'double digit growth barrier'.
18082,2010-11,This calls for imparting a fresh momentum to the impressive recovery in growth witnessed in the past few months.
18083,2010-11,"In this endeavour, I seek Lord Indra's help to make the recovery more broadbased in the coming months.7.Growth is only as important as what it enables us to do and be."
18084,2010-11,"Therefore, thesecondchallenge is to harness economic growth to consolidate the recent gains in making development more inclusive."
18085,2010-11,"The thrust imparted to the development of infrastructure in rural areas has to be pursued to achieve the desired objectives within a fixed time frame.8.We have to strengthen food security, improve education opportunities and provide health facilities at the level of households, both in rural and urban areas."
18086,2010-11,"These are issues that require significant resources, and we have to find those resources.9.Thethirdchallenge relates to the weaknesses in government systems, structures and institutions at different levels of governance."
18087,2010-11,"Indeed, in the coming years, if there is one factor that can hold us back in realising our potential as a modern nation, it is the bottleneck of our public delivery mechanisms."
18088,2010-11,"There have been many initiatives in this regard, in different sectors, at different points of time."
18089,2010-11,Some of them have been effective in reforming the way the Government works in those areas.
18090,2010-11,But we have a long way to go before we can rest on this count.10.The Union Budget cannot be a mere statement of Government accounts.
18091,2010-11,"It has to reflect the Government's vision and signal the policies to come in future.11.With development and economic reforms, the focus of economic activity has shifted towards the nongovernmental actors, bringing into sharper focus the role of Government as an enabler.12.An enabling Government does not try to deliver directly to the citizens everything that they need."
18092,2010-11,Instead it creates an enabling ethos so that individual enterprise and creativity can flourish.
18093,2010-11,Government concentrates on supporting and delivering services to the disadvantaged sections of the society.13.It is this broad conceptualisation of the Budget that informs my speech today.
18094,2010-11,I would now begin by presenting a brief overview of the economy.
18095,2010-11,"Overview of the Economy14.Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past twelve months."
18096,2010-11,I intend to highlight only a few salient features that form the backdrop of this Budget.15.The fiscal year 200910 was a challenging year for the Indian economy.
18097,2010-11,"The significant deceleration in the second half of 200809, brought the real GDP growth down to 6.7 per cent, from an average of over 9 per cent in the preceding three years."
18098,2010-11,We were among the first few countries in the world to implement a broadbased countercyclic policy package to respond to the negative fallout of the global slowdown.
18099,2010-11,It included a substantial fiscal expansion along with liberal monetary policy support.16.The effectiveness of these policy measures became evident with fast paced recovery.
18100,2010-11,"The economy stabilised in the first quarter of 200910 itself, when it clocked a GDP growth of 6.1 per cent, as against 5.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of the preceding year."
18101,2010-11,"It registered a strong rebound in the second quarter, when the growth rate rose to 7.9 per cent."
18102,2010-11,"With the Advance Estimates placing the likely growth for 200910 at 7.2 per cent, we are indeed vindicated in our policy stand."
18103,2010-11,The final figure may well turn out to be higher when the third and fourth quarter GDP estimates for 200910 become available.17.This recovery is very encouraging for it has come about despite a negative growth in the agriculture sector.
18104,2010-11,"More importantly, it is the result of a renewed momentum in the manufacturing sector and marks the rise of this sector as the growth driver of the economy."
18105,2010-11,The growth rate in manufacturing in December 2009 was 18.5 per cent— the highest in the past two decades.
18106,2010-11,There are also signs of a turnaround in the merchandise exports with a positive growth in November and December 2009 after a decline of about twelve successive months.

18109,2010-11,"With some luck, I hope to breach the 10 per cent mark in nottoodistant a future.18.A major concern during the second half of 200910 has been the emergence of double digit food inflation."
18110,2010-11,"There was a momentum in food prices since the flareup of global commodity prices preceding the financial crisis in 2008, but it was expected that the agriculture season beginning June 2009 would help in moderating the food inflation."
18111,2010-11,"However, the erratic monsoons and drought like conditions in large parts of the country reinforced the supply side bottlenecks in some of the essential commodities."
18112,2010-11,This set in motion inflationary expectations.
18113,2010-11,"Since December 2009, there have been indications of these high food prices, together with the gradual hardening of the fuel product prices, getting transmitted to other nonfood items as well."
18114,2010-11,"The inflation data for January seems to have confirmed this trend.19.Government is acutely conscious of this situation and has set in motion steps, in consultation with the StateChiefMinisters, which should bring down the inflation in the next few months and ensure that there is better management of food security in the country."

18119,2010-11,Fiscal Consolidation22.The success of the fiscal stimulus in supporting domestic demand could be traced to its composition.
18120,2010-11,The approach of the Government was to increase the disposable income in the hands of the people by effecting reductions in indirect taxes and by expanding public expenditure on programmes like the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme and rural infrastructure.
18121,2010-11,"Now that the recovery has taken root, there is a need to review public spending, mobilise resources and gear them towards building the productivity of the economy.23.In shaping the fiscal policy for 201011, I have acted on the recommendations of the Thirteenth Finance Commission."
18122,2010-11,It has recommended a calibrated exit strategy from the expansionary fiscal stance of last two years.

18136,2010-11,"Market capitalization of five companies which have been listed since October, 2004 has increased by 3.8 times from the book value of Rs 78,841 crore to Rs 2,98,929 crore.30.The effective management of public expenditure by bringing it in line with the Government's objectives is a part of the fiscal consolidation process."

18143,2010-11,"Government will ensure that nutrient based fertiliser prices for transition year 201011, will remain around MRPs currently prevailing."

18401,2010-11,"Indirect Taxes141.The major objectives that have guided me in the formulation of my proposals on indirect taxes are the need to achieve some degree of fiscal consolidation without impairing the recovery process and moving forward on the road to GST.142.Unlike the time I presented the last Budget, symptoms of economic recovery are more widespread and clearcut now."
18402,2010-11,The three fiscal stimulus packages that the Government introduced in quick succession have helped the process of recovery significantly.
18403,2010-11,The improvement in our economic performance encourages a course of fiscal correction even as the global situation warrants caution.
18404,2010-11,"Therefore, I propose to partially roll back the rate reduction in Central Excise duties and enhance the standard rate on all nonpetroleum products from 8 per cent to 10 per centad valorem."

18408,2010-11,"In view of the pressing need to move back to a fiscal consolidation path, I propose to restore the basic duty of 5 per cent on crude petroleum; 7.5 per cent on diesel and petrol and 10 per cent on other refined products."

18415,2010-11,This exemption is to lapse in July 2010.The modernization of this labourintensive sector is yet to reach the expected level.
18416,2010-11,"I propose therefore, to extend it up to March 31, 2011 along with a CVD exemption."
18417,2010-11,I hope this will provide sufficient time for the sector to achieve the desired objective.151.One of the prerequisites for agricultural productivity is access to good quality and diseaseresistant seeds.

18432,2010-11,I also propose to exempt some critical parts or subassemblies of such vehicles from basic customs duty and special additional duty subject to actual user condition.
18433,2010-11,These parts would also enjoy a concessional CVD of 4 per cent.159.The humble cycle rickshaw is now being acclaimed as an environmentfriendly means of transport.

18449,2010-11,The concession available to Government hospitals or hospitals set up under a statute is also being retained.165.The manufacturers of orthopaedic implants have represented that their inputs attract a higher rate of duty than the finished product.

18452,2010-11,"The film industry has been experiencing difficulties in importing digital masters of films for duplication or distribution loaded on electronic medium visavisthose imported on cinematographic film, owing to a differential customs duty structure."
18453,2010-11,I propose to rationalise this by charging customs duty only on the value of the carrier medium.

18471,2010-11,"Service Tax178.The service sector contributes nearly 60 per cent of the GDP.The service tax to GDP ratio however, is only around 1 per cent."
18472,2010-11,"This sector thus, has significant potential to augment revenue.179.To bridge this gap, I had the option to raise the rate of service tax to 12 per cent as it was before I introduced the third stimulus package."
18473,2010-11,I am not resorting to this option to maintain the growth momentum and also to bring about a convergence in the rates of tax on goods and services.

18490,2011-12,The economy is back to its precrisis growth trajectory.
18491,2011-12,"While agriculture has shown a rebound, industry is regaining its earlier momentum."
18492,2011-12,Services sector continues its near double digit run.
18493,2011-12,Fiscal consolidation has been impressive.
18494,2011-12,"This year has also seen significant progress in those critical institutional reforms that would set the pace for doubledigit growth in the near future.3.While we succeeded in making good progress in addressing many areas of our concern, we could have done better in some others."
18495,2011-12,"The total food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February 2010 to less than half at 9.3 per cent in January 2011, but it still remains a concern."
18496,2011-12,"In the medium term perspective, our three priorities of sustaining a high growth trajectory; making development more inclusive; and improving our institutions, public delivery and governance practices, remain relevant."
18497,2011-12,These would continue to engage the Indian policyplanners for some time.
18498,2011-12,"However, there are some manifestations of these challenges that need urgent attention in the short term."
18499,2011-12,"We have to ensure that along with private consumption, the revival in private investment is sustained and matches precrisis growth rates at the earliest."
18500,2011-12,This requires a stronger fiscal consolidation to enlarge the resource space for private enterprise and addressing some policy constraints.  
18501,2011-12,We also have to improve the supply response of agriculture to the expanding domestic demand.
18502,2011-12,Determined measures on both these issues will help address the structural concerns on inflation management.
18503,2011-12,It will also ensure a more stable macroeconomic environment for continued high growth.5.The UPA Government has significantly scaled up the flow of resources to rural areas to give a more inclusive thrust to the development process.
18504,2011-12,The impact is visible in the new dynamism of our rural economy.
18505,2011-12,It has helped India navigate itself rapidly out of the quagmire of global economic slowdown.
18506,2011-12,"Yet, there is much that still needs to be done, especially in rural India."
18507,2011-12,We have to reconcile legitimate environmental concerns with necessary developmental needs.

18509,2011-12,"However, the implementation gaps, leakages from public programmes and the quality of our outcomes are a serious challenge."
18510,2011-12,"Even as the Government is engaged in addressing specific concerns emanating from some of these events in the larger public interest and in upholding the rule of law, such an impression is misplaced."
18511,2011-12,"We have to seize in these developments, the opportunity to improve our regulatory standards and administrative practices."
18512,2011-12,Corruption is a problem that we have to fight collectively.
18513,2011-12,"Indeed, in a democratic polity, it stands to benefit from inputs from colleagues on both sides of the House."
18514,2011-12,They must lend their voice and expertise to influence public policy in the wider national interest.
18515,2011-12,"In some areas, good results depend on coordinated efforts of the Centre and the State Governments and in some others, on favourable external developments.9.I see the Budget for 201112 as a transition towards a more transparent and result oriented economic management system in India."
18516,2011-12,"We are taking major steps in simplifying and placing the administrative procedures concerning taxation, trade and tariffs and social transfers on electronic interface, free of discretion and bureaucratic delays."
18517,2011-12,"This will set the tone for a newer, vibrant and more efficient economy."
18518,2011-12,"In preparing this year's Budget, I have been deeply conscious of this fact."
18519,2011-12,I am grateful for the able guidance of the Hon’ble Prime Minister and the strong support lent by UPA Chairperson Smt.
18520,2011-12,Sonia Gandhi in my endeavour.
18521,2011-12,I would now begin with a brief overview of the economy.
18522,2011-12,"I. Overview of the Economy11.On last Friday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey 201011, which gives a detailed analysis of the economic situation of the country over the past 12 months."
18523,2011-12,The Gross Domestic Product GDP of India is estimated to have grown at 8.6 per cent in 201011 in real terms.
18524,2011-12,"In 201011 agriculture is estimated to have grown at 5.4 per cent, industry at 8.1 per cent and services at 9.6 per cent."
18525,2011-12,All three sectors are contributing to the consolidation of growth.
18526,2011-12,"More importantly, the economy has shown remarkable resilience to both external and domestic shocks."
18527,2011-12,Inflation surfaced in two distinct episodes.
18528,2011-12,"At the beginning of the year, food inflation was high for some cereals, sugar and pulses."
18529,2011-12,"Towards the second half, while prices of these items moderated and even recorded negative rates of inflation, there was spurt in prices of onion, milk, poultry and some vegetables."
18530,2011-12,Of late prices of onion have crashed in wholesale markets and we have had to remove the ban on their exports.
18531,2011-12,"These developments revealed shortcomings in distribution and marketing systems, which are getting accentuated due to growing demand for these food items with rising income levels."
18532,2011-12,The huge differences between wholesale and retail prices and between markets in different parts of the country are just not acceptable.
18533,2011-12,These are at the expense of remunerative prices for farmers and competitive prices for consumers.
18534,2011-12,"As the transmission lag in monetary policy tends to be long, I expect the measures already taken by the RBI to further moderate inflation in coming months.15.The developments on India's external sector in the current year have been encouraging."
18535,2011-12,"Even as the recovery in developed countries is gradually taking root, our trade performance has improved."
18536,2011-12,"Exports have grown at 29.4 per cent to reach US Dollar 184.6 billion, while imports at US Dollar 273.6 billion have recorded a growth of 17.6 per cent during AprilJanuary 201011, over the corresponding period last year."
18537,2011-12,The current account deficit is around the200910 level and poses some concerns because of the composition of its financing.
18538,2011-12,"To realise the desired outcomes, it is important that there is convergence in expectations of our investors, entrepreneurs and consumers on the macroeconomic prospects of the economy."
18539,2011-12,"Against this backdrop, the Indian economy is expected to grow at 9 per cent with an outside band of +/ 0.25 per cent in 201112."
18540,2011-12,I expect the average inflation to be lower next year and the current account deficit smaller and better managed with higher domestic savings rate and stable capital flows.
18541,2011-12,"While, like last year, I seek the blessings of Lord Indra to bestow on us timely and bountiful monsoons, I would pray to Goddess Lakshmi as well."
18542,2011-12,I think it is a good strategy to diversify one's risks.
18543,2011-12,"In the course of the year, I have moved further on that path."
18544,2011-12,I believe that a part of the current recovery must be stored away to build future resilience.
18545,2011-12,"Indeed, a counter cyclical fiscal policy is our best insurance against external shocks and localised domestic factors."
18546,2011-12,"Fiscal Consolidation18.The experience with Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 FRBM Act at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level show that statutory fiscal consolidation targets have a positive effect on macroeconomic management of the economy."
18547,2011-12,"In the course of the year the Central Government would introduce an amendment to the FRBM Act, laying down the fiscal road map for the next five years.19.The Thirteenth Finance Commission has worked out a fiscal consolidation road map for States requiring them to eliminate revenue deficit and achieve a fiscal deficit of 3 per cent of their respective Gross State Domestic Product latest by 201415."
18548,2011-12,It has also recommended a combined States’ debt target of 24.3 per cent of GDP to be reached during this period.
18549,2011-12,The States are required to amend or enact their FRBM Acts to conform to these recommendations.
18550,2011-12,A Middle Office is already operational.
18551,2011-12,"As a next step, I propose to introduce the Public Debt Management Agency of India Bill in the next financial year."
18552,2011-12,The introduction of the Direct Taxes Code DTC and the proposed Goods and Services Tax GST will mark a watershed.
18553,2011-12,"These reforms will result in moderation of rates, simplification of laws and better compliance."

18571,2011-12,"The extension of the NBS regime to cover urea is under active consideration of the Government.27.The Government provides subsidies, notably on fuel and food grains, to enable the common man to have access to these basic necessities at affordable prices."

18591,2011-12,"Since most of the infrastructure companies are organised in the form of SPVs, FIIs would also be permitted to invest in unlisted bonds with a minimum lockin period of three years."
18592,2011-12,"However, the FIIs will be allowed to trade amongst themselves during the lockin period."

18887,2011-12,I propose to reduce the current surcharge of 7.5 per cent on domestic companies to 5 per cent.
18888,2011-12,"Simultaneously, I propose to increase the rate of Minimum Alternate Tax MAT from the current rate of 18 per cent to 18.5 per cent of book profits to keep the effective rate of the MAT at the same level."
18889,2011-12,"As a measure to ensure equal sharing of the corporate tax liability, I propose to levy MAT on developers of Special Economic Zones as well as units operating in SEZs."
18890,2011-12,I propose to extend this window for one more year.
18891,2011-12,"For the year 201112, I propose a lower rate of 15 per cent tax on dividends received by an Indian company from its foreign subsidiary.  "
18892,2011-12,I do hope these funds will now flow to India.    
18893,2011-12,"Considering the importance of housing, I also propose investment linked deduction to businesses which develop affordable housing under a notified scheme."
18894,2011-12,I propose to further enhance this to 200 per cent.
18895,2011-12,"Indirect TaxesI shall now turn to my indirect tax proposals.152.In view of the healthy growth in indirect taxes in 201011, I had the option to roll back the Central excise duty to levels prevailing in November 2008."
18896,2011-12,I have chosen not to do so for two reasons.
18897,2011-12,I would like to see improved business margins translated into higher investment rates.
18898,2011-12,I would also like to stay my course towards GST.
18899,2011-12,I have therefore decided to maintain the standard rate of Central excise duty at 10 per cent.
18900,2011-12,"At present, there are about 100 items that are exempt from Central Excise as well as State VAT."
18901,2011-12,"In addition, there are as many as 370 items that enjoy exemption from Central Excise duty but are chargeable to VAT."
18902,2011-12,I propose to withdraw the exemption on 130 of these items that are mainly in the nature of consumer goods.
18903,2011-12,The remaining 240 items would be brought into the tax net when GST is introduced.
18904,2011-12,No Cenvat credit would be available for the manufacture of these items.
18905,2011-12,Basic food and fuel would continue to be exempt.
18906,2011-12,This levy would also not apply to precious metals and stones.
18907,2011-12,"In case of jewellery and articles of gold, silver and precious metals, the levy would apply only to goods sold under a brand name.155.Most of the States have increased their merit rate of VAT from 4 per cent to 5 per cent."
18908,2011-12,"In line with this, I also propose to enhance the lower rate of Central Excise duty from 4 per cent to 5 per cent.156.Readymade garments and madeups of textiles are currently under an optional excise duty regime.  "
18909,2011-12,A manufacturer is required to pay duty only if he wishes to avail of Cenvat credit.
18910,2011-12,Our garment and madeups industry has come of age and has shown handsome growth in recent years.  
18911,2011-12,"As part of base expansion, I propose to convert the optional levy into a mandatory levy at a unified rate of 10 per cent."
18912,2011-12,"The levy would however, apply only to branded garments or madeups and not to those tailored or made to order for a retail customer."
18913,2011-12,"Credit of tax paid on inputs, capital goods and input services would be available to manufacturers of these products.  "
18914,2011-12,"Keeping in mind the fragmented nature of this industry, full SSI exemption is also being extended to these products.  "
18915,2011-12,Export of these items would continue to be zerorated.157.We have a long term commitment to align our customs duty rates to those prevailing in ASEAN countries.  
18916,2011-12,The peak rate of customs duty has been reduced over the years and has settled at 10 per cent.  
18917,2011-12,"In view of continued uncertainties in the global economy, I propose to hold the peak rate at its current level.  "
18918,2011-12,"However, some rationalization is being done to unify three rates namely, 2 per cent, 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent at the middle level of 2.5 per cent."
18919,2011-12,"Agriculture & Related Sectors159.Hon'ble Members would recall that, in the last Budget, I had announced a package of measures to improve the availability of storage and warehouse facilities for agricultural produce as well as to incentivize food processing.  "
18920,2011-12,I have received encouraging feedback on the impact of these measures.
18921,2011-12,"I propose to enlarge the scope of these exemptions by:•extending full exemption from excise duty to airconditioning equipment and refrigeration panels for cold chain infrastructure;•including conveyor belts in the full exemption from excise duty to equipment used in cold storages, mandis and warehouses.160.A concessional rate of basic customs duty of 5 per cent was provided to specified agricultural machinery in the last budget."
18922,2011-12,This duty is being reduced further to 2.5 per cent and the concession is also being extended to parts of such machinery to encourage their domestic production.  
18923,2011-12,I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on microirrigation equipment from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent.  
18924,2011-12,I propose to provide full exemption from basic customs duty to this item.  
18925,2011-12,"Simultaneously, an export duty of 10 per cent would be levied to discourage its export."
18926,2011-12,"Manufacturing Sector 163.For the manufacturing sector, my proposals seek to encourage domestic value addition visavis imports, to remove duty inversions and anomalies and to provide a level playing field to the domestic industry.   "
18927,2011-12,"The major proposals are to:•reduce basic customs duty on raw silk not thrown from 30 to 5 per cent;•reduce basic customs duty from 5 per cent to 2.5 per cent on certain textile intermediates and inputs for chemicals, ferroalloys and paper;•reduce basic customs duty on certain specified inputs for manufacture of certain technical fibre and yarn from 7.5 per cent to 5 per cent;•fully exempt stainless steel scrap from basic customs duty;•reduce import duties on specified raw material for the manufacture of syringes and needles to 5 per cent basic and 4 per cent CVD;•extend the concession available to parts, components and accessories for manufacture of mobile handsets till 31st March, 2012 and to include few more items in its ambit;•expand the raw material list for manufacture of specified electronic components that are fully exempt from basic customs duty;•reduce excise duty and hence CVD on parts of inkjet and laserjet printers from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.164.Iron ore attracts an export duty of 15 per cent in the case of lumps and 5 per cent in the case of fines."
18928,2011-12,This is a natural resource which needs to be conserved.  
18929,2011-12,I propose to enhance the rate of export duty for all types of iron ore and unify it at 20 per cent ad valorem.
18930,2011-12,"Iron ore is also exported in a valueadded, pelletized form."
18931,2011-12,Full exemption from export duty is being provided to iron ore pellets to encourage the value addition process for fines.
18932,2011-12,The basic customs duty on two critical raw materials of this industry viz.
18933,2011-12,Full exemption is also being extended to parts of such machines to encourage their domestic production.      
18934,2011-12,Environment167.Full exemption from basic customs duty and a concessional rate of Central Excise duty of 4 per cent was provided to specified parts of electrical vehicles in the last Budget on actualuser basis.
18935,2011-12,I propose to extend the concession to batteries imported by such manufacturers for the replacement market.
18936,2011-12,Fuel cell or Hydrogen cell technology is a promising green technology for the automobile sector.  
18937,2011-12,I propose to extend the concessional excise duty of 10 per cent to vehicles based on this technology.169.Hybrid vehicles enjoy a concessional excise duty rate of 10 per cent.
18938,2011-12,"However, import dependence for their critical parts/ subassemblies is still quite high."
18939,2011-12,It is proposed to grant specified parts of such vehicles full exemption from basic customs duty and special CVD.
18940,2011-12,"In addition, a concessional rate of excise duty of 5 per cent is being prescribed to incentivise their domestic production.170.In response to the growing demand for green products, a technology has been developed indigenously for the conversion of fossil fuel vehicles into Hybrid vehicles through the fitment of a kit."
18941,2011-12,"I propose to reduce the excise duty on such kits and their parts from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.171.In the last Budget, Central Excise duty on LED lights was reduced from 8 per cent to 4 per cent to promote their use."
18942,2011-12,The basic component of these lights viz.
18943,2011-12,The excise duty on LEDs is being reduced to 5 per cent and special CVD is being fully exempted.172.
18944,2011-12,The solar lantern enables our countrymen in farflung villages to partake of developments in green technology.
18945,2011-12,The basic customs duty on such lanterns is being reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
18946,2011-12,Basic customs duty on a few more inputs used in the manufacture of solar modules/ cells is being reduced to Nil.173.Environmental considerations demand promotion of laundry soaps which conserve water and are gentle on the soil.
18947,2011-12,"To this end, full exemption from basic customs duty is being provided to Crude Palm Stearin for use in the manufacture of laundry soap.174.Pretanning or tanning processes in the leather industry use chemicals which are pollutants."
18948,2011-12,"To encourage use of green processes, full exemption from basic excise duty is being granted to enzyme based preparations for pretanning."
18949,2011-12,Infrastructure175.Capital goods imported for the expansion of existing mega or ultra mega power projects enjoy a concessional basic customs duty of 2.5 per cent and full exemption from CVD.
18950,2011-12,This creates a disability for the domestic suppliers who are required to pay Central Excise duty on supplies to such projects.
18951,2011-12,I propose to correct this anomaly by providing a parallel excise duty exemption.
18952,2011-12,Full exemption from basic customs duty is being extended to bioasphalt and specified machinery for its application in the construction of national highways.
18953,2011-12,Tunnelboring machines required for the construction of highways are also being included in this exemption.
18954,2011-12,Other Proposals177.Works of art and antiquities are exempt from customs duties when imported for exhibition in a public museum or national institution.
18955,2011-12,"In recent years, many organisations have joined the cause of promoting and popularising both traditional and contemporary art."
18956,2011-12,Some of them have been active in locating heritage works of Indian art and antiquities in foreign countries and bringing them back home.
18957,2011-12,"To encourage such initiatives, I propose to expand the scope of this exemption for works of art and antiquities to also apply to imports for exhibition or display, in private art galleries or similar premises that are open to the general public."
18958,2011-12,Department of Culture will notify details of the scheme separately.    
18959,2011-12,"This exemption is being extended to imports by ship owners too.179.The concessional basic customs duty of 5 per cent and CVD of 5 per cent, presently applicable to highspeed printing presses imported by newspaper establishments is being extended to mailroom equipment.180.The Indian film industry has represented that colour, unexposed jumbo rolls of cinematographic film are not manufactured domestically and have to be imported."
18960,2011-12,I propose to exempt jumbo rolls of 400 feet and 1000 feet from CVD by providing full exemption from excise duty.
18961,2011-12,A refundbased concession is available to taxis having a seating capacity not exceeding 7 persons including the driver.
18962,2011-12,"I propose to extend this to vehicles upto a seating capacity not exceeding 13 persons including the driver.182.Some of the other relief measures that I propose are:•Reduction in basic customs duty on raw pistachio from 30 per cent to 10 per cent;•Reduction in basic customs duty on bamboo for agarbatti from 30 per cent to 10 per cent;•Reduction in basic customs duty on lactose for the manufacture of homeopathic medicines from 25 per cent to 10 per cent; and•Reduction in central excise duty on sanitary napkins, baby and adult diapers from 10 per cent to 1 per cent.183.My proposals relating to customs and Central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of `7,300 crore for the year."
18963,2011-12,"While retaining the standard rate of service tax at 10 per cent, I seek to achieve a closer fit between the present service tax regime and its GST successor by:•Bringing in a few new services into the tax net to expand the tax base while ensuring that the impact is predominantly on sections of society that have the ability to pay;•Suitably expanding or rationalizing the scope of existing service categories; •Rationalizing certain provisions relating to import of services and valuation;•Modifying provisions of the Cenvat Credit scheme to achieve a more realistic balance between input credits and output tax and harmonising the provisions of the scheme across goods and services; •Rationalizing penal provisions to reinforce the message that honest taxpayers would be facilitated and deviants would be dealt with severely; and•Adoption of Point of Taxation rules for services which would shift the basis for tax collection from “cash” towards “accrual” basis as with Central Excise duty."
18964,2011-12,"Thus, the effective burden will be 3 per cent of the bill.186.I imposed service tax in 201011 on health check up or treatment."
18965,2011-12,This levy has resulted in differential treatment between persons who make payments themselves and others where payments are made by an insurance company or a business entity.  
18966,2011-12,"Thus, I propose to replace it with a tax on all services provided by hospitals with 25 or more beds that have the facility of central airconditioning."
18967,2011-12,"Though the tax is on high end treatment, I propose to sweeten the pill by an abatement of 50 per cent so that the actual burden is kept at 5 per cent of the value of service.  "
18968,2011-12,I also propose to extend the levy to diagnostic tests of all kinds with the same rate of abatement.
18969,2011-12,"However, all Government hospitals shall be outside this levy.  "
18970,2011-12,I also propose to tax travel by higher classes on domestic sector at the standard rate of 10 per cent to bring it on par with journeys by higher classes on international air travel.188.Services provided by life insurance companies in the area of investment are also proposed to be brought into tax net on the same lines as ULIPs.
18971,2011-12,I propose to expand the scope of legal services to include services provided by business entities to individuals as well as representational and arbitration services by individuals to business entities.
18972,2011-12,"There shall, however, be no tax on services provided by individuals to other individuals."
18973,2011-12,I do not wish to take the valuable time of the House in further elaboration here.
18974,2011-12,"Due to complexities, there have been many legal disputes on the availability of credit on a number of inputs or input services.  "
18975,2011-12,"These provisions are being rationalized by laying down clear definitions so that the scope of inputs and input services that are eligible and those that are not, is clear.  "
18976,2011-12,Allocation of CENVAT credit to exempt and taxable goods and services is also being streamlined.191.The number of assessees in service tax has grown manifold.  
18977,2011-12,I find that a large number of them comprise individuals or sole proprietors with small turnovers.  
18978,2011-12,Any audit at their premises tends to dislocate their activities for the duration of the audit.
18979,2011-12,"I therefore, propose to free all individual and sole proprietor taxpayers with a turnover upto `60 lakh from the formalities of audit.  "
18980,2011-12,This will give relief to a large number of  taxpayers.
18981,2011-12,"I also intend to give all assessees with turnover upto `60 lakh, the benefit of 3 percentage points in interest on delayed payment.192.In keeping with our thrust to encourage voluntary compliance, the penal provisions for Service Tax are being rationalised."
18982,2011-12,A key component of this strategy would be to treat less harshly those who have maintained truthful records but have fallen short of discharging their tax liability.
18983,2011-12,"Simultaneously, deliberate evaders with unrecorded business transactions will be dealt with more severely."
18984,2011-12,Similar changes are being carried out in Central Excise and Customs laws.
18985,2011-12,The details of the provisions are in the Finance Bill.
18986,2011-12,Such an approach will be very conducive for a nationwide GST.
18987,2011-12,"I propose to initiate an informed public debate on the subject to help us finalise the approach to GST.195.Copies of notifications giving effect to the changes in Customs, Central Excise and Service Tax will be laid on the Table of the House in due course.196.My proposals on direct taxes are estimated to result in a revenue loss of `11,500 crore for the year."
18988,2011-12,"Proposals relating to indirect taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of `11,300 crore, leaving a net loss of `200 crore in the Budget."
18989,2011-12,We must not let the recent strains and tensions hold us back from converting these possibilities into realities.
18990,2011-12,"With oneness of heart, let us all build an India, which in not too distant a future, will enter the comity of developed nations."
18991,2011-12,"Madam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
18992,2012-13,I rise to present the Union Budget for 201213.
18993,2012-13,"For the Indian economy, this was a year of recovery interrupted."
18994,2012-13,"When one year ago, I rose to present the Budget, the challenges were many, but there was a sense that the world economy was on the mend."
18995,2012-13,The Budget was presented in the first glimmer of hope.
18996,2012-13,But reality turned out to be different.
18997,2012-13,"The sovereign debt crisis in the Euro zone intensified, political turmoil in Middle East injected widespread uncertainty, crude oil prices rose, an earthquake struck Japan and the overall gloom refused to lift."
18998,2012-13,"While I believe that there should be no room for complacency, nor any excuse for what happens in one’s own country, we will be misled if we ignore the ground realities of the world."
18999,2012-13,The global crisis has affected us.
19000,2012-13,"India’s Gross Domestic Product GDP is estimated to grow by 6.9 per cent in 201112, after having grown at the rate of 8.4 per cent in each of the two preceding years."
19001,2012-13,"Though we have been able to limit the adverse impact of this slowdown on our economy, this year’s performance has been disappointing."
19002,2012-13,"But it is also a fact that in any crosscountry comparison, India still remains among the front runners in economic growth."
19003,2012-13,"For the better part of the past two years, we had to battle near double digit headline inflation."
19004,2012-13,Our monetary and fiscal policy response during this period was geared towards taming domestic inflationary pressures.
19005,2012-13,A tight monetary policy impacted investment and consumption growth.
19006,2012-13,The fiscal policy had to absorb expanded outlays on subsidies and duty reductions to limit the passthrough of higher fuel prices to consumers.
19007,2012-13,As a result growth moderated and the fiscal balance deteriorated.
19008,2012-13,But there is good news in the detail.
19009,2012-13,"With agriculture and services continuing to perform well, India’s slowdown can be attributed almost entirely to weak industrial growth."
19010,2012-13,"While we do not have aggregate figures for the last http://indiabudget.nic.in 2 quarter of 201112, numerous indicators pertaining to this period suggest that the economy is now turning around."
19011,2012-13,"There are signs of recovery in coal, fertilisers, cement and electricity sectors."
19012,2012-13,These are core sectors that have an impact on the entire economy.
19013,2012-13,Indian manufacturing appears to be on the cusp of a revival.
19014,2012-13,We are now at a juncture when it is necessary to take hard decisions.
19015,2012-13,We have to improve our macroeconomic environment and strengthen domestic growth drivers to sustain high growth in the medium term.
19016,2012-13,We have to accelerate the pace of reforms and improve supply side management of the economy.
19017,2012-13,"We are about to enter the first year of the Twelfth Five Year Plan which aims at “faster, sustainable and more inclusive growth.”"
19018,2012-13,The Plan will be launched with the Budget proposals for 201213.
19019,2012-13,"In keeping with the stated priorities, I have identified five objectives that we must address effectively in the ensuing fiscal year."
19020,2012-13,"These are: Focus on domestic demand driven growth recovery; Create conditions for rapid revival of high growth in private investment; Address supply bottlenecks in agriculture, energy and transport sectors, particularly in coal, power, national highways, railways and civil aviation; Intervene decisively to address the problem of malnutrition especially in the 200 highburden districts; and Expedite coordinated implementation of decisions being taken to improve delivery systems, governance, and transparency; and address the problem of black money and corruption in public life."
19021,2012-13,"Today, India has global responsibilities of a kind that it did not have earlier."
19022,2012-13,Our presence at the high table of global economic policy makers is a matter of some satisfaction.
19023,2012-13,"It, however, places new responsibilities on our shoulders."
19024,2012-13,"If India can continue to build on its economic strength, it can be a source of stability for the world economy and provide a safe destination for restless global capital."
19025,2012-13,I know that mere words are not enough.
19026,2012-13,What we need is a credible roadmap backed by a set of implementable proposals to meet those objectives.
19027,2012-13,"In my attempt to do so, I have benefited from the able guidance of Hon’ble Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, and strong support of the UPA Chairperson Smt."
19028,2012-13,Overview of the Economy 9.
19029,2012-13,"Yesterday, I laid on the table of the House the Economic Survey 201112, which gives a detailed analysis of the economy over the past 12 months."
19030,2012-13,India’s GDP is estimated to grow at 6.9 per cent in real terms in 201112.
19031,2012-13,"The growth is estimated to be 2.5 per cent in agriculture, 3.9 per cent in industry and 9.4 per cent in services."
19032,2012-13,"There is a significant slowdown in comparison to the preceding two years, primarily due to deceleration in industrial growth, more specifically in private investment."
19033,2012-13,"Rising cost of credit and weak domestic business sentiment, added to this decline."
19034,2012-13,The headline inflation remained high for most part of the year.
19035,2012-13,It was only in December 2011 that it moderated to 8.3 per cent followed by 6.6 per cent in January 2012.
19036,2012-13,"Monthly food inflation declined from 20.2 per cent in February 2010, to 9.4 per cent in March 2011 and turned negative in January 2012."
19037,2012-13,"Though the February 2012 inflation figure has gone up marginally, I expect the headline inflation to moderate further in the next few months and remain stable thereafter."
19038,2012-13,"India’s inflation is largely structural, driven predominantly by agricultural supply constraints and global cost push."
19039,2012-13,Evidence suggests that prolonged periods of high food inflation tend to get generalised.
19040,2012-13,"Fortunately, steps taken to bridge gaps in distribution, storage and marketing systems to strengthen food supply chains have helped us in a more effective management of inflation and led to a decline in food inflation."
19041,2012-13,The developments in India’s external trade in the first half of the current year were encouraging.
19042,2012-13,"During AprilJanuary 201112, exports grew by 23 per cent to reach US Dollar 243 billion, while imports at US Dollar 391 billion recorded a growth of over 29 per cent."
19043,2012-13,What is heartening is that India has successfully achieved diversification of export and import markets.
19044,2012-13,"The share of Asia, including ASEAN, in total trade increased from 33.3 per cent in 20002001 to 57.3 per cent in the first half of 201112."
19045,2012-13,This has helped us weather the impact of global crisis emanating from Europe and to a lesser extent from USA. 13.
19046,2012-13,The current account deficit as a proportion of GDP for 201112 is likely to be around 3.6 per cent.
19047,2012-13,"This, along with reduced net capital inflows in the second and third quarters, put pressure on the exchange rate."
19048,2012-13,"Taking a bird’s eye view of the entire economy and keeping in mind the difficult global environment, I expect India’s GDP growth in 201213 to be 7.6 per cent, +/ 0.25 per cent."
19049,2012-13,I expect average inflation to be lower next year.
19050,2012-13,"I also expect the current account deficit to be smaller, aided by improvement in domestic financial savings."
19051,2012-13,Growth I now turn to growth and fiscal consolidation.
19052,2012-13,Our fiscal balance has deteriorated in 201112 due to slippage in direct tax revenue and increased subsidies.
19053,2012-13,On both counts our underlying assumptions at the time of Budget presentation last year were belied by subsequent developments.
19054,2012-13,The profit margins came under pressure due to higher interest rates and material costs.
19055,2012-13,This impacted growth in corporate taxes.
19056,2012-13,"Further, as against an assumption of US Dollar 90 a barrel, the average price of crude oil in 201112 is likely to exceed US Dollar 115."
19057,2012-13,This has necessitated higher outlay on subsidies than projected.
19058,2012-13,The continuing uncertainty in the global environment makes it necessary for us to strike a balance between fiscal consolidation and strengthening macroeconomic fundamentals to create adequate headroom to deal with future shocks.
19059,2012-13,Fiscal Consolidation FRBM Act 17.
19060,2012-13,"The implementation of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act, 2003 FRBM Act at Centre and the corresponding Acts at State level was the pivot in the successful consolidation of our fiscal balance prior to the global financial crisis of 2008."
19061,2012-13,The outbreak of the crisis coincided with the year when the mandated targets of 3 per cent fiscal deficit and elimination of revenue deficit were to be achieved.
19062,2012-13,The Government had to deviate from these targets due to injection of fiscal stimulus at that time.
19063,2012-13,"Following my announcement in the last Budget Speech, I am now introducing amendments to the FRBM Act as part of Finance Bill, 2012."
19064,2012-13,The fiscal targets for Centre under the amendments to the FRBM Act are indicated in the Budget documents.
19065,2012-13,"Meanwhile, I would like to highlight two of its features that are steps in the direction of expenditure reforms."
19066,2012-13,"First, the concept of Effective Revenue Deficit, introduced in the last Budget, to address the structural imbalances in the revenue account, is being brought in as a fiscal parameter."
19067,2012-13,Effective Revenue Deficit is the difference between revenue deficit and grants for creation of capital assets.
19068,2012-13,Focusing on this will help in reducing the consumptive component of revenue deficit and create space for increased capital spending.
19069,2012-13,"Second, a provision for “Mediumterm Expenditure Framework Statement” is being introduced in the Act."
19070,2012-13,This statement shall set forth a three year rolling target for expenditure indicators.
19071,2012-13,It would help in undertaking a de novo exercise for allocating resources for prioritised schemes and weeding out others that have outlived their utility.
19072,2012-13,This would provide greater certainty in multiyear budgeting framework.
19073,2012-13,It would also encourage efficiencies in expenditure management.
19074,2012-13,"In implementing the Twelfth Plan, the recommendations made by the Expert Committees to streamline and reduce the number of Centrally Sponsored Schemes and to address Plan and nonPlan classification, would be kept in view."
19075,2012-13,The Central Plan Scheme Monitoring System would be expanded to facilitate better tracking and utilisation of funds released by the Central Government.
19076,2012-13,Fiscal consolidation calls for efforts both to raise the taxGDP ratio and to lower the expenditure.
19077,2012-13,"In this context, we need to take a close look at the growth of our revenue expenditure, particularly on subsidies."
19078,2012-13,"The major subsidies at the Centre are for food, fertilisers and petroleum products."
19079,2012-13,Some subsidies at this juncture in our development are inevitable.
19080,2012-13,"But they become undesirable if they compromise the macroeconomic fundamentals of the economy, more so, when they don’t reach the intended beneficiaries."
19081,2012-13,The Government has decided that from 201213 subsidies related to food and for administering the Food Security Act will be fully provided for.
19082,2012-13,All other subsidies would be funded to the extent that they can be borne by the economy without any adverse implications.
19083,2012-13,It would be my endeavour to restrict the expenditure on Central subsidies to under 2 per cent of GDP in 201213.
19084,2012-13,"Over the next three years, it would be further brought down to 1.75 per cent of GDP."
19085,2012-13,Such a step is needed to improve the quality of public spending.
19086,2012-13,Our effort now will be directed towards better targeting and leakage proof delivery of the subsidies.
19087,2012-13,The recommendations of the task force headed by Shri Nandan Nilekani on IT strategy for direct transfer of subsidy have been accepted.
19088,2012-13,"Based on these recommendations, a mobile based Fertiliser Management System mFMS has been designed to provide endtoend information on the movement of fertilisers and subsidies, from the manufacturer to the retail level."
19089,2012-13,This will be rolled out nationwide during 2012.
19090,2012-13,"Direct transfer of subsidy to the retailer, and eventually to the farmer will be implemented in subsequent phases."
19091,2012-13,"This step will benefit 12 crore farmer families, while reducing expenditure on subsidies by curtailing misuse of fertilisers."
19092,2012-13,All the three public sector Oil Marketing Companies have launched LPG transparency portals to improve customer service and reduce leakage.
19093,2012-13,A pilot project for selling LPG at market price and reimbursement of subsidy directly into the beneficiary’s bank account is being conducted in Mysore.
19094,2012-13,A similar pilot project on direct transfer of subsidy for kerosene into the bank accounts of beneficiaries has been initiated in Alwar district of Rajasthan.
19095,2012-13,The Aadhaar platform has also been successfully used to validate PDS ration cards in Jharkhand.
19096,2012-13,These pilot projects show that substantial economies in subsidy outgo can be achieved by the use of Aadhaar platform.
19097,2012-13,It will be our endeavour to scale up and roll out these Aadhaar enabled payments for various government schemes in at least 50 selected districts within the next six months.
19098,2012-13,"As Hon’ble Members are aware, the Direct Taxes Code DTC Bill was introduced in Parliament in August 2010."
19099,2012-13,"It was our earnest desire to give effect to DTC from April 1, 2012."

19101,2012-13,We will examine the report expeditiously and take steps for the enactment of DTC at the earliest. 27.
19102,2012-13,"Similarly, the Constitution Amendment Bill, a preparatory step in the implementation of Goods and Services Tax GST was introduced in Parliament in March 2011 and is before the Parliamentary Standing Committee."

19105,2012-13,GSTN will be set up as a National Information Utility and will become operational by August 2012.
19106,2012-13,"The GSTN will implement common PANbased registration, returns filing and payments processing for all States on a shared platform."
19107,2012-13,"The use of PAN as a common identifier in both direct and indirect taxes, will enhance transparency and check tax evasion."
19108,2012-13,I solicit the support of all my colleagues cutting across party lines for an early passage of these landmark legislations.
19109,2012-13,The Government has further evolved its approach to divestment of Central Public Sector Enterprises CPSEs.
19110,2012-13,The CPSEs are being given a level playing field visavis the private sector with regard to practices like buybacks and listing at stock exchange.
19111,2012-13,The treasury management options for CPSEs have also been enhanced.
19112,2012-13,"This will help improve the returns on public assets, support transparent environment for the divestment process, besides unlocking the value and resources for all stakeholders."
19113,2012-13,"In 201112, as against a target of ` 40,000 crore, the Government will raise about ` 14,000 crore from disinvestment."
19114,2012-13,"For 201213, I propose to raise ` 30,000 crore through disinvestment."
19115,2012-13,"Let me reiterate here that while we are committed to enhancing people’s ownership of CPSEs, at least 51 per cent ownership and management control will remain with the Government."
19116,2012-13,The domestic investment environment has suffered on multiple counts in the past year.
19117,2012-13,It is time to fast track policy decisions and ensure ontime implementation of major projects.

19587,2012-13,I also propose to carry out a nominal increase in basic excise duty on handrolled bidis from `8 to `10 per thousand and on machinerolled bidis from `19 to `21 per thousand.
19588,2012-13,The existing exemption available to handrolled bidis for clearances up to 20 lakh bidis per annum is being retained.
19589,2012-13,"Pan masala, gutkha, chewing tobacco, unmanufactured tobacco and zarda scented tobacco in pouches are leviable to excise duty under the compounded levy scheme."
19590,2012-13,The rates of duty specified per packing machine for these items are being stepped up taking into account improvements in the efficiency of machines used by this industry.
19591,2012-13,"Crude petroleum oil produced in India attracts a cess of `2,500 per metric tonne under the Oil Industries Development Act."
19592,2012-13,This rate was last revised in Budget 200607.
19593,2012-13,"As a measure of indexation, I propose to increase the rate of cess to `4,500 per metric tonne."
19594,2012-13,"Completely Built Units of large cars/ MUVs/ SUVs having engine capacity above a prescribed threshold and whose value exceeds US dollar 40,000 per vehicle are permitted for import without type approval."
19595,2012-13,Basic customs duty on such vehicles is being enhanced from 60 per cent to 75 per cent ad valorem.
19596,2012-13,"Packaged cement, whether manufactured by minicement plants or others, attracts differential excise duty depending on the Retail Sale Price per bag."
19597,2012-13,It is proposed to prescribe a unified rate of 12 per cent + `120 PMT for nonmini cement plants and 6 per cent + `120 PMT for minicement plants.
19598,2012-13,It is proposed to charge this duty on the Retail Sale Price less abatement of 30 per cent.
19599,2012-13,The House would recall that I had reintroduced a levy of excise duty of 1 per cent on branded precious metal jewellery in the last Budget.
19600,2012-13,"As a measure of rationalisation, I propose to include jewellery, not bearing a brand name, under its ambit."
19601,2012-13,"However, to simplify its operation and minimise its impact on small artisans and goldsmiths, I propose: • to charge this duty on tariff value equal to 30 per cent of the transaction value; • to extend smallscale exemption up to annual turnover not exceeding `1.5 crore for units having a turnover below ` 4 crore in the previous year; • to compute turnover on the basis of tariff value; and • to place the onus of registration and payment on the person who gets jewellery manufactured on jobwork."
19602,2012-13,I propose to fully exempt branded silver jewellery from excise duty.
19603,2012-13,Building of commercial vehicle bodies is currently exempt from excise duty.
19604,2012-13,"In lieu of this duty, a specific rate of `10,000 is being charged on chassis in addition to the applicable ad valorem duty."
19605,2012-13,This duty structure is regressive.
19606,2012-13,It is proposed to convert the specific component of duty to an ad valorem rate of 3 per cent.
19607,2012-13,"In the last Budget, excise duty exemption on ships and vessels including dredgers was withdrawn."
19608,2012-13,"Accordingly, CVD of 5 per cent became leviable on their imports."
19609,2012-13,"As the intention was not to levy this duty on the import of foreign going vessels, I propose to exempt such vessels from CVD retrospectively."
19610,2012-13,Baggage allowance for Indians travelling abroad was last revised in 2004.
19611,2012-13,"I propose to increase the dutyfree allowance for eligible passengers of Indian origin from `25,000 to `35,000 and for children of up to 10 years from `12,000 to `15,000. 218."
19612,2012-13,"My proposals relating to Customs and Central excise are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of ` 27,280 crore for a full year."
19613,2012-13,My proposals on Direct Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue loss of `4500 crore for the year.
19614,2012-13,"Proposals relating to Indirect Taxes are estimated to result in a net revenue gain of `45,940 crore, leaving a net gain of `41,440 crore in the Budget."
19615,2012-13,"For the Indian economy, this was a challenging year."
19616,2012-13,A number of global and domestic factors militated against the growth that had revived in the last two years.
19617,2012-13,But India has thrived under challenges and India will do so now.
19618,2012-13,"In the middle of every crisis, there is also an opportunity."
19619,2012-13,"It is an opportunity to re think, reassess and make way for new ideas and policies."
19620,2012-13,It is in this spirit that I approached the Budget of this year.
19621,2012-13,"The aim is to create an enabling atmosphere for corporates, farmers, entrepreneurs and workers to take initiatives for robust growth."
19622,2012-13,The aim is also to ensure that the benefits of growth reach all sections of population.
19623,2012-13,India stands on the brink of a major resurgence.
19624,2012-13,"Whether or not today’s announcements make tomorrow morning’s headlines matters little, as long as they help in shaping the headlines that describe India a decade from now."
19625,2012-13,"Madam Speaker, with these words, I commend the Budget to the House."
19626,2013-14,I rise to present the Budget for the year 201314.
19627,2013-14,I recall my last tenure as Finance Minister and acknowledge with gratitude the splendid support that I received from all sections of the House as well as the people of India.
19628,2013-14,"Today, more than ever, I seek the same support as we navigate the Indian economy through a crisis that has enveloped the whole world and spared none."
19629,2013-14,"I intend to keep my speech simple, straight forward and reasonably short."
19630,2013-14,I. THE ECONOMY AND THE CHALLENGES 4.
19631,2013-14,I shall begin by setting the context.
19632,2013-14,Global economic growth slowed from 3.9 percent in 2011 to 3.2 percent in 2012.
19633,2013-14,India is part of the global economy: our exports and imports amount to 43 percent of GDP and twoway external sector transactions have risen to 108 percent of GDP.
19634,2013-14,We are not unaffected by what happens in the rest of the world and our economy too has slowed after 201011.
19635,2013-14,"In the current year, the CSO has estimated growth at 5 percent while the RBI has estimated growth at 5.5 percent."
19636,2013-14,"Whatever may be the final estimate, it will be below India’s potential growth rate of 8 percent."
19637,2013-14,Getting back to that growth rate is the challenge that faces the country.
19638,2013-14,"Even now, of the large countries of the world, only China and Indonesia are growing faster than India in 201213."
19639,2013-14,"And in 201314, if we grow at the rate projected by many forecasters, only China will grow faster than India."
19640,2013-14,"Between 2004 and 2008, and again in 200910 and 201011, the growth rate was over 8 percent and, in fact, crossed 9 percent in four of those six years."
19641,2013-14,"The average for the 11th Plan period, entirely under the UPA Government, was 8 percent, the highest ever in any Plan period."
19642,2013-14,"Achieving high growth, therefore, is not a novelty or beyond our capacity."
19643,2013-14,We have done it before and we can do it again.
19644,2013-14,"I acknowledge that the Indian economy is challenged, but I am absolutely confident that, with your cooperation, we will get out of the trough and get on to the high growth path."
19645,2013-14,I shall now outline our plans and priorities.
19646,2013-14,That is the mool mantra. 8.
19647,2013-14,Growth is a necessary condition and we must unhesitatingly embrace growth as the highest goal.
19648,2013-14,"It is growth that will lead to inclusive development, without growth there will be neither development nor inclusiveness."
19649,2013-14,"However, I may sound a note of caution."
19650,2013-14,"Owing to the plurality and diversity of India, and centuries of neglect, discrimination and deprivation, many sections of the people will be left behind if we do not pay special attention to them."
19651,2013-14,"As Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel prizewinning economist, said, “There is a compelling moral case for equity; but it is also necessary if there is to be sustained growth."
19652,2013-14,A country’s most important resource is its people.”
19653,2013-14,"We have examples of States growing at a fast rate, but leaving behind women, the scheduled castes, the scheduled tribes, the minorities, and some backward classes."
19654,2013-14,The UPA does not accept that model.
19655,2013-14,"The UPA Government believes in inclusive development, with emphasis on improving human development indicators."
19656,2013-14,I hope this Budget will be yet another testimony to that commitment.
19657,2013-14,"Fiscal Deficit, Current Account Deficit and Inflation9."
19658,2013-14,The purpose of a Budget – and the job of a Finance Minister – is to create the economic space and find the resources to achieve the socio economic objectives.
19659,2013-14,"At present, the economic space is constrained because of a high fiscal deficit; reliance on foreign inflows to finance the current account deficit; lower savings and lower investment; a tight monetary policy to contain inflation; and strong external headwinds."
19660,2013-14,"During the course of my speech, I shall spell out measures that will address each of these issues."
19661,2013-14,"In September, 2012, Government accepted the main recommendations of the Dr. Vijay Kelkar Committee."
19662,2013-14,A new fiscal consolidation path was announced.
19663,2013-14,Red lines were drawn for the fiscal deficit at 5.3 percent of GDP this year and 4.8 percent of GDP in 201314.
19664,2013-14,I know there is a lot of scepticism.
19665,2013-14,"In a little while, I shall tell you how we have fared."
19666,2013-14,My greater worry is the current account deficit CAD.
19667,2013-14,"The CAD continues to be high mainly because of our excessive dependence on oil imports, the high volume of coal imports, our passion for gold, and the slow down in exports."
19668,2013-14,"This year, and perhaps next year too, we have to find over USD 75 billion to finance the CAD."
19669,2013-14,"There are only three ways before us: FDI, FII or External Commercial Borrowing ECB."
19670,2013-14,"That is why I have been at pains to state over and over again that India, at the present juncture, does not have the choice between welcoming and spurning foreign investment."
19671,2013-14,"If I may be frank, foreign investment is an imperative."
19672,2013-14,What we can do is to encourage foreign investment that is consistent with our economic objectives.
19673,2013-14,"Finally, the development must be sustainable – economically and ecologically."
19674,2013-14,The development model must have democratic legitimacy and approval.
19675,2013-14,Looming large over our efforts to stimulate growth is inflation.
19676,2013-14,"Supply demand mismatch, for example in oilseeds and pulses, also pushes up inflation."
19677,2013-14,Aggregate demand is another cause of inflation.
19678,2013-14,The battle against inflation must be fought on all fronts.
19679,2013-14,Our efforts in the past few months have brought down headline WPI inflation to about 7.0 percent and core inflation to about 4.2 percent.
19680,2013-14,"It is food inflation that is worrying, and we shall take all possible steps to augment the supply side to meet the growing demand for food items."
19681,2013-14,Government expenditure boosts aggregate demand and it has both good and bad consequences.
19682,2013-14,Wisdom lies in finding the correct level of government expenditure.
19683,2013-14,"In the budget for 201213, the estimate of Plan Expenditure was too ambitious and the estimate of nonPlan Expenditure was too conservative."
19684,2013-14,"Faced with a huge fiscal deficit, I had no choice but to rationalise expenditure."
19685,2013-14,We took a dose of bitter medicine.
19686,2013-14,It seems to be working.
19687,2013-14,"We also took some policy decisions that had been deferred for too long, corrected some prices, and undertook a review of certain tax policies."
19688,2013-14,We have retrieved some economic space.
19689,2013-14,"As I outline our plans and priorities, Hon’ble Members will find that I have used that economic space to advantage – and to advance the UPA Government’s socioeconomic objectives."
19690,2013-14,The 12th Five Year Plan began in 201213.
19691,2013-14,"Anticipating a global and domestic recovery, total expenditure had been fixed at `14,90,925 crore."
19692,2013-14,"Due to the slowdown and the austerity measures, the revised estimate is `14,30,825 crore or 96 percent of the budget estimate."
19693,2013-14,The economic space that we have gained has given me the confidence to be more ambitious in 201314.
19694,2013-14,"I have been able to set the BE of total expenditure at `16,65,297 crore and of plan expenditure at `5,55,322 crore."
19695,2013-14,Hon’ble Members will be happy to know that plan expenditure in 201314 will be 29.4 percent more than the revised estimate of the current year.
19696,2013-14,All flagship programmes have been fully and adequately funded.
19697,2013-14,IdaresayIhaveprovidedsufficientfundstoeachMinistryorDepartment consistent with their capacity to spend the funds.
19698,2013-14,"Now, it is over to the Ministries and Departments to deliver the outcomes through good governance, prudent cash management, close monitoring and timely implementation."
19699,2013-14,"Madam Speaker, on the one side is economic policy."
19700,2013-14,On the other side is economic welfare.
19701,2013-14,We are a developing country.
19702,2013-14,"The link between policy and welfare can be expressed in a few words: opportunities, education, skills, jobs and incomes."
19703,2013-14,Every young man and woman understands this.
19704,2013-14,My budget for 201314 has before it one overarching goal: to create opportunities for our youth to acquire education and skills that will get 4 them decent jobs or selfemployment that will bring them adequate incomes that will enable them to live with their families in a safe and secure environment.
19705,2013-14,"SC, ST, Women and Children 17."
19706,2013-14,Let me assure Hon’ble Members that their concerns are my concerns too.
19707,2013-14,I know their concern for the welfare and progress of the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes for whom the Budget has sub plans.
19708,2013-14,"I also know their concern that adequate funds must be provided for programmes that benefit women, children and the minorities."
19709,2013-14,I have tried to meet these concerns as fully as possible.
19710,2013-14,"I propose to allocate `41,561 crore to the scheduled caste sub plan and `24,598 crore to the tribal sub plan."
19711,2013-14,The total represents an increase of 12.5 percent over the BE and 31 percent over the RE of the current year.
19712,2013-14,I reiterate the rule that the funds allocated to the sub plans cannot be diverted and must be spent for the purposes of the sub plans.
19713,2013-14,I have made sufficient allocations to programmes relating to women and children.
19714,2013-14,"Hon’ble Members will find from the budget documents that the gender budget has `97,134 crore and the child budget has `77,236 crore in 201314."
19715,2013-14,"Women belonging to the most vulnerable groups, including single women and widows, must be able to live with selfesteem and dignity."
19716,2013-14,"Young women face gender discrimination everywhere, especially at the work place."
19717,2013-14,Ministry of Women and Child Development has been asked to design schemes that will address these concerns.
19718,2013-14,I propose to provide an additional sum of `200 crore to that Ministry to begin work in this regard.
19719,2013-14,"I have allocated `3,511 crore to the Ministry of Minority Affairs."
19720,2013-14,This is an increase of 12 percent over the BE and 60 percent over the RE of 201213.
19721,2013-14,The Maulana Azad Education Foundation is the main vehicle to implement educational schemes and channelize funds to nongovernment organisations for the minorities.
19722,2013-14,Its corpus stands at `750 crore.
19723,2013-14,"With the objective of raising it to `1,500 crore during the 12th Plan period, I propose to allocate `160 crore to the corpus fund."
19724,2013-14,The Foundation wishes to add medical aid to its objectives.
19725,2013-14,I have accepted that a beginning can be made by providing medical facilities such as an infirmary or a resident doctor in the educational institutions run or funded by the Foundation.

19975,2013-14,"However, despite cost advantages in labour, land and construction, the consumer pays a high price for renewable energy."
19976,2013-14,One of the reasons is high cost of finance.
19977,2013-14,"In order to provide low cost finance, Government will provide low interest bearing funds from the National Clean Energy Fund NCEF to IREDA to onlend to viable renewable energy projects."
19978,2013-14,The scheme will have a life span of five years.

20058,2013-14,"Non Plan Expenditure is estimated at `11,09,975 crore."
20059,2013-14,"When we accepted the main recommendations of the Kelkar report, I had drawn some red lines and promised that I would not cross those lines."

20064,2013-14,"When I took over in August, 2012, I made a statement that “clarity in tax laws, a stable tax regime, a nonadversarial tax administration, a fair mechanism for dispute resolution, and an independent judiciary will provide great assurance”."
20065,2013-14,"That statement is the underlying theme of my tax proposals, both on the direct taxes side and on the indirect taxes side."
20066,2013-14,An emerging economy must have a tax system that reflects best global practices.

20069,2013-14,These ratios are one of the lowest for any large developing country and will not garner adequate resources for inclusive and sustainable development.
20070,2013-14,"I may recall that in 200708, the tax GDP ratio touched a peak of 11.9 percent."
20071,2013-14,"In the short term, we must reclaim that peak."

20075,2013-14,"It is a time for prudence, restraint and patience."
20076,2013-14,The rates of personal income tax have survived four Finance Ministers and four Governments.
20077,2013-14,The current slabs were introduced only last year.
20078,2013-14,"Hence, I am afraid, there is no case to revise either the slabs or the rates."
20079,2013-14,"Besides, even a moderate increase in the level of threshold exemption will mean that hundreds of thousands of tax payers will go out of the tax net and the tax base will be severely eroded."
20080,2013-14,"Nevertheless, I am inclined to give some relief to the tax payers in the first bracket of `2 lakh to `5 lakh."
20081,2013-14,"Assuming an inflation rate of 10 percent and a notional rise in the threshold exemption from `2,00,000 to `2,20,000, I propose to provide a tax credit of `2,000 to every person who has a total income upto `5 lakh."

20090,2013-14,"In the case of foreign companies, who pay the higher rate of corporate tax, the surcharge will increase from 2 percent to 5 percent."
20091,2013-14,"In all other cases, such as dividend distribution tax or tax on distributed income, I propose to increase the current surcharge of 5 percent to 10 percent."
20092,2013-14,"The additional surcharges will be in force for only one year, that is Financial Year 201314."
20093,2013-14,I believe there is a little bit of the spirit of Mr. Azim Premji in every affluent tax payer.

20098,2013-14,"If the limit is not exhausted, the balance may be claimed in AY 201516."
20099,2013-14,"This deduction will be over and above the deduction of `150,000 allowed for selfoccupied properties under section 24 of the Incometax Act."
20100,2013-14,I propose to relax the eligibility conditions of life insurance policies for persons suffering from disability or certain ailments by increasing the permissible premium rate from 10 percent to 15 percent of the sum assured.

20109,2013-14,"Further, the Indian company shall not be liable to pay dividend distribution tax on the distribution to its shareholders of that portion of the income received from its foreign subsidiary."
20110,2013-14,"With a view to attract investment in long term infrastructure bonds in foreign currency, the rate of tax on interest paid to nonresident investors was reduced last year from 20 percent to 5 percent."
20111,2013-14,I propose to extend the same benefit to investment made through a designated bank account in rupee denominated long term infrastructure bonds.

20118,2013-14,Venture Capital Funds have been allowed pass through status under the Incometax Act.
20119,2013-14,The relevant regulations of SEBI have been replaced by Alternative Investment Fund Regulations.

20121,2013-14,Angel Investors who are recognised as category I AIF venture capital funds will also get pass through status.

20123,2013-14,Transactions in immovable properties are usually undervalued and underreported.
20124,2013-14,Onehalf of the transactions do not carry the PAN of the parties concerned.

20130,2013-14,Another case is the distribution of profits by a subsidiary to a foreign parent company in the form of royalty.
20131,2013-14,"Besides, the rate of tax on royalty in the Incometax Act is lower than the rates provided in a number of Double Tax Avoidance Agreements."
20132,2013-14,This is an anomaly that must be corrected.
20133,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to increase the rate of tax on payments by way of royalty and fees for technical services to nonresidents from 10 percent to 25 percent."

20139,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to levy CTT on nonagricultural commodities futures contracts at the same rate as on equity futures, that is at 0.01 percent of the price of the trade."
20140,2013-14,Trading in commodity derivatives will not be considered as a ‘speculative transaction’ and CTT shall be allowed as deduction if the income from such transaction forms part of business income.

20166,2013-14,"To encourage manufacture of environmentfriendly vehicles, I propose to extend the period of concession now available for specified parts of electric and hybrid vehicles upto 31.3.2015."

20170,2013-14,Export duty on deoiled rice bran oil cake has made our exports uncompetitive.
20171,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to withdraw the said duty."
20172,2013-14,Prices of unprocessed ilmenite have gone up several fold in the export market.
20173,2013-14,"Considering the need to conserve our natural resources, I propose to impose a duty of 10 percent on export of unprocessed ilmenite and 5 percent on export of upgraded ilmenite."
20174,2013-14,"The aircraft manufacture, repair and overhaul MRO industry is at a nascent stage."
20175,2013-14,Encouraging the MRO sector will generate employment besides other benefits.
20176,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to provide certain concessions to the MRO industry, details of which are in the budget documents."
20177,2013-14,"To encourage domestic production of set top boxes as well as value addition, I propose to increase the duty from 5 percent to 10 percent."

20179,2013-14,Steam coal is exempt from customs duty but attracts a concessional CVD of one percent.
20180,2013-14,Bituminous coal attracts a duty of 5 percent and CVD of 6 percent.
20181,2013-14,"Since both kinds of coal are used in thermal power stations, there is rampant misclassification."
20182,2013-14,I propose to equalise the duties on both kinds of coal and levy 2 percent customs duty and 2 percent CVD.
20183,2013-14,"There is an affluent class in India that consumes imported luxury goods such as high end motor vehicles, motorcycles, yachts and similar vessels."
20184,2013-14,I am sure they will not mind paying a little more.
20185,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to increase the duty on such motor vehicles from 75 percent to 100 percent; on motorcycles with engine capacity of 800cc or more from 60 percent to 75 percent; and on yachts and similar vessels from 10 percent to 25 percent."
20186,2013-14,The baggage rules permitting eligible passengers to bring jewellery was last amended in 1991.
20187,2013-14,"Gold prices have risen since, and passengers have complained of harrasment."
20188,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to raise the dutyfree limit to `50,000 in the case of a male passenger and `100,000 in the case of a female passenger, subject to the usual conditions."
20189,2013-14,"Next, I shall deal with excise duties."
20190,2013-14,The readymade garment industry is in the throes of a crisis.
20191,2013-14,The industry needs a lifeline.
20192,2013-14,"There is a demand to restore the ‘zero excise duty route’ for cottonandmanmadesectorspunyarnattheyarn,fabricandgarmentstages."
20193,2013-14,I 28 propose to accept the demand.
20194,2013-14,"In the case of cotton, there will be zero duty at the fibre stage also and, in the case of spun yarn, there will be a duty of 12 percent at the fibre stage."
20195,2013-14,The ‘zero excise duty route’ will be in addition to the CENVAT route now available.
20196,2013-14,I propose to totally exempt handmade carpets and textile floor coverings of coir or jute from excise duty.
20197,2013-14,"As a measure of relief to the ship building industry, I propose to exempt ships and vessels from excise duty."
20198,2013-14,"Consequently, there will be no CVD on imported ships and vessels."
20199,2013-14,What does a Finance Minister turn to when he requires resources?
20200,2013-14,I propose to increase the specific excise duty on cigarettes by about 18 percent.
20201,2013-14,"Similar increases are proposed on cigars, cheroots and cigarillos."
20202,2013-14,SUVs occupy greater road and parking space and ought to bear a higher tax.
20203,2013-14,I propose to increase the excise duty on SUVs from 27 percent to 30 percent.
20204,2013-14,"However, the increase will not apply to SUVs registered as taxis."
20205,2013-14,The excise duty rate on marble was fixed in 1996.
20206,2013-14,"Keeping in view the increase in prices of marble, I propose to increase the duty from `30 per sq. mtr to ` 60 per sq mtr."
20207,2013-14,"I propose to levy 4 percent excise duty on silver manufactured from smelting zinc or lead, to bring the rate on par with the excise duty applicable to silver obtained from copper ores and concentrates."
20208,2013-14,About 70 percent of imported mobile phones and about 60 percent of domestically manufactured mobile phones are priced at `2000 or below.
20209,2013-14,Mobile phones enjoy a concessional excise duty of one percent and I do not propose to change that in the case of low priced mobile phones.
20210,2013-14,"However, on mobile phones priced at more than `2000, I propose to raise the duty to 6 percent."
20211,2013-14,"To reduce valuation disputes, I propose to provide for MRP based assessment in respect of branded medicaments of Ayurveda, Unani, Siddha, Homeopathy and biochemic systems of medicine."
20212,2013-14,There will be an abatement of 35 percent.
20213,2013-14,"As regards service tax, I have only a few proposals."
20214,2013-14,The negative list became effective after the last Budget.
20215,2013-14,Stability in the tax regime is important.
20216,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to include only two services which deserve to be in the negative list."
20217,2013-14,They are vocational courses offered by institutes affiliated to the State Council of Vocational Training and testing activities in relation to agriculture and agricultural produce.
20218,2013-14,"Last year, at the request of the film industry, full exemption of service tax was granted on copyright on cinematography."
20219,2013-14,The industry has now requested to limit the benefit of exemption to films exhibited in cinema halls.
20220,2013-14,I propose to accept the request.
20221,2013-14,"At present, service tax does not apply to air conditioned restaurants that do not serve liquor."
20222,2013-14,"The distinction is artificial, and I propose to levy service tax on all air conditioned restaurants."
20223,2013-14,"Homes and flats with a carpet area of 2,000 sq.ft."
20224,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to reduce the rate of abatement for this class of buildings from 75 percent to 70 percent."
20225,2013-14,Existing exemptions from service tax for low cost housing and single residential units will continue.
20226,2013-14,"While there are nearly 17,00,000 registered assessees under service tax, only about 7,00,000 file returns."
20227,2013-14,Many have simply stopped filing returns.
20228,2013-14,We cannot go after each of them.
20229,2013-14,I have to motivate them to file returns and pay the tax dues.
20230,2013-14,"Hence, I propose to introduce a onetime scheme called ‘Voluntary Compliance Encouragement Scheme’."
20231,2013-14,A defaulter may avail of the scheme on condition that he files a truthful declaration of service tax dues since 1.10.2007 and makes the payment in one or two instalments before prescribed dates.
20232,2013-14,"In such a case, interest, penalty and other consequences will be waived."
20233,2013-14,I hope to entice a large number of assessees to return to the tax fold.
20234,2013-14,I also hope to collect a reasonable sum of money.
20235,2013-14,There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of revenue.
20236,2013-14,They are reflected in the budget documents.
20237,2013-14,"My tax proposals on the direct taxes side are estimated to yield `13,300 crore and on the indirect taxes side `4,700 crore."
20238,2013-14,Goods and Services Tax 186.
20239,2013-14,Hon’ble Members will recall that I had first mentioned the Goods and Services Tax GST in the Budget speech for 200708.
20240,2013-14,"At that time, it was thought that GST could be brought into effect from 1.4.2010."
20241,2013-14,"Alas, that was not to be, although all States swear by the benefit of GST."
20242,2013-14,"However, my recent meetings with the Empowered Committee of State Finance Ministers has led me to believe that the State Governments – or, at least, the overwhelming majority – are agreed that there is need for a Constitutional amendment; there is need for State Governments and the Central Government to pass a GST law that will be drafted by the State Finance Ministers and the GST Council; and there is need for the Centre to compensate the States for loss due to the reduction in the CST rate."
20243,2013-14,I hope we can take this consensus forward in the next few months and bring to this House a draft Bill on the Constitutional amendment and a draft Bill 30 on GST.
20244,2013-14,"I propose to take the first decisive step by setting apart, in the Budget, a sum of `9,000 crore towards the first instalment of the balance of CST compensation."
20245,2013-14,I appeal to the State Finance Ministers to realise the serious intent of the Government to introduce GST and come forward to work with the Government and bring about a transformational change in the tax structure of the country.
20246,2013-14,"Madam Speaker, the last day of February is another day in the life of a nation."
20247,2013-14,"We pause today, to reflect on the past and the future, and we shall resume our work tomorrow."
20248,2013-14,Our work will be seen in our actions.
20249,2013-14,"I turn to my favourite poet, Saint Tiruvalluvar, who said: “Kalangathu Kanda Vinaikkan Thulangkathu Thookkang Kadinthu Seyal” What clearly eye discerns as right, with steadfast will And mind unslumbering, that should man fulfil 188."
20250,2013-14,Any economist will tell us what India can become.
20251,2013-14,We are the tenth largest economy in the world.
20252,2013-14,"We can become the eighth, or perhaps the seventh, largest by 2017."
20253,2013-14,"By 2025, we could become a $ 5 trillion economy, and among the top five in the world."
20254,2013-14,What we will become depends on us and on the choices that we make.
20255,2013-14,"Swami Vivekananda, whose 150th birth anniversary we celebrate this year, told the people: “All the strength and succour you want is within yourself."
20256,2013-14,"Therefore, make your own future.”"
20257,2013-14,"As a resolute step towards that future, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House."
20258,2014-15,I rise to present the Budget for the year 201415.
20259,2014-15,I. STATE OF THE ECONOMY 2.
20260,2014-15,The people of India have decisively voted for a change.
20261,2014-15,The verdict represents the exasperation of the people with the statusquo.
20262,2014-15,India unhesitatingly desires to grow.
20263,2014-15,Those living below the poverty line are anxious to free themselves from the curse of poverty.
20264,2014-15,Those who have got an opportunity to emerge from the difficult challenges have become aspirational.
20265,2014-15,They now want to be a part of the neo middle class.
20266,2014-15,Their next generation has the hunger to use the opportunity that society provides for them.
20267,2014-15,Slow decision making has resulted in a loss of opportunity.
20268,2014-15,Two years of sub five per cent growth in the Indian economy has resulted in a challenging situation.
20269,2014-15,We look forward to lower levels of inflation as compared to the days of double digit rates of food inflation in the last two years.
20270,2014-15,"The country is in no mood to suffer unemployment, inadequate basic amenities, lack of infrastructure and apathetic governance."
20271,2014-15,The slowdown in India broadly reflects the trend in many economies.
20272,2014-15,"In contrast to the aftermath of the crisis of 200809 when restoration of growth in advanced economies was the primary concern, the continuing slowdown being presently witnessed in many emerging economies has posed a threat to a sustained global recovery."
20273,2014-15,"Fortunately, there are green shoots of recovery being seen in the global economy."
20274,2014-15,"As per IMF, the world economy is projected to grow at 3.6 per cent in 2014 visàvis 3.0 per cent in 2013, with the Euro area expected to register a positive growth after the contraction witnessed in 2012 and 2013."
20275,2014-15,"However, the performance of the US economy with attendant implication for the unconventional monetary policy stance and global financial conditions is pivotal to the fate of global recovery in the coming years."
20276,2014-15,These are the head winds 2 against which the Indian economy would have to maneuver its way to attain high growth trajectory.
20277,2014-15,"As Finance Minister I am duty bound to usher in a policy regime that will result in the desired macroeconomic outcome of higher growth, lower inflation, sustained level of external sector balance and a prudent policy stance."
20278,2014-15,The Budget is the most comprehensive action plan in this regard.
20279,2014-15,"In the first Budget of this NDA government that I am presenting before the august House, my aim is to lay down a broad policy indicator of the direction in which we wish to take this country."
20280,2014-15,"The steps that I will announce in this Budget are only the beginning of a journey towards a sustained growth of 78 per cent or above within the next 34 years along with macroeconomic stabilization that includes lower levels of inflation, lesser fiscal deficit and a manageable current account deficit."
20281,2014-15,"Therefore, it would not be wise to expect everything that can be done or must be done to be in the first Budget presented within forty five days of the formation of this Government."
20282,2014-15,"While higher growth is a sine qua non, we cannot be oblivious of the fact that there is a large population of this country which is below the poverty line."
20283,2014-15,It is the poor who suffer the most.
20284,2014-15,We have to ensure that our antipoverty programs are well targeted.
20285,2014-15,The growing aspirations of the people will be reflected in the development strategy followed by the Government led by the Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and its mandate of “Sab ka Saath Sab ka Vikas”.
20286,2014-15,Allow me to assure this House that we have taken up the challenge in the right earnest.
20287,2014-15,We shall leave no stone unturned in creating a vibrant and strong India.
20288,2014-15,The prevailing economic situation presents a great challenge.
20289,2014-15,It calls for a conscious choice to be made by all of us.
20290,2014-15,Should we allow this drift to carry on and watch helplessly?
20291,2014-15,Should we allow our future to suffer because of our indecisiveness?
20292,2014-15,Should we be victims of mere populism or wasteful expenditure?
20293,2014-15,"To me, the response and the remedy are both clear."
20294,2014-15,"The task before me today is very challenging because we need to revive growth, particularly in manufacturing and infrastructure to raise adequate resources for our developmental needs."
20295,2014-15,"On the other hand, the task is simple if we accept the principle that we cannot spend beyond our means."
20296,2014-15,We need to introduce fiscal prudence that will lead to fiscal consolidation and discipline.
20297,2014-15,Fiscal prudence to me is of paramount importance because of considerations of intergenerational equity.
20298,2014-15,We cannot leave behind a legacy of debt for our future generations.
20299,2014-15,We cannot go on spending today which would be financed by taxation at a future date.
20300,2014-15,There is an urgent need to generate more resources to fuel the economy.
20301,2014-15,"For this, the tax to GDP ratio must be improved and nontax revenues increased."
20302,2014-15,We must remember that the decline in fiscal deficit from 5.7 per cent of GDP in 201112 to 4.8 per cent in 201213 3 and 4.5 per cent in 201314 was mainly achieved by reduction in expenditure rather than by way of realization of higher revenue.
20303,2014-15,"Although, the external sector witnessed a turnaround with the year ending with a Current Account Deficit of 1.7 per cent of the GDP against 4.7 per cent in 201213, this was mainly achieved through restriction on nonessential imports and slowdown in overall aggregate demand."
20304,2014-15,"Going forward, we must continue to be watchful of the CAD."
20305,2014-15,My predecessor has set up a very difficult task of reducing fiscal deficit to 4.1 per cent of the GDP in the current year.
20306,2014-15,"Considering that we had two years of low GDP growth, an almost static industrial growth, a moderate increase in indirect taxes, a large subsidy burden and not so encouraging tax buoyancy, the target of 4.1 per cent fiscal deficit is indeed daunting."
20307,2014-15,"Difficult, as it may appear, I have decided to accept this target as a challenge."
20308,2014-15,One fails only when one stops trying.
20309,2014-15,My Road map for fiscal consolidation is a fiscal deficit of 3.6 per cent for 201516 and 3 per cent for 201617.
20310,2014-15,I am conscious of the fact that Iraq crisis is leaving an impact on oil prices and the situation in the middleeast continues to be volatile.
20311,2014-15,Monsoon this year appears more unpredictable.
20312,2014-15,"While inflation has remained at elevated levels relative to what is perceived as acceptable, there has been a gradual moderation in WPI recently, from a high of 7.35% in 201213 and 5.98% in 201314."
20313,2014-15,But we are still not out of the woods.
20314,2014-15,We also must address fully the problem of black money which is curse of our economy.
20315,2014-15,Faced with these adversities we have no option but to undertake some bold steps in order to enhance economic activity and spur growth in the economy.
20316,2014-15,These steps are only the beginning of our effort to revive the growth spirit of the Indian Economy.
20317,2014-15,My Government is committed to the principle of “Minimum Government Maximum Governance”.
20318,2014-15,"To achieve this goal, time has come to review the allocative and operational efficiencies of Government expenditure to achieve maximum output."
20319,2014-15,"The Government will constitute an Expenditure Management Commission, which will look into various aspects of expenditure reforms to be undertaken by the Government."
20320,2014-15,The Commission will give its interim report within this financial year.
20321,2014-15,"I also propose to overhaul the subsidy regime, including food and petroleum subsidies, and make it more targeted while providing full protection to the marginalized, poor and SC/STs."
20322,2014-15,A new urea policy would also be formulated.
20323,2014-15,The debate whether to introduce a Goods and Services Tax GST must now come to an end.
20324,2014-15,We have discussed the issue for the past many years.
20325,2014-15,Some 4 States have been apprehensive about surrendering their taxation jurisdiction; others want to be adequately compensated.
20326,2014-15,I have discussed the matter with the States both individually and collectively.
20327,2014-15,I do hope we are able to find a solution in the course of this year and approve the legislative scheme which enables the introduction of GST.
20328,2014-15,"This will streamline the tax administration, avoid harassment of the business and result in higher revenue collection both for the Centre and the States."
20329,2014-15,I assure all States that government will be more than fair in dealing with them.
20330,2014-15,The sovereign right of the Government to undertake retrospective legislation is unquestionable.
20331,2014-15,"However, this power has to be exercised with extreme caution and judiciousness keeping in mind the impact of each such measure on the economy and the overall investment climate."
20332,2014-15,This Government will not ordinarily bring about any change retrospectively which creates a fresh liability.
20333,2014-15,"Hon’ble Members are aware that consequent upon certain retrospective amendments to the Income Tax Act 1961 undertaken through the Finance Act 2012, a few cases have come up in various courts and other legal fora."
20334,2014-15,These cases are at different stages of pendency and will naturally reach their logical conclusion.
20335,2014-15,At this juncture I would like to convey to this August House and also the investors community at large that we are committed to provide a stable and predictable taxation regime that would be investor friendly and spur growth.
20336,2014-15,"Keeping this in mind, we have decided that henceforth, all fresh cases arising out of the retrospective amendments of 2012 in respect of indirect transfers and coming to the notice of the Assessing Officers will be scrutinized by a High Level Committee to be constituted by the CBDT before any action is initiated in such cases."
20337,2014-15,I hope the investor community both within India and abroad would repose confidence on our stated position and participate in the Indian growth story with renewed vigour.
20338,2014-15,Advance Ruling and Other Tax Related Measures 11.
20339,2014-15,Tax demand of more than ` 4 lakh crore is under dispute and litigation before various Courts and Appellate authorities.
20340,2014-15,This is one of the serious concerns of all taxpayers in this country.
20341,2014-15,"In order to reduce litigation in direct taxes, I propose to make certain legislative and administrative changes."
20342,2014-15,"Currently, an advance ruling can be obtained about the tax liability of a nonresident from the Authority for Advance Rulings."
20343,2014-15,This facility is not available to resident taxpayers except Public Sector Undertakings.
20344,2014-15,I propose to enable resident taxpayers to obtain an advance ruling in respect of their income tax liability above a defined threshold.
20345,2014-15,I also propose to strengthen the Authority for Advance Rulings by constituting additional benches.
20346,2014-15,I further propose to enlarge 5 the scope of the Incometax Settlement Commission so that taxpayers may approach the Commission for settlement of disputes.
20347,2014-15,This would continue to be once in a lifetime opportunity for any taxpayer.
20348,2014-15,"As an administrative measure, I propose to set up a High Level Committee to interact with trade and industry on a regular basis and ascertain areas where clarity in tax laws is required."
20349,2014-15,"Based on the recommendations of the Committee, the Central Board of Direct Taxes and the Central Board of Excise and Customs shall issue appropriate clarifications, wherever considered necessary, on the tax issues within a period of two months."
20350,2014-15,Transfer Pricing is a major area of litigation for both resident and non resident taxpayers.
20351,2014-15,"I have proposed certain changes in the Transfer Pricing regulations, which I would spell out in PartB of my speech."
20352,2014-15,I hope these measures would go a long way in improving the confidence of taxpayers in the tax system and would provide certainty and clarity in tax laws.
20353,2014-15,The policy of the NDA Government is to promote Foreign Direct Investment FDI selectively in sectors where it helps the larger interest of the Indian Economy.
20354,2014-15,FDI in several sectors is an additionality of resource which helps in promoting domestic manufacture and job creation.
20355,2014-15,India today needs a boost for job creation.
20356,2014-15,Our manufacturing sector in particular needs a push for job creation.
20357,2014-15,India today is the largest buyer of Defence equipment in the world.
20358,2014-15,Our domestic manufacturing capacities are still at a nascent stage.
20359,2014-15,We are buying substantial part of our Defence requirements directly from foreign players.
20360,2014-15,Companies controlled by foreign governments and foreign private sector are supplying our Defence requirements to us at a considerable outflow of foreign exchange.
20361,2014-15,Currently we permit 26 per cent FDI in Defence manufacturing.
20362,2014-15,The composite cap of foreign exchange is being raised to 49 per cent with full Indian management and control through the FIPB route.
20363,2014-15,The Insurance sector is investment starved.
20364,2014-15,Several segments of the Insurance sector need an expansion.
20365,2014-15,"The composite cap in the Insurance sector is proposed to be increased up to 49 per cent from the current level of 26 per cent, with full Indian management and control, through the FIPB route."
20366,2014-15,"To encourage development of Smart Cities, which will also provide habitation for the neomiddle class, requirement of the built up area and capital conditions for FDI is being reduced from 50,000 square metres to 20,000 square metres and from USD 10 million to USD 5 million respectively with a three year post completion lock in."

20877,2014-15,I also propose to give relief to individual taxpayers and to certain sectors of the economy.
20878,2014-15,Direct Taxes Let me begin with direct taxes.
20879,2014-15,"Madam Speaker, I do not propose to make any change in the tax rate."
20880,2014-15,"However, with a view to provide relief to small and marginal taxpayers and senior citizens, I propose to increase personal income tax exemption limit by `50,000 that is, from ` 2 lakh to ` 2.5 lakh in the case of individual taxpayers who are below the age of 60 years."
20881,2014-15,"Similarly, I also propose to raise the exemption limit from ` 2.5 lakh to ` 3 lakh in the case of senior citizens."

20884,2014-15,In the year 201213 the gross domestic savings were 30.1% of the GDP as compared to 33.7% in the year 200910.
20885,2014-15,Increase in savings and their productive use leads to higher economic growth.
20886,2014-15,The households are the main contributors to savings.
20887,2014-15,"Therefore, to encourage domestic investment in long Madam Speaker, I shall now present my tax proposals."
20888,2014-15,Taxes are important for every economy to fund Government expenditure on security and welfare of its people.
20889,2014-15,"In the interim Budget 201415, my predecessor had set revenue collection targets for direct taxes as well as indirect taxes, which appear to be ambitious."
20890,2014-15,I propose to retain these targets and it shall be my endeavour to achieve the same.
20891,2014-15,"The impact of the tax changes now proposed have of course been factored into the Budget Estimates, 201415."
20892,2014-15,Housing continues to be an area of concern for middle and lower middle class due to high cost of financing.
20893,2014-15,"Therefore, to reduce this burden, I propose to increase the deduction limit on account of interest on loan in respect of self occupied house property from ` 1.5 lakh to ` 2 lakh."
20894,2014-15,Infrastructure and construction sectors have a significant role in the economy.
20895,2014-15,Growth in these sectors is necessary to revive the economy and generate jobs for millions of our young boys and girls.
20896,2014-15,"As stated earlier and with a view to attract large scale investment in these sectors, I have provided a conducive tax regime for Infrastructure Investment Trusts and Real Estate Investment Trusts to be set up in accordance with regulations of the Securities and Exchange Board of India."
20897,2014-15,The manufacturing sector is of paramount importance for the growth of our economy.
20898,2014-15,This sector has multiplier effect on creation of jobs.
20899,2014-15,"Last year, an incentive in the form of investment allowance to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 100 crore in plant and machinery during the period from 01.04.2013 to 31.03.2015 was announced."
20900,2014-15,"Considering the need to incentivize smaller entrepreneurs, I propose to provide investment allowance at the rate of 15 percent to a manufacturing company that invests more than ` 25 crore in any year in new plant and machinery."
20901,2014-15,This benefit will be available for three years i.e. for investments upto 31.03.2017.
20902,2014-15,The Scheme announced last year will continue to operate in parallel till 31.03.2015. 199.
20903,2014-15,"I also propose to extend the investment linked deduction to two new sectors, namely, slurry pipelines for the transportation of iron ore, and semi conductor wafer fabrication manufacturing units."
20904,2014-15,This will boost investment in these two critical sectors.
20905,2014-15,Supply of power continues to be a major area of concern for the country.
20906,2014-15,"Therefore, instead of annual extensions, I propose to extend the 10 year tax holiday to the undertakings which begin generation, distribution and transmission of power by 31.03.2017."
20907,2014-15,This stability in our policy will help the investors to plan their investments better.
20908,2014-15,Foreign Portfolio Investors FPIs have invested more than ` 8 lakh crore about 130 billion US $ in India.
20909,2014-15,One of their concerns is uncertainty in taxation on account of characterization of their income.
20910,2014-15,"Moreover, the fund managers of these foreign investors remain outside India under the apprehension that their presence in India may have adverse tax consequences."
20911,2014-15,"With a view to put an end 35 to this uncertainty and to encourage these fund managers to shift to India, I propose to provide that income arising to foreign portfolio investors from transaction in securities will be treated as capital gains."
20912,2014-15,The concessional rate of tax at 15 percent on dividends received by Indian companies from their foreign subsidiaries has resulted in enhanced repatriation of funds from abroad.
20913,2014-15,I propose to continue with this concessional rate of 15 percent on foreign dividends without any sunset date.
20914,2014-15,This will ensure stability of taxation policy.
20915,2014-15,"In order to augment low cost long term foreign borrowings for Indian companies, I propose to extend the eligible date of borrowing in foreign currency from 30.06.2016 to 30.06.2017 for a concessional tax rate of 5 percent on interest payments."
20916,2014-15,I also propose to extend this tax incentive to all types of bonds instead of only infrastructure bonds.
20917,2014-15,I hope this measure will enable the companies to step up their investments in India.
20918,2014-15,"In order to reduce litigation on transfer pricing issues, I propose to make certain changes in Transfer Pricing regulations."
20919,2014-15,An Advance Pricing Agreement APA scheme was introduced in the year 2012.
20920,2014-15,It has received good response.
20921,2014-15,I propose to strengthen the administrative set up of APA to expedite disposal of applications.
20922,2014-15,"Further, I propose to introduce a “Roll Back” provision in the APA scheme so that an APA entered into for future transactions may also be applied to international transactions undertaken in previous four years in specified circumstances."
20923,2014-15,"In order to align Transfer Pricing regulations in India with the best available practices, I propose to introduce range concept for determination of arm’s length price."
20924,2014-15,"However, the arithmetic mean concept will continue to apply where number of comparable is inadequate."
20925,2014-15,The relevant data is under analysis and appropriate rules will be prescribed.
20926,2014-15,"As per existing provisions of Transfer Pricing Regulations, only one year data is allowed to be used for comparable analysis with some exception."
20927,2014-15,I propose to amend the regulations to allow use of multiple year data.
20928,2014-15,Necessary legislative amendments to give effect to the above proposals including those relating to the Authority for Advance Rulings and Incometax Settlement Commission will be moved in the current session of the Parliament.
20929,2014-15,"In the case of Mutual Funds, other than equity oriented funds, the capital gains arising on transfer of units held for more than a year is taxed at a concessional rate of 10% whereas direct investments in banks and other debt instruments attract a higher rate of tax."
20930,2014-15,This allows tax arbitrage opportunity.
20931,2014-15,This arbitrage has hardly benefitted retail investors as their percentage is very small among such Mutual Fund investors.
20932,2014-15,"With a view to remove this tax arbitrage, I propose to increase the rate of tax on long term capital gains from 10 percent to 20 percent on transfer of units of such funds."
20933,2014-15,I also propose to increase the period of holding in respect of such units from 12 months to 36 months for this purpose.
20934,2014-15,"In the year 2003, the tax liability on income by way of dividends was shifted from the shareholder to the company."
20935,2014-15,"The shareholder was required to pay tax on the gross dividends, but now the company pays tax on the dividend amount net of taxes."
20936,2014-15,"Similarly, in the case of Mutual Fund, income distribution tax is paid on the income distributed net of taxes."
20937,2014-15,I propose to remove this anomaly both in the case of the company and the Mutual Fund. 207.
20938,2014-15,"Currently, where an assessee fails to deduct and pay tax on specified payments to residents, 100 percent of such payments are not allowed as deduction while computing his income."
20939,2014-15,"This has caused undue hardship to taxpayers, particularly where the rate of tax is only 1 to 10%."
20940,2014-15,"Hence, I propose to provide that instead of 100 percent, only 30% of such payments will be disallowed."
20941,2014-15,"The Direct Taxes Code Bill, 2010 has lapsed with the dissolution of the 15th Lok Sabha."
20942,2014-15,"Having considered the report of the Standing Committee on Finance and the views expressed by the stakeholders, my predecessor had placed a revised Code in the public domain in March, 2014."
20943,2014-15,The Government shall consider the comments received from the stakeholders on the revised Code.
20944,2014-15,The Government will also review the DTC in its present shape and take a view in the whole matter.
20945,2014-15,Incometax Department is expected to function not only as an enforcement agency but also as a facilitator.
20946,2014-15,A number of Aykar Seva Kendras ASK have been opened in different parts of the country.
20947,2014-15,I propose to extend this facility by opening 60 more such Seva Kendras during the current financial year to promote excellence in service delivery.
20948,2014-15,The focus of any tax administration is to broaden the tax base.
20949,2014-15,Our policy thrust is to adopt non intrusive methods to achieve this objective.
20950,2014-15,"In this direction, I propose to make greater use of information technology techniques."
20951,2014-15,"Net Effect of the direct tax proposals is revenue loss of ` 22,200 crore."
20952,2014-15,Manufacturing sector is under stress due to a variety of reasons.
20953,2014-15,"To boost domestic manufacture as also to address the issue of inverted duties, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty BCD on: Fatty acids, crude palm stearin, RBD and other palm stearin, specified industrial grade crude oils from 7.5 percent to Nil for manufacture of soaps and oleochemicals; Crude glycerin from 12.5 percent to 7.5 percent and crude glycerin used in the manufacture of soaps from 12.5 percent to Nil; Steel grade limestone and steel grade dolomite from 5 percent to 2.5 percent; Battery waste and battery scrap from 10 percent to 5 percent; Coal tar pitch from 10 percent to 5 percent; Specified inputs for manufacture of spandex yarn from 5 percent to Nil."
20954,2014-15,"In order to encourage new investment and capacity addition in the chemicals and petrochemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on reformate from 10 percent to 2.5 percent; on ethane, propane, ethylene, propylene, butadiene and orthoxylene from 5 percent to 2.5 percent; on methyl alcohol and denatured ethyl alcohol from 7.5 percent to 5 percent; and on crude naphthalene from 10 percent to 5 percent."
20955,2014-15,The demand for electronics is growing very fast.
20956,2014-15,"To boost domestic production and reduce our dependence on imports, I intend to take the following steps: Impose basic customs duty at 10 percent on specified telecommunication products that are outside the purview of the Information Technology Agreement; Exempt all inputs/components used in the manufacture of personal computers from 4 percent special additional duty SAD; Impose education cess on imported electronic products to provide parity between domestically produced goods and imported goods; Exempt 4 percent SAD on PVC sheet and ribbon used for the manufacture of smart cards."
20957,2014-15,Cathode ray TVs are used by weaker sections who cannot afford to buy more expensive flat panel TVs.
20958,2014-15,I propose to exempt colour picture tubes from basic customs duty to make cathode ray TVs cheaper.
20959,2014-15,The duty concession will help revive manufacturing of TVs in the SME sector and create employment opportunities.
20960,2014-15,"At the same time, to encourage production of LCD and LED TVs below 19 inches in India, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LCD and LED TV panels of below 19 inches from 10 percent to Nil."
20961,2014-15,"Further, to encourage manufacture of LCD and LED TV panels, I propose to exempt from basic customs duty specified inputs used in their manufacture."
20962,2014-15,The domestic stainless steel industry is presently suffering from severe underutilization of capacity.
20963,2014-15,"To give an impetus to the stainless steel industry, I propose to increase the basic customs duty on imported flatrolled products of stainless steel from 5 percent to 7.5 percent."
20964,2014-15,We need to maximize our utilization of solar power.
20965,2014-15,The existing duty structure incentivizes imports rather than domestic manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells and modules.
20966,2014-15,"Therefore, I propose to exempt from basic customs duty: specified inputs for use in the manufacture of EVA sheets and back sheets; flat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons."
20967,2014-15,A concessional basic customs duty of 5 percent is also being extended to machinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for solar energy production.
20968,2014-15,"To promote wind energy, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty from 10 percent to 5 percent on forged steel rings used in the manufacture of bearings of wind operated electricity generators."
20969,2014-15,"Also, I propose to exempt the SAD of 4 percent on parts and raw materials required for the manufacture of wind operated generators."
20970,2014-15,"Further, I propose to prescribe a concessional basic customs duty of 5 percent on machinery and equipment required for setting up of compressed biogas plants BioCNG."
20971,2014-15,I have only highlighted some of the proposals in the Budget 201415.
20972,2014-15,"I am sure these measures would incentivize value addition, generate income and create more jobs in India."
20973,2014-15,I have also undertaken several tax rationalization measures.
20974,2014-15,"At present, coal attracts customs duties at different rates."
20975,2014-15,I propose to rationalize the duty structure on all nonagglomerated coal at 2.5 percent basic customs duty and 2 percent CVD.
20976,2014-15,"Henceforth, anthracite coal, bituminous coal, coking coal, steam 39 coal and other coal will attract the same duty."
20977,2014-15,This will eliminate all assessment disputes and transaction costs associated with testing of various parameters of coal.
20978,2014-15,Metallurgical coke is manufactured out of coking coal.
20979,2014-15,The basic customs duty on metallurgical coke is being increased from Nil to 2.5 percent in line with the duty on coking coal.
20980,2014-15,Ships imported for breaking up attract basic customs duty at 5 percent.
20981,2014-15,"As against this, melting scrap of iron or steel attracts basic customs duty at 2.5 percent."
20982,2014-15,I propose to rationalize the duty on ship breaking scrap and melting scrap of iron or steel by reducing the basic customs duty on ships imported for breaking up from 5 percent to 2.5 percent.
20983,2014-15,"Semiprocessed, half cut or broken diamonds are presently exempt from basic customs duty."
20984,2014-15,"As against this, cut and polished diamonds and coloured gemstones attract basic customs duty of 2 percent."

20988,2014-15,"Considering the need to conserve our natural resources, I propose to increase the export duty on bauxite from 10 percent to 20 percent."
20989,2014-15,The free baggage allowance under the baggage rules was last revised in 2012.
20990,2014-15,"As a measure of passenger facilitation, I propose to increase the free baggage allowance from ` 35,000 to ` 45,000."
20991,2014-15,I shall now deal with excise duties.
20992,2014-15,"To provide a fillip to the capital goods, consumer durables and automobile sectors, and given our commitment to revive economic growth, I have already extended the excise duty concessions beyond 30th June 2014 for a period of 6 months up to 31st December 2014."
20993,2014-15,We expect the industry to show positive results in the coming months.
20994,2014-15,"In continuation, I have a few more proposals to boost domestic production."
20995,2014-15,Minimization of harvest and post harvest losses of agricultural produce is an important measure for tackling food inflation and ensuring food security.
20996,2014-15,The 40 losses in fruits and vegetables are mainly due to lack of adequate processing capacity.
20997,2014-15,"To incentivize expansion of processing capacity, I propose to reduce the excise duty on specified food processing and packaging machinery from 10 percent to 6 percent."
20998,2014-15,"As a measure of relief to the footwear industry, most of which are in SME sector, I propose to reduce the excise duty from 12 percent to 6 percent on footwear of retail price exceeding ` 500 per pair but not exceeding ` 1,000 per pair."
20999,2014-15,Footwear of retail price up to ` 500 per pair will continue to remain exempted.
21000,2014-15,I propose to withdraw the concessional excise duty 2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit on smart cards and levy a uniform excise duty at 12 percent.
21001,2014-15,"Consequently, imports will attract higher CVD."
21002,2014-15,This will help domestic industry.
21003,2014-15,"To develop renewable sources of energy, I propose to exempt from excise duty: EVA sheets and solar back sheets and specified inputs used in their manufacture; solar tempered glass used in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic cells and modules; flat copper wire for the manufacture of PV ribbons for use in solar cells and modules; machinery and equipment required for setting up of a project for solar energy production; forged steel rings used in the manufacture of bearings of wind operated generators; machinery and equipment required for setting up of compressed biogas plants BioCNG."
21004,2014-15,"To set at rest an ongoing dispute, I propose to exempt PSF and PFY manufactured from plastic waste and scrap including PET bottles from excise duty with effect from 29th June, 2010 to 7th May, 2012."
21005,2014-15,I also propose to levy prospectively a nominal duty of 2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit on such PSF and PFY.
21006,2014-15,"To encourage sports, I propose to prescribe a concessional excise duty of 2 percent without Cenvat benefit and 6 percent with Cenvat benefit on sports gloves."
21007,2014-15,"While undertaking all these measures, I also need to mobilize resources."
21008,2014-15,"Accordingly, I propose to increase the specific excise duty on cigarettes in the range of 11 percent to 72 percent."
21009,2014-15,"Similar increases are proposed on cigars, cheroots and cigarillos."
21010,2014-15,"Likewise, the excise duty is being increased from 12 percent to 16 percent on pan masala, from 50 percent to 55 percent on unmanufactured tobacco and from 60 percent to 70 percent on gutkha and chewing tobacco."
21011,2014-15,I also propose to levy an additional duty of excise at 5 percent on aerated waters containing added sugar.
21012,2014-15,These are healthy measures and I hope everyone would welcome them from the point of view of human and fiscal health.
21013,2014-15,"Clean Energy Cess is presently levied on coal, peat and lignite for the purposes of financing and promoting clean energy initiatives and funding research in the area of clean energy."
21014,2014-15,I propose to expand the scope of purposes of levying the said cess to include financing and promoting clean environment initiatives and funding research in the area of clean environment.
21015,2014-15,"To finance these additional initiatives, I propose to increase the Clean Energy Cess from ` 50 per tonne to `100 per tonne."
21016,2014-15,I shall now deal with service tax.
21017,2014-15,"In recent times, among indirect taxes, service tax has shown the highest rate of growth."
21018,2014-15,"Since my overall objective is to prepare the indirect tax regime for a smooth transition to Goods and Services Tax, changes have been kept minimal at this stage."
21019,2014-15,The twin objectives in this sector of indirect taxes are to widen the tax base and enhance compliance.
21020,2014-15,My proposals in relation to Service Tax are in line with these objectives.
21021,2014-15,"To broaden the tax base in Service Tax, it is necessary to prune the negative list and exemptions to the extent possible."
21022,2014-15,"Accordingly, the negative list has been reviewed and service tax leviable currently, on sale of space or time for advertisements in broadcast media, is being extended to cover such sales on other segments like online and mobile advertising."
21023,2014-15,Sale of space for advertisements in print media however would remain excluded from service tax.
21024,2014-15,"Similarly, tax is being proposed on the service provided by radiotaxis to place them on par with rentacab service."
21025,2014-15,These new levies will come into effect from a date to be notified after the passing of the Finance Bill.
21026,2014-15,"In furtherance of the effort to broaden the tax base, certain exemptions are being withdrawn, including those extended to services by airconditioned contract carriages and technical testing of newly developed drugs on human participants."
21027,2014-15,"To spur growth in certain sectors, I have tried to correct the bottlenecks which have been brought to my knowledge."
21028,2014-15,"Indian shipping industry had been 42 representing that they are losing business in a tough global scenario, due to a provision in the Place of Provision of Services Rules, which is now being addressed through an amendment."
21029,2014-15,"Similarly, to encourage growth in the transport of goods through coastal vessels, the tax incidence is being reduced."
21030,2014-15,"In response to the request of the tourism sector, services provided by Indian tour operators to foreign tourists in relation to a tour wholly conducted outside India is being taken out of the tax net."
21031,2014-15,A long standing demand of this sector has been to allow Cenvat credit for services of rentacab and tour operators.
21032,2014-15,I now propose to allow credit in the same line of business.
21033,2014-15,"I had to accept a few requests for exemptions from the social sector, since exemptioninduced distortion would be comparatively less in such sectors."
21034,2014-15,"At the request of the Ministry of Agriculture, service tax on loading, unloading, storage, warehousing and transportation of cotton, whether ginned or baled, is being exempted to bring it on par with certain other agricultural produce."
21035,2014-15,Services provided by the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation for the period prior to 1st July 2012 is being exempted.
21036,2014-15,"For the benefit of the common man, the exemption presently available for specified micro insurance schemes is being expanded to cover all life micro insurance schemes where the sum assured does not exceed ` 50,000 per life insured."
21037,2014-15,"Since taxes should not come in the way of safe disposal of medical and clinical wastes, services provided by common biomedical waste treatment facilities are being exempted."
21038,2014-15,Certain changes are also proposed for bringing about greater clarity and for reducing litigation regarding the scope of exemptions.
21039,2014-15,These include functions ordinarily entrusted to a municipality and services in relation to education.
21040,2014-15,There are a few more decisions which entail small gains or losses of revenue.
21041,2014-15,"Certain amendments are also being proposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts and in the Finance Act, 1994 relating to service tax."
21042,2014-15,These changes are reflected in the budget documents.
21043,2014-15,"My tax proposals on the indirect taxes side are estimated to yield ` 7,525 crore."
21044,2014-15,I have some more proposals which are in the nature of facilitating trade and resolving disputes.
21045,2014-15,I shall highlight only a few.
21046,2014-15,Faster clearance of import and export cargo reduces transaction costs and improves business competitiveness.
21047,2014-15,"To help achieve these objectives, measures are being initiated to extend the existing 24x7 customs clearance facility 43 to 13 more airports in respect of all export goods and to 14 more sea ports in respect of specified import and export goods."
21048,2014-15,It is also proposed to implement an ‘Indian Customs Single Window Project’ to facilitate trade.
21049,2014-15,"Under this, importers and exporters would lodge their clearance documents at a single point only."
21050,2014-15,"Required permissions, if any, from other regulatory agencies would be obtained online without the trader having to approach these agencies."
21051,2014-15,"This would reduce interface with Governmental agencies, dwell time and the cost of doing business."
21052,2014-15,The scheme of Advance Ruling in indirect taxes is being expanded to cover resident private limited companies.
21053,2014-15,This will allow these companies to seek advance ruling in respect of new activities being proposed to be undertaken by them.
21054,2014-15,The scope of Settlement Commission is being enlarged to facilitate quick dispute resolution.
21055,2014-15,"To expedite the process of disposal of appeals, amendments have been proposed in the Customs and Central Excise Acts with a view to freeing appellate authorities from hearing stay applications and to take up regular appeals for final disposal."
21056,2014-15,"Madam Speaker, with these words I commend the Budget to the House."
21057,2015-16,I rise to present the Budget of the Union for the year 201516.
21058,2015-16,I present this Budget in an economic environment which is far more positive than in the recent past.
21059,2015-16,"When other economies are facing serious challenges, India is about to takeoff on a faster growth trajectory once again."
21060,2015-16,"The International Monetary Fund IMF has downgraded its earlier forecast of global economic growth by 0.3%, and the World Trade Organization has revised its forecast of world trade growth from 5.3% to 4%."
21061,2015-16,"Forecasts for India, however, have either been upgraded, or remained the same, without downgrades."
21062,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, we have also embraced the States as equal partners in the process of economic growth."
21063,2015-16,"States have been economically empowered more than ever before and it is my belief that every rupee of public expenditure, whether undertaken by the Centre or the States, will contribute to the betterment of people’s lives through job creation, poverty elimination and economic growth."
21064,2015-16,"In the last nine months, the NDA Government headed by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, has undertaken several significant steps to energise the economy."
21065,2015-16,The credibility of the Indian economy has been reestablished.
21066,2015-16,The world is predicting that it is India’s chance to fly.
21067,2015-16,"Kuch to phool khilaye humne, aur kuch phool khilane hai Mushkil yeh hai bag me ab tak, kaante kai purane hai 4."
21068,2015-16,"Though the Union Budget is essentially a Statement of Account of public finances, it has historically become a significant opportunity to indicate the direction and the pace of India’s economic policy."
21069,2015-16,"My proposals, therefore, lay out the roadmap for accelerating growth, enhancing investment and passing on the benefit of the growth process to the common man, woman, youth and child: those, whose quality of life needs to be improved."
21070,2015-16,This is the path which we will     2 doggedly and relentlessly pursue.
21071,2015-16,"As the Prime Minister has often said, we are a roundtheclock, roundtheyear Government."
21072,2015-16,"In November, 2012, CPI inflation, stood at 11.2%, the current account deficit by the first quarter of 201314 had reached 4.6% of GDP, and normal foreign inflows until March 2014 were $15 billion."
21073,2015-16,"We inherited a sentiment of, if I may say so, doom and gloom, and the investor community had almost written us off."
21074,2015-16,We have come a long way since then.
21075,2015-16,"The latest CPI inflation rate is 5.1%, and the wholesale price inflation is negative; the current account deficit for this year is expected to be below 1.3% of GDP; based on the new series, real GDP growth is expected to accelerate to 7.4%, making India the fastest growing large economy in the world; foreign inflows since April 2014 have been about $55 billion, so that our foreign exchange reserves have increased to a record $340 billion; the rupee has become stronger by 6.4% against a broad basket of currencies; and ours was the secondbest performing stock market amongst the major economies."
21076,2015-16,"In short, Madam Speaker, we have turned around the economy dramatically, restoring macroeconomic stability and creating the conditions for sustainable poverty elimination, job creation and durable doubledigit economic growth."
21077,2015-16,Domestic and international investors are seeing us with renewed interest and hope.
21078,2015-16,"While being mindful of the challenges, Madam Speaker, this gives us reason to feel optimistic."
21079,2015-16,"With all the humility at my command, I submit that this opportunity has arisen because we have created it."
21080,2015-16,"The people of India had voted resoundingly for quick change, faster growth and highest levels of transparency."
21081,2015-16,"They wanted the scam, scandal and corruption Raj to end."
21082,2015-16,They wanted a Government in which they can trust.
21083,2015-16,We have lived up to that trust.
21084,2015-16,Our actions have not been confined to the core or macroeconomic areas alone.
21085,2015-16,"Illustratively, action has been taken with regard to allocation of natural resources; financial inclusion; health and hygiene of the common man; girls and their education; employment for the youth; improved and nonadversarial tax administration; effective delivery of benefits; investment and job creation; welfare of labour; agricultural productivity and increasing farm incomes; power; digital connectivity; skilling our youth; efficient and better work culture in Government; ease of doing business; mainstreaming North Eastern States; and, reviving our pride in the nation and culture."
21086,2015-16,I am giving the details in an Annexure to this speech.
21087,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, of the work that we have done, I would like to talk of three achievements as they demonstrate the quality and conviction of our government."
21088,2015-16,One is the success of the Jan Dhan Yojana.
21089,2015-16,Financial inclusion has           3 been talked about for decades now.
21090,2015-16,"Who would have thought that in a short period of 100 days, over 12.5 crore families could have been brought into the financial mainstream?"
21091,2015-16,The other is coal auctions.
21092,2015-16,"Earlier, the States only got benefits of royalty."
21093,2015-16,"Now, by the transparent auction process that we are carrying out, the coal bearing States will be getting several lakh of crore of rupees which they can use for creation of long awaited community assets and for welfare of their people."
21094,2015-16,The third is ‘Swachh Bharat’ which we have been able to transform into a movement to regenerate India.
21095,2015-16,"I can speak of, for example, the 50 lakh toilets already constructed in 201415, and I can also assure the Members of this august House that we will indeed attain the target of building six crore toilets."
21096,2015-16,"But, Madam, Swachh Bharat is not only a programme of hygiene and cleanliness but, at a deeper level, a programme for preventive health care, and building awareness."
21097,2015-16,We are now embarked on two more game changing reforms.
21098,2015-16,"GST and what the Economic Survey has called the JAM Trinity – Jan Dhan, Aadhar and Mobile – to implement direct transfer of benefits."
21099,2015-16,"GST will put in place a state oftheart indirect tax system by 1st April, 2016."
21100,2015-16,"The JAM Trinity will allow us to transfer benefits in a leakageproof, welltargetted and cashless manner."
21101,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, one of the major achievements of my government has been to conquer inflation."
21102,2015-16,"This decline, in my view, represents a structural shift."
21103,2015-16,"Going forward, we expect CPI inflation to remain at close to 5% by the end of the year."
21104,2015-16,This will allow for further easing of monetary policy.
21105,2015-16,"To ensure that our victory over inflation is institutionalized and hence continues, we have concluded a Monetary Policy Framework Agreement with the RBI, as I had promised in my Budget Speech for 201415."
21106,2015-16,This Framework clearly states the objective of keeping inflation below 6%.
21107,2015-16,"We will move to amend the RBI Act this year, to provide for a Monetary Policy Committee."
21108,2015-16,"The Central Statistics Office has recently released a new series for GDP, which involves a number of changes relative to the old series."
21109,2015-16,"Based on the new series, estimated GDP growth for 201415 is 7.4%."
21110,2015-16,Growth in 201516 is expected to be between 8 to 8.5%.
21111,2015-16,Aiming for a doubledigit rate seems feasible very soon.
21112,2015-16,I now come to the task ahead of us.
21113,2015-16,"In respect of social and economic indicators, for seven decades now, we have worked in terms of percentages, and numbers of beneficiaries covered."
21114,2015-16,It is quite obvious that incremental change is not going to take us anywhere.
21115,2015-16,We have to think in terms of a quantum jump.
21116,2015-16,"The year 2022 will be the Amrut Mahotsav, the 75th year, of India’s independence."
21117,2015-16,"The vision of what the Prime Minister has called ‘Team India’, led by the States and guided by the Central Government, should include:         4"
21118,2015-16,The call given for ‘Housing for all’ by 2022 would require Team India to complete 2 crore houses in urban areas and 4 crore houses in rural areas.
21119,2015-16,"Each house in the country should have basic facilities of 24hour power supply, clean drinking water, a toilet, and be connected to a road."
21120,2015-16,"At least one member from each family should have access to the means for livelihood and, employment or economic opportunity, to improve his or her lot."
21121,2015-16,All our schemes should focus on and centre around the poor.
21122,2015-16,Each of us has to commit ourselves to this task of eliminating absolute poverty.
21123,2015-16,"This will require completing 1,00,000 km of roads currently under construction plus sanctioning and building another 1,00,000 km of road."
21124,2015-16,Providing medical services in each village and city is absolutely essential.
21125,2015-16,"To ensure that there is a senior secondary school within 5 km reach of each child, we need to upgrade over 80,000 secondary schools and add or upgrade 75,000 junior/middle, to the senior secondary level."
21126,2015-16,We also have to ensure that education improves in terms of quality and learning outcomes.
21127,2015-16,"We should commit to increasing the irrigated area, improving the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, promoting agrobased industry for value addition and increasing farm incomes, and reasonable prices for farm produce."
21128,2015-16,"In terms of communication, the rural and urban divide should no longer be acceptable to us."
21129,2015-16,We have to ensure connectivity to all the villages without it.     
21130,2015-16,"To ensure that our young get proper jobs, we have to aim to make India the manufacturing hub of the world."
21131,2015-16,The Skill India and the Make in India programmes are aimed at doing this.
21132,2015-16,We also have to encourage and grow the spirit of entrepreneurship in India and support new startups.
21133,2015-16,"Thus can our youth turn from being jobseekers, to jobcreators."
21134,2015-16,The Eastern and North Eastern regions of our country are lagging behind in development on many fronts.
21135,2015-16,We need to ensure that they are on par with the rest of the country.
21136,2015-16,"By the time of the 75th year of Indian independence, Amrut Mahotsav of our independence is reached, we have to achieve all of the above, so that India becomes a prosperous country; and a responsible global power."
21137,2015-16,This will be our true and meaningful tribute to our freedom fighters.
21138,2015-16,"As I stated earlier, Madam Speaker, I am also mindful of the five major challenges I have to reckon with."
21139,2015-16,"Firstly, Agricultural incomes are under stress."
21140,2015-16,Our second challenge is increasing investment in infrastructure.
21141,2015-16,"With private investment in infrastructure via the public private partnership PPP model still weak, public investment needs to step in, to catalyse investment."
21142,2015-16,Our third major challenge is that manufacturing has declined from 18% to 17% of GDP as per new GDP data; and manufacturing exports have remained stagnant at about 10% of GDP.
21143,2015-16,"The Make in India programme is aimed at meeting this challenge, thus creating jobs."
21144,2015-16,"Fourth, we need to be mindful of the need for fiscal discipline in spite of rising demands for public investment."
21145,2015-16,"In keeping with the true spirit of co operative federalism, we have devolved a 42% share of the divisible pool of taxes to States."
21146,2015-16,"As members of this august House are aware, this is an unprecedented increase which would empower states with more resources."
21147,2015-16,The devolution to the States would be of the order of `5.24 lakh crore in 201516 as against the devolution of `3.38 lakh crore as per revised estimates of 201415.
21148,2015-16,Another `3.04 lakh crore would be transferred by way of grants and plan transfers.
21149,2015-16,"Thus, total transfer to the States will be about 62% of the total tax receipts of the country."
21150,2015-16,"In spite of the consequential reduced fiscal space for the Centre, the Government has decided to continue supporting important national priorities such as agriculture, education, health, MGNREGA, and rural infrastructure including roads."
21151,2015-16,"Programmes targeted for the poor and the underprivileged, will be continued by us.        "
21152,2015-16,"With fiscal space not just reduced but squeezed, I have to meet the fifth challenge of maintaining fiscal discipline."
21153,2015-16,"Economic growth this year, at 11.5%, was lower in nominal terms by about 2%, due to lower inflation."
21154,2015-16,"Consequently, tax buoyancy was also significantly lower."
21155,2015-16,"Despite this, Madam, I have kept my word, and we will meet the challenging fiscal deficit target of 4.1% of GDP, that we had inherited."
21156,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, I need to overcome these challenges to reduce and eliminate poverty."
21157,2015-16,I want to underscore that my government still remains firm on achieving the medium term target of 3% of GDP.
21158,2015-16,But that journey has to take account of the need to increase public investment.
21159,2015-16,"The total additional public investment over and above the RE is planned to be `1.25 lakh crore out of which `70,000 crore would be capital expenditure from budgetary outlays."
21160,2015-16,We also have to take into account the drastically reduced fiscal space; uncertainties that implementation of GST will create; and the likely burden from the report of the 7th Pay Commission.
21161,2015-16,"Rushing into, or insisting on, a preset timetable for fiscal consolidation procyclically would, in my opinion, not be progrowth."
21162,2015-16,"With the economy improving, the pressure for accelerated fiscal consolidation too has decreased."
21163,2015-16,"In these circumstances, I will complete the journey to a fiscal deficit of 3% in 3 years, rather than the two years envisaged previously."
21164,2015-16,"Thus, for the next three years, my targets are: 3.9%, for 201516; 3.5% for 201617; and, 3.0% for 201718."
21165,2015-16,The additional fiscal space will go towards funding infrastructure investment.
21166,2015-16,"I am moving amendments accordingly, in the Finance Bill, to the FRBM Act."
21167,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, I want to round up the discussion on the fiscal road map on an optimistic note."
21168,2015-16,"While there is a compositional shift, the aggregate envelope for job creation, poverty elimination and building infrastructure is not disturbed; in fact it goes up this year, and every subsequent year, in the same proportion as the tax revenues of the Union, and the State Governments increase."
21169,2015-16,"From this national perspective of public finances, not only is the path to fiscal consolidation on track, aggregate annual capital expenditure of the Governments, as a whole, can be expected to rise significantly, by more than 0.5% of GDP."
21170,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, it may be noted that the budget reflects considerable scaling up of disinvestment figures."
21171,2015-16,"This will include both disinvestment in loss making units, and some strategic disinvestment."
21172,2015-16,"Madam, Speaker, this Government is committed in its resolve, as Indians, to regain our preeminence as a just and compassionate country."
21173,2015-16,"Wellintentioned        7 schemes introduced in the past, have often been illtargeted, riddled with leakages and delivered with inefficiency."
21174,2015-16,The same is true of subsidies.
21175,2015-16,Subsidies are needed for the poor and those less well off.
21176,2015-16,What we need is a well targeted system of subsidy delivery.
21177,2015-16,"We need to cut subsidy leakages, not subsidies themselves."
21178,2015-16,We are committed to the process of rationalizing subsidies based on this approach.
21179,2015-16,We have embarked on that path.
21180,2015-16,"The direct transfer of benefits, started mostly in scholarship schemes, will be further expanded with a view to increasing the number of beneficiaries from the present 1 crore to 10.3 crore."
21181,2015-16,"Similarly, `6,335 crore have so far been transferred directly, as LPG subsidy to 11.5 crore LPG consumers."
21182,2015-16,"I am sure, persons who are betteroff, such as those in the top tax bracket, and those genuinely concerned for the welfare of the poor, such as members of this House, will give up their LPG subsidy voluntarily."
21183,2015-16,Our commitment to farmers runs deep.
21184,2015-16,We have already taken major steps to address the two major factors critical to agricultural production: soil and water.
21185,2015-16,An ambitious Soil Health Card Scheme has been launched to improve soil fertility on a sustainable basis.
21186,2015-16,"In order to improve soil health, I also propose to support Agiculture Ministry’s organic farming scheme – “Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana”."
21187,2015-16,The Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana is aimed at irrigating the field of every farmer and improving water use efficiency to provide `Per Drop More Crop’.
21188,2015-16,"I am allocating `5,300 crore to support microirrigation, watershed development and the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana."
21189,2015-16,I urge the States to chip in substantially in this vital sector.
21190,2015-16,"To support the agriculture sector with the help of effective and hassle free agriculture credit, with a special focus on small and marginal farmers, I propose to allocate `25,000 crore in 201516 to the corpus of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund RIDF set up in NABARD; `15,000 crore for Long Term Rural Credit Fund; `45,000 crore for Short Term Cooperative Rural Credit Refinance Fund; and `15,000 crore for Short Term RRB Refinance Fund."
21191,2015-16,Farm credit underpins the efforts of our hardworking farmers.
21192,2015-16,"I have, therefore, set up an ambitious target of `8.5 lakh crore of credit during the year 201516 which, I am sure, the banks will surpass."
21193,2015-16,Our government is committed to supporting employment through MGNREGA.
21194,2015-16,We will ensure that no one who is poor is left without employment.
21195,2015-16,We will focus on improving the quality and effectiveness of activities under MGNREGA.
21196,2015-16,"I have made an initial allocation of `34,699 crore for the programme.      "
21197,2015-16,"While the farmer is no longer in the clutches of the local trader, his produce still does not command the best national price."
21198,2015-16,"To increase the incomes of farmers, it is imperative that we create a National agricultural market, which will have the incidental benefit of moderating price rises."
21199,2015-16,"I intend this year to work with the States, in NITI, for the creation of a Unified National Agriculture Market."
21200,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, our government firmly believes that development has to generate inclusive growth."
21201,2015-16,"While large corporate and business entities have a role to play, this has to be complemented by informal sector enterprises which generate maximum employment."
21202,2015-16,"There are some 5.77 crore small business units, mostly individual proprietorship, which run small manufacturing, trading or service businesses."
21203,2015-16,"These bottom ofthepyramid, hardworking entrepreneurs find it difficult, if not impossible, to access formal systems of credit."
21204,2015-16,"I, therefore, propose to create a Micro Units Development Refinance Agency MUDRA Bank, with a corpus of `20,000 crore, and credit guarantee corpus of `3,000 crore."
21205,2015-16,MUDRA Bank will refinance MicroFinance Institutions through a Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana.
21206,2015-16,"In lending, priority will be given to SC/ST enterprises."
21207,2015-16,"These measures will greatly increase the confidence of young, educated or skilled workers who would now be able to aspire to become first generation entrepreneurs; existing small businesses, too, will be able to expand their activities."
21208,2015-16,"Just as we are banking the unbanked, we are also funding the unfunded."
21209,2015-16,A significant part of the working capital requirement of a MSME arises due to long receivables realization cycles.
21210,2015-16,"We are in the process of establishing an electronic Trade Receivables Discounting System TReDS financing of trade receivables of MSMEs, from corporate and other buyers, through multiple financiers."
21211,2015-16,This should improve the liquidity in the MSME sector significantly.
21212,2015-16,"Bankruptcy law reform, that brings about legal certainty and speed, has beenidentifiedasakeypriorityforimprovingtheeaseofdoingbusiness."
21213,2015-16,SICA Sick Industrial Companies Act and BIFR Bureau for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction have failed in achieving these objectives.
21214,2015-16,"We will bring a comprehensive Bankruptcy Code in fiscal 201516, that will meet global standards and provide necessary judicial capacity."
21215,2015-16,The Government is committed to increasing access of the people to the formal financial system.
21216,2015-16,"In this context, Government proposes to utilize the vast Postal network with nearly 1,54,000 points of presence spread across the villages of the country."
21217,2015-16,I hope that the Postal Department will make its proposed Payments Bank venture successful so that it contributes further to the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana.      
21218,2015-16,"To bring parity in regulation of NonBanking Financial Companies NBFCs with other financial institutions in matters relating to recovery, it is proposed that NBFCs registered with RBI and having asset size of `500 crore and above will be considered for notifications as ‘Financial Institution’ in terms of the SARFAESI Act, 2002."
21219,2015-16,From Jan Dhan to Jan Suraksha 39.
21220,2015-16,"A large proportion of India’s population is without insurance of any kind  health, accidental or life."
21221,2015-16,"Worryingly, as our young population ages, it is also going to be pensionless."
21222,2015-16,"Encouraged by the success of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana, I propose to work towards creating a universal social security system for all Indians, specially the poor and the underprivileged."
21223,2015-16,The soontobelaunched Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojna will cover accidental death risk of `2 lakh for a premium of just `12 per year.
21224,2015-16,"Similarly, we will also launch the Atal Pension Yojana, which will provide a defined pension, depending on the contribution, and its period."
21225,2015-16,"To encourage people to join this scheme, the Government will contribute 50% of the beneficiaries’ premium limited to `1,000 each year, for five years, in the new accounts opened before 31st December, 2015."
21226,2015-16,The third Social Security Scheme that I wish to announce is the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana which covers both natural and accidental death risk of `2 lakhs.
21227,2015-16,"The premium will be `330 per year, or less than one rupee per day, for the age group 1850."
21228,2015-16,"There are unclaimed deposits of about `3,000 crore in the PPF, and approximately `6,000 crore in the EPF corpus."
21229,2015-16,"I have proposed the creation of a Senior Citizen Welfare Fund, in the Finance Bill, for appropriation of these amounts to a corpus which will be used to subsidize the premiums of vulnerable groups such as old age pensioners, BPL cardholders, small and marginal farmers and others."
21230,2015-16,A detailed scheme would be issued in March.
21231,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, special regard needs to be paid to the population of senior citizens in the country which is now approximately 10.5 crore, out of which over one crore are above the age of 80 years."
21232,2015-16,A sizeable percentage of them also suffer from age related disabilities.
21233,2015-16,Ours is a society that venerates its elders.
21234,2015-16,"I, therefore, propose that a new scheme for providing Physical Aids and Assisted Living Devices for senior citizens, living below the poverty line."
21235,2015-16,"In sum, these social security schemes reflect our commitment to utilize the Jan Dhan platform, to ensure that no Indian citizen will have to worry about illness, accidents, or penury in old age."
21236,2015-16,"Being sensitive to the needs of the poor, underprivileged and the disadvantaged, my Government also remains committed      10 to the ongoing welfare schemes for the SCs, STs and Women."
21237,2015-16,"Despite serious constraints on Union finances, allocations made this year are as follows: SC ` 30,851 crore ST ` 19,980 crore Women ` 79,258 crore 45."
21238,2015-16,An integrated education and livelihood scheme called ‘Nai Manzil’ will be launched this year to enable Minority Youth who do not have a formal school leaving certificate to obtain one and find better employment.
21239,2015-16,"Further, to show case civilization and culture of the Parsis, the Government will support, in 201516, an exhibition, ‘The Everlasting Flame’."
21240,2015-16,The allocation for the Ministry of Minority Affairs is being protected.
21241,2015-16,"The BE for the year 201516 is `3,738 crore."
21242,2015-16,"Madam, it is no secret that the major slippage in the last decade has been on the infrastructure front."
21243,2015-16,Our infrastructure does not match our growth ambitions.
21244,2015-16,There is a pressing need to increase public investment.
21245,2015-16,"I have, therefore, increased outlays on both the roads and the gross budgetary support to therailways,by`14,031crore,and`10,050crorerespectively."
21246,2015-16,"In fact, all told, investment in infrastructure will go up by `70,000 crore in the year 201516, over the year 201415 from the Centre’s Funds and resources of CPSEs."
21247,2015-16,"Secondly, I intend to establish a National Investment and Infrastructure Fund NIIF, and find monies to ensure an annual flow of ` 20,000 crore to it."
21248,2015-16,"This will enable the Trust to raise debt, and in turn, invest as equity, in infrastructure finance companies such as the IRFC and NHB."
21249,2015-16,"The infrastructure finance companies can then leverage this extra equity, many fold."
21250,2015-16,"Thirdly, I also intend to permit tax free infrastructure bonds for the projects in the rail, road and irrigation sectors."
21251,2015-16,"Fourth, the PPP mode of infrastructure development has to be revisited, and revitalised."
21252,2015-16,The major issue involved is rebalancing of risk.
21253,2015-16,"In infrastructure projects, the sovereign will have to bear a major part of the risk without, of course, absorbing it entirely."
21254,2015-16,"Fifth, I also intend to establish, in NITI, the Atal Innovation Mission AIM."
21255,2015-16,"AIM will be an Innovation Promotion Platform involving academics, entrepreneurs, and researchers and draw upon national and international experiences to foster a culture of innovation, R&D and scientific research in India."
21256,2015-16,The platform will also promote a network of worldclass innovation hubs and Grand Challenges for India.
21257,2015-16,"Initially, a sum of ` 150 crore will be earmarked for this purpose.       "
21258,2015-16,"India has a well regarded and worldclass IT industry with revenues of about US$ 150 billion, over US$ 100 billion of exports, employing nearly 40 lakh people directly."
21259,2015-16,We are now seeing a growing interest in startups.
21260,2015-16,"Experimenting in cutting edge technologies, creating value out of ideas and initiatives and converting them into scalable enterprises and businesses is at the core of our strategy for engaging our youth and for inclusive and sustainable growth of the country."
21261,2015-16,"Concerns such as a more liberal system of raising global capital, incubation facilities in our Centres of Excellence, funding for seed capital and growth, and ease of Doing Business etc. need to be addressed to create lakh of jobs and hundreds of billion dollars in value."
21262,2015-16,"With this objective, Government is establishing a mechanism to be known as SETU SelfEmployment and Talent Utilisation."
21263,2015-16,"SETU will be a TechnoFinancial, Incubation and Facilitation Programme to support all aspects of startup businesses, and other selfemployment activities, particularly in technologydriven areas."
21264,2015-16,"I am setting aside ` 1,000 crore initially in NITI Aayog for this purpose."
21265,2015-16,"As the success of socalled minor ports has shown, ports can be an attractive investment possibility for the private sector."
21266,2015-16,Ports in the public sector need to both attract such investment as well as leverage the huge land resources lying unused with them.
21267,2015-16,"To enable us to do so, ports in public sector will be encouraged, to corporatize, and become companies under the Companies Act."
21268,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, investors spend a large amount of time and resources on getting the multiple permissions required."
21269,2015-16,We aim towards ease of doing in India.
21270,2015-16,I have myself launched the eBiz Portal which integrates 14 regulatory permissions at one source.
21271,2015-16,Good States are embracing and joining this platform.
21272,2015-16,"However, if we really want to create jobs, we have to make India an investment destination which permits the start of a business in accordance with publically stated guidelines and criteria."
21273,2015-16,I intend to appoint an Expert Committee for this purpose to examine the possibility and prepare a draft legislation where the need for multiple prior permissions can be replaced with a preexisting regulatory mechanism.
21274,2015-16,"The Government also proposes to set up 5 new Ultra Mega Power Projects, each of 4000 MWs in the plugandplay mode."
21275,2015-16,All clearances and linkages will be in place before the project is awarded by a transparent auction system.
21276,2015-16,This should unlock investments to the extent of ` 1 lakh crore.
21277,2015-16,"The Government would also consider similar plugandplay projects in other infrastructure projects such as roads, ports, rail lines, airports etc."
21278,2015-16,I am happy to announce that the second unit of Kudankulam Nuclear Power Station will be commissioned in 201516.     
21279,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, I hope to garner some additional resources during the year from tax buoyancy."
21280,2015-16,"If I am successful, then over and above the budgetary allocation, I will endeavour to enhance allocations to MGNREGA by ` 5,000 crore; Integrated Child Development Scheme ICDS by ` 1,500 crore; Integrated Child Protection Scheme ICPS by ` 500 crore; and the Prdhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana by ` 3,000 crore; and the initial inflow of ` 5,000 crore into the NIIF."
21281,2015-16,"One vital factor in promoting investment in India, including in the infrastructure sector, is the deepening of the Indian Bond market, which we have to bring at the same level as our world class equity market."
21282,2015-16,I intend to begin this process this year by setting up a Public Debt Management Agency PDMA which will bring both India’s external borrowings and domestic debt under one roof.
21283,2015-16,I also propose to merge the Forwards Markets Commission with SEBI to strengthen regulation of commodity forward markets and reduce wild speculation.
21284,2015-16,"Enabling legislation, amending the Government Securities Act and the RBI Act is proposed in the Finance Bill, 2015."
21285,2015-16,"Capital Account Controls is a policy, rather than a regulatory, matter."
21286,2015-16,"I, therefore, propose to amend, through the Finance Bill, Section6 of FEMA to clearly provide that control on capital flows as equity will be exercised by the Government, in consultation with the RBI."
21287,2015-16,A properly functioning capital market also requires proper consumer protection.
21288,2015-16,"I, therefore, also propose to create a Task Force to establish a sector neutral Financial Redressal Agency that will address grievances against all financial service providers."
21289,2015-16,"I am also glad to inform the House that work assigned to the Task Forces on the Financial Data Management Centre, the Financial Sector Appellate Tribunal, the Resolution Corporation, and the Public Debt Management Agency are progressing satisfactorily."
21290,2015-16,"We have also received a large number of suggestions regarding the Indian Financial Code IFC, which are currently being reviewed by the Justice Srikrishna Committee."
21291,2015-16,"I hope, sooner rather than later, to introduce the IFC in Parliament for consideration."
21292,2015-16,"Madam, Speaker, this is just the beginning."
21293,2015-16,"I have a vision of putting in place a direct tax regime which is internationally competitive on rates, is without exemptions, incentivises savings, and does not realize tax from intermediaries."
21294,2015-16,"Such a direct tax regime would match the modernized indirect taxes regime we are putting in place by way of GST, and will bring both greater transparency and greater investments.      "
21295,2015-16,Madam Speaker the situation with regard to the dormant Employees Provident Fund EPF accounts and the claim ratios of ESIs is too well known to be repeated here.
21296,2015-16,"It has been remarked that both EPF and ESI have hostages, rather than clients."
21297,2015-16,"Further, the low paid worker suffers deductions greater than the better paid workers, in percentage terms."
21298,2015-16,"With respect to the Employees Provident Fund EPF, the employee needs to be provided two options."
21299,2015-16,"Firstly, the employee may opt for EPF or the New Pension Scheme NPS."
21300,2015-16,"Secondly, for employees below a certain threshold of monthly income, contribution to EPF should be optional, without affecting or reducing the employer’s contribution."
21301,2015-16,"With respect to ESI, the employee should have the option of choosing either ESI or a Health Insurance product, recognized by the Insurance Regulatory Development Authority IRDA."
21302,2015-16,"We intend to bring amending legislation in this regard, after stakeholder consultation."
21303,2015-16,India is one of the largest consumers of gold in the world and imports as much as 8001000 tonnes of gold each year.
21304,2015-16,"Though stocks of gold in India are estimated to be over 20,000 tonnes, mostly this gold is neither traded, nor monetized."
21305,2015-16,"I propose to: i Introduce a Gold Monetisation Scheme, which will replace both the present Gold Deposit and Gold metal Loan Schemes."
21306,2015-16,The new scheme will allow the depositors of gold to earn interest in their metal accounts and the jewelers to obtain loans in their metal account.
21307,2015-16,Banks/other dealers would also be able to monetize this gold.
21308,2015-16,"The Bonds will carry a fixed rate of interest, and also be redeemable in cash in terms of the face value of the gold, at the time of redemption by the holder of the Bond."
21309,2015-16,Such an Indian Gold Coin would help reduce the demand for coins minted outside India and also help to recycle the gold available in the country.
21310,2015-16,One way to curb the flow of black money is to discourage transactions in cash.
21311,2015-16,"Now that a majority of Indians has or can have, a RUPAY debit card."
21312,2015-16,"I, therefore, proposes to introduce soon several measures that will incentivize credit or debit card transactions, and disincentivise cash transactions.      "
21313,2015-16,Alternate Investment Funds Regulations have been notified by SEBI.
21314,2015-16,Such alternate investment funds provide another vehicle for facilitating domestic investments.
21315,2015-16,"Keeping in view the need to increase investments from all sources, I propose to also allow foreign investments in Alternate Investment Funds."
21316,2015-16,"To further simplify the procedures for Indian Companies to attract foreign investments, I propose to do away with the distinction between different types of foreign investments, especially between foreign portfolio investments and foreign direct investments, and replace them with composite caps The sectors which are already on a 100% automatic route would not be affected."
21317,2015-16,The ‘Act East’ policy of the Government of India endeavours to cultivate extensive economic and strategic relations in SouthEast Asia.

21368,2015-16,"As Members are aware, in making their recommendations, the Finance Commission has not distinguished between special category and other states."
21369,2015-16,"Moreover, both Bihar and West Bengal are going to be amongst the biggest beneficiaries of the recommendations of the Finance Commission."
21370,2015-16,"Yet, the Eastern States have to be given an opportunity to grow even faster."

21376,2015-16,The significant sums that will be spent by the States on these programmes will ensure a quantum leap in expenditures in these areas.
21377,2015-16,I urge states to utilize their enhanced resources effectively in these areas.
21378,2015-16,"Madam, Speaker, I am delighted to report good progress for DMIC corridors: the AhmedabadDhaulera Investment Region in Gujarat, and the Shendra–Bidkin Industrial Park near Aurangabad, in Maharashtra, are now in a position to start work on basic infrastructure."

21390,2015-16,The proposal has languished for years.
21391,2015-16,I am glad to announce that the first phase of GIFT will soon become a reality.
21392,2015-16,Appropriate regulations will be issued in March.
21393,2015-16,"For the quick resolution of commercial disputes, the Government proposes to set up exclusive commercial divisions in various courts in India based on the recommendations of the 253rd Report of the Law Commission."
21394,2015-16,The Government proposes to introduce a Bill in the parliament after consulting stakeholders in this regard.
21395,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, the Government will, during this session, also place before the Parliament the required Bills, to convert Ordinances issued by the Government into Acts of Parliament."
21396,2015-16,BUDGET ESTIMATES I now turn to the Budget Estimates for Budget 201516.
21397,2015-16,"NonPlan expenditure estimates for the Financial Year are estimated at `13,12,200 crore."
21398,2015-16,"Plan expenditure is estimated to be ` 4,65,277 crore, which is very near to the R.E. of 201415."
21399,2015-16,"Total Expenditure has accordingly been estimated at ` 17,77,477 crore."
21400,2015-16,"The requirements for expenditure on Defence, Internal Security and other necessary expenditures are adequately provided."

21405,2015-16,"With the above estimates, fiscal deficit will be 3.9 per cent of GDP and Revenue Deficit will be 2.8 per cent of GDP.       "
21406,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, 19 PART B I now turn to my tax proposals."
21407,2015-16,Taxation is an instrument of social and economic engineering.
21408,2015-16,"Tax collections help the Government to provide education, healthcare, housing and other basic facilities to the people to improve their quality of life and to address the problems of poverty, unemployment and slow development."
21409,2015-16,"To achieve these objectives, it has been our endeavour in the last nine months to foster a stable taxation policy and nonadversarial tax administration."
21410,2015-16,A very important dimension to our tax administration is the fight against the scourge of black money.
21411,2015-16,A number of measures have already been taken in this direction.
21412,2015-16,I propose to do much more.
21413,2015-16,We need to revive growth and investment to ensure that more jobs are created for our youth and benefits of development reach millions of our poor.
21414,2015-16,We need an enabling tax policy for this.
21415,2015-16,I have already introduced the Bill to amend the Constitution of India for Goods and Services Tax GST in the last Session of this august House.
21416,2015-16,GST is expected to play a transformative role in the way our economy functions.
21417,2015-16,It will add buoyancy to our economy by developing a common Indian market and reducing the cascading effect on the cost of goods and services.
21418,2015-16,We are moving in various fronts to implement GST from the next year.
21419,2015-16,We need to match this transformative piece of legislation in indirect taxation with transformative measures in direct taxation.
21420,2015-16,"The basic rate of Corporate Tax in India at 30% is higher than the rates prevalent in the other major Asian economies, making our domestic industry uncompetitive."
21421,2015-16,"Moreover, the effective collection of Corporate Tax is about 23%."
21422,2015-16,"We lose out on both counts, i.e. we are considered as having a high Corporate Tax regime but we do not get that tax due to excessive exemptions."
21423,2015-16,"A regime of exemptions has led to pressure groups, litigation and loss of revenue."
21424,2015-16,It also gives room for avoidable discretion.
21425,2015-16,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the rate of Corporate Tax from 30% to 25% over the next 4 years."
21426,2015-16,"This will lead to higher level of investment, higher growth and more jobs."
21427,2015-16,"This process of reduction has to be necessarily accompanied by rationalisation and removal of various kinds of tax exemptions and incentives for corporate taxpayers, which incidentally account for a large number of tax disputes."
21428,2015-16,I wanted to start the phased reduction of corporate tax rate and phased elimination of exemptions right away; but I thought it would be appropriate to give advance notice that these changes will start from the next financial year.
21429,2015-16,Our stated policy is to avoid sudden surprises and instability in tax policy.
21430,2015-16,"Exemptions to individual taxpayers will, however, continue since they facilitate savings which get transferred to investment and economic growth."
21431,2015-16,"While finalising my tax proposals, I have adopted certain broad themes, which include: Measures to curb black money; Job creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion of domestic manufacturing and ‘Make in India’; Minimum government and maximum governance to improve the ease of doing business; Benefits to middle class taxpayers; Improving the quality of life and public health through Swachch Bharat initiatives; and Stand alone proposals to maximise benefits to the economy."
21432,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, the first and foremost pillar of my tax proposals is to effectively deal with the problem of black money which eats into the vitals of our economy and society."
21433,2015-16,The problems of poverty and inequity cannot be eliminated unless generation of black money and its concealment is dealt with effectively and forcefully.
21434,2015-16,In the last 9 months several measures have been initiated in this direction.
21435,2015-16,"A major breakthrough was achieved in October, 2014 when a delegation from the Revenue Department visited Switzerland and the Swiss authorities agreed to a provide information in respect of cases independently investigated by the Incometax Department; b confirm genuineness of bank accounts and provide nonbanking information; c provide such information in a time bound manner; and d commence talks with India for Automatic Exchange of Information between the two countries at the earliest."
21436,2015-16,"Investigation into cases of undisclosed foreign assets has been accorded the highest priority, resulting in detection of substantial amounts of unreported income."
21437,2015-16,"For strengthening collection of information from various sources domestically, a new structure is being put in place which includes electronic filing of statements by reporting entities."
21438,2015-16,This will ensure seamless integration of data and more effective enforcement.
21439,2015-16,Tracking down and bringing back the wealth which legitimately belongs to the country is our abiding commitment to the country.
21440,2015-16,"Recognising the limitations under the existing legislation, we have taken a considered decision to enact a comprehensive new law on black money to specifically deal with such money stashed away abroad."
21441,2015-16,"To this end, I propose to introduce a Bill in the current Session of the Parliament. 21103."
21442,2015-16,"With your permission, Madam Speaker, I would like to highlight some of the key features of the proposed new law on black money."
21443,2015-16,"Further, this offence will be made noncompoundable; the offenders will not be permitted to approach the Settlement Commission; and penalty for such concealment of income and assets at the rate of 300% of tax shall be levied."
21444,2015-16,"Exemptions or deductions which may otherwise be applicable in such cases, shall not be allowed."
21445,2015-16,"The offence of concealment of income or evasion of tax in relation to a foreign asset will be made a predicate offence under the Prevention of Moneylaundering Act, 2002 PMLA."
21446,2015-16,This provision would enable the enforcement agencies to attach and confiscate unaccounted assets held abroad and launch prosecution against persons indulging in laundering of black money.
21447,2015-16,The definition of ‘proceeds of crime’ under PMLA is being amended to enable attachment and confiscation of equivalent asset in India where the asset located abroad cannot be forfeited.
21448,2015-16,"The Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 FEMA is also being amended to the effect that if any foreign exchange, foreign security or any immovable property situated outside India is held in contravention of the provisions of this Act, then action may be taken 22 for seizure and eventual confiscation of assets of equivalent value situated in India."
21449,2015-16,These contraventions are also being made liable for levy of penalty and prosecution with punishment of imprisonment up to five years.
21450,2015-16,"As regards curbing domestic black money, a new and more comprehensive Benami Transactions Prohibition Bill will be introduced in the current session of the Parliament."
21451,2015-16,"This law will enable confiscation of benami property and provide for prosecution, thus blocking a major avenue for generation and holding of black money in the form of benami property, especially in real estate."
21452,2015-16,A few other measures are also proposed in the Budget for curbing black money within the country.
21453,2015-16,"The Finance Bill includes a proposal to amend the Incometax Act to prohibit acceptance or payment of an advance of `20,000 or more in cash for purchase of immovable property."
21454,2015-16,Quoting of PAN is being made mandatory for any purchase or sale exceeding the value of `1 lakh.
21455,2015-16,The third party reporting entities would be required to furnish information about foreign currency sales and cross border transactions.
21456,2015-16,Provision is also being made to tackle splitting of reportable transactions.
21457,2015-16,"To improve enforcement, CBDT and CBEC will leverage technology and have access to information in each other’s database."
21458,2015-16,"Madam Speaker, the second pillar of my taxation proposals this year is job creation through revival of growth and investment and promotion of domestic manufacturing and ‘Make in India’."
21459,2015-16,"I propose to undertake a series of steps in this direction to attract capital, both domestic and foreign."
21460,2015-16,"Tax ‘pass through’ is proposed to be allowed to both CategoryI and CategoryII Alternative Investment Funds, so that tax is levied on the investors in these Funds and not on the Funds per se."
21461,2015-16,"This will step up the ability of these Funds to mobilise higher resources and make higher investments in small and medium enterprises, infrastructure and social projects and provide the much required private equity to new ventures and startups."
21462,2015-16,A step was taken in the last Budget to encourage Real Estate Investment Trusts REITs and Infrastructure Investments Trusts InvITs by providing partial pass through to them.
21463,2015-16,These collective investment vehicles have an important role to revive construction activity.
21464,2015-16,A large quantum of funds is locked up in various completed projects which need to be released to facilitate new infrastructure projects to take off.
21465,2015-16,"I therefore propose to rationalise the capital gains regime for the sponsors exiting at the time of listing of the units of REITs and InvITs, subject to payment of Securities Transaction Tax STT."
21466,2015-16,The rental income of REITs from their own assets will have pass through facility.
21467,2015-16,The present taxation structure has an inbuilt incentive for fund managers to operate from offshore locations.
21468,2015-16,"To encourage such offshore fund managers to relocate to India, I propose to modify the Permanent Establishment PE norms to the effect that mere presence of a fund manager in India would not constitute PE of the offshore funds resulting in adverse tax consequences."
21469,2015-16,Implementation of the General Anti Avoidance Rule GAAR has been a matter of public debate.
21470,2015-16,The investment sentiment in the country has now turned positive and we need to accelerate this momentum.
21471,2015-16,There are also certain contentious issues relating to GAAR which need to be resolved.
21472,2015-16,It has therefore been decided to defer the applicability of GAAR by two years.
21473,2015-16,"Further, it has also been decided that when implemented, GAAR would apply prospectively to investments made on or after 01.04.2017."
21474,2015-16,Today I see a lot of young entrepreneurs running business ventures or wanting to start new ones.
21475,2015-16,"Therefore, to facilitate technology inflow to small businesses at low costs, I propose to reduce the rate of income tax on royalty and fees for technical services from 25% to 10%."
21476,2015-16,"To generate greater employment opportunities, it is proposed to extend the benefit of deduction for employment of new regular workmen to all business entities."
21477,2015-16,The eligibility threshold of minimum 100 regular workmen is being reduced to fifty.
21478,2015-16,The role of indirect taxes is also very important in the context of promotion of domestic manufacturing and Make in India.
21479,2015-16,"In indirect taxes, therefore, I propose to reduce the rates of basic customs duty on certain inputs, raw materials, intermediates and components in all 22 items so as to minimise the impact of duty inversion and reduce the manufacturing cost in several sectors."
21480,2015-16,Some other changes address the problem of CENVAT credit accumulation due to the levy of SAD.
21481,2015-16,"I propose to fully exempt all goods, except populated printed circuit boards for use in manufacture of ITA bound items from SAD and reduce the SAD on imports of certain other inputs and raw materials subject to actual user condition."
21482,2015-16,These changes are detailed in the Annexure to the Budget Speech.
21483,2015-16,My next proposal is regarding minimum government and maximum governance with focus on ease of doing business and simplification of Tax Procedures without compromising on tax revenues.
21484,2015-16,"The total wealth tax collection in the country was `1,008 crore in 201314."
21485,2015-16,Should a tax which leads to high cost of collection and a low yield be continued or should it be replaced with a low cost and higher yield tax?
21486,2015-16,The rich and wealthy must pay more tax than the less affluent ones.
21487,2015-16,I have therefore decided to abolish the wealth tax and replace it with an additional surcharge of 2% on the superrich with a taxable income of over `1 crore.
21488,2015-16,This will lead to tax simplification and enable the Department to 24 focus more on ensuring tax compliance and widening the tax base.
21489,2015-16,"As against a tax sacrifice of `1,008 crore, through these measures the Department would be collecting about `9,000 crore from the 2% additional surcharge."
21490,2015-16,"Further, to track the wealth held by individuals and entities, the information regarding the assets which are currently required to be furnished in wealthtax return will be captured in the income tax returns."
21491,2015-16,This will ensure that the abolition of wealth tax does not lead to escape of any income from the tax net.
21492,2015-16,The provision relating to indirect transfers in the Incometax Act which is a legacy from the previous government contains several ambiguities.
21493,2015-16,This provision is being suitably cleaned up.
21494,2015-16,"Further, concerns regarding applicability of indirect transfer provisions to dividends paid by foreign companies to their shareholders will be addressed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes through a clarificatory circular."
21495,2015-16,These changes would eliminate the scope for discretionary exercise of power and provide a hassle free structure to the taxpayers.
21496,2015-16,I reiterate what I had said in the last Budget that ordinarily retrospective tax provisions adversely impact the stability and predictability of the taxation regime and resort to such provisions shall be avoided.
21497,2015-16,"Further, to reduce the associated hassles to smaller taxpayers and the compliance costs in domestic transfer pricing, I propose to increase the threshold limit from `5 crore to `20 crore."
21498,2015-16,"In order to rationalise the MAT provisions for FIIs, profits corresponding to their income from capital gains on transactions in securities which are liable to tax at a lower rate, shall not be subject to MAT. 117."
21499,2015-16,The Tax Administration Reform Commission TARC has given a number of recommendations to improve the administration in the Tax Departments.

21557,2015-16,"Thus, the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of `15,068 crore."
21558,2015-16,"To conclude, Madam Speaker, it is no secret that expectations of this Budget have been high."
21559,2015-16,"People who urge us to undertake Big Bang Reforms, also say that the Indian economy is a giant super tanker, or an elephant."
21560,2015-16,"An elephant, Madam Speaker, moves slowly but surely."
21561,2015-16,Even our worst critics would admit that we have moved rapidly.
21562,2015-16,"In this speech, I think I have clearly outlined not only what we are going to do immediately, but also a roadmap for the future."
21563,2015-16,"I think I can genuinely stake, for our Government, a claim of intellectual honesty."
21564,2015-16,"We have been consistent in what we have said, and what we are doing."
21565,2015-16,"We are committed, Madam Speaker, to achieving what we have been voted to power for: Change, growth, jobs and genuine, effective upliftment of the poor and the underprivileged."

21568,2015-16,Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih OM!
21569,2015-16,May All Be Happy May All Be Free From Illness May All See What is Beneficial May No One Suffer 133.
21570,2015-16,"With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House."
21571,2016-17,I rise to present the Budget for the year 201617.
21572,2016-17,Global growth has slowed down from 3.4% in 2014 to 3.1% in 2015.
21573,2016-17,Financial markets have been battered and global trade has contracted.
21574,2016-17,"Amidst all these global headwinds, the Indian economy has held its ground firmly."
21575,2016-17,"Thanks to our inherent strengths and the policies of this Government, a lot of confidence and hope continues to be built around India."
21576,2016-17,The International Monetary Fund has hailed India as a ‘bright spot’ amidst a slowing global economy.
21577,2016-17,The World Economic Forum has said that India’s growth is ‘extraordinarily high’.
21578,2016-17,"We accomplished this despite very unfavourable conditions and despite the fact that we inherited an economy of low growth, high inflation and zero investor confidence in Government’s capability to govern."
21579,2016-17,We converted these difficulties and challenges into opportunities.
21580,2016-17,BÉE¶iÉÉÒ SÉãÉÉxÉä ́ÉÉãÉÉå xÉä VÉ¤É cÉ® BÉäE nÉÒ {ÉiÉ ́ÉÉ® càÉå ãÉc®ãÉc® iÉÚ}ÉEÉxÉ ÉÊàÉãÉä
21581,2016-17,Let us look at our achievements compared to the last three years of the previous Government when growth had decelerated to 6.3%.
21582,2016-17,The growth of GDP has now accelerated to 7.6%.
21583,2016-17,This was possible notwithstanding the contraction of global exports by 4.4% compared to 7.7% growth in world exports during the last three years of the previous Government.
21584,2016-17,CPI inflation was at 9.4% during the last three years of the previous Government.
21585,2016-17,"Under our Government, CPI inflation has come down to 5.4%, providing big relief to the public."
21586,2016-17,"This was accomplished despite two consecutive years of monsoon shortfall of 13%, compared to normal rainfall in the last three years of the previous Government."
21587,2016-17,Our external situation is robust.
21588,2016-17,The Current Account deficit has declined from 18.4 billion US dollars in the first half of last year to 14.4 billion this year.
21589,2016-17,It is projected to be 1.4% of GDP at the end of this year.
21590,2016-17,Our foreign exchange reserves are at the highest ever level of about 350 billion US dollars.
21591,2016-17,"Our initiatives in the last 21 months have not only placed the economy on a faster growth trajectory but have bridged the trust deficit, created by the previous Government."
21592,2016-17,"We had to work in an unsupportive global environment, adverse weather conditions and an obstructive political atmosphere."
21593,2016-17,"We believe in the principle that money with the Government belongs to the people and we have the sacred responsibility to spend it prudently and wisely for the welfare of our people, especially the poor and the downtrodden."
21594,2016-17,We have increased our Plan expenditure at the RE stage in 201516 in contrast to the usual practice of reducing it.
21595,2016-17,We achieved this despite adopting the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommendations which increased devolution to the States by 55%.
21596,2016-17,We must now look ahead.
21597,2016-17,The risks of further global slowdown and turbulence are mounting.
21598,2016-17,This complicates the task of economic management for India.
21599,2016-17,It has three serious implications for us.
21600,2016-17,"First, we must strengthen our firewalls against these risks by ensuring macro economic stability and prudent fiscal management."
21601,2016-17,"Second, since foreign markets are weak, we must rely on domestic demand and Indian markets to ensure that India’s growth does not slow down."
21602,2016-17,"And third, we must continue with the pace of economic reforms and policy initiatives to change the lives of our people for the better."
21603,2016-17,We see these challenges as opportunities.
21604,2016-17,The financial years 201516 and 201617 have been and will be extremely challenging for thGovernment expenditure.
21605,2016-17,The 14 Finance Commission has reduced the Central share of taxes to 58% from the 68%.
21606,2016-17,"In the financial year 201516, we managed to improve upon the budgeted expenditure due to revenue buoyancy, notwithstanding the steep reduction in the Central share of taxes."
21607,2016-17,The next financial year 201617 will cast an additional burden on account of ththe recommendations of the 7 Central Pay Commission and the implementation of Defence OROP.
21608,2016-17,"The Government, therefore, has to prioritise its expenditure."
21609,2016-17,"We wish to enhance expenditure in the farm and rural sector, the social sector, the infrastructure sector and provide for 3 recapitalisation of the banks."
21610,2016-17,This will address those sectors which need immediate attention.
21611,2016-17,"Once the Government discharges these priority obligations, it shall then focus on other areas which are also of utmost priority to the Government."
21612,2016-17,"While increasing the outlay of various social sector programmes, the Government will undertake three major schemes to help the weaker sections of the society."
21613,2016-17,The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana has already been announced to protect the farmer from the adverse consequences of nature.
21614,2016-17,The farmer will pay a nominal amount of insurance premium and get the highest ever compensation in the event of any loss suffered.
21615,2016-17,A health insurance scheme which protects onethird of India’s population against hospitalisation expenditure is also being announced.
21616,2016-17,"The Government is also launching a new initiative to ensure that the BPL families are provided with a cooking gas connection, supported by a Government subsidy."
21617,2016-17,This will significantly improve the health of women and those BPL families who suffer adversely from the illeffects of Chulha cooking.
21618,2016-17,The Annual Budget is also an opportunity for the Government to outline its priorities for the year to come.
21619,2016-17,"The priority of our Government is clearly to provide additional resources for vulnerable sections, rural areas and social and physical infrastructure creation."
21620,2016-17,"The Government shall also endeavour to continue with the ongoing reform programme and ensure the passage of the Constitutional amendments to enable the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax, the passage of Insolvency and Bankruptcy law and other important reform measures which are pending before the Parliament."
21621,2016-17,"Additionally, as I will elaborate later, we will undertake significant reforms, such as the enactment of a law to ensure that all Government benefits are conferred upon persons who deserve it, by giving a statutory backing to the AADHAR platform; bringing significant changes in the legislative framework relating to the transport sector so as to free it from constraints and restrictions; incentivising gas discovery and exploration by providing calibrated marketing freedom; enactment of a comprehensive law to deal with resolution of financial firms; providing legal framework for dispute resolution in PPP projects and public utility contracts; undertaking important banking sector reforms and public listing of general insurance companies; and undertaking significant changes in FDI policy."
21622,2016-17,"Our agenda for the next year is, therefore, to ‘Transform India’ in this direction."
21623,2016-17,"My Budget proposals are, therefore, built on this transformative agenda with nine distinct pillars."
21624,2016-17,"These include: 4 i Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare: with focus on doubling farmers’ income in five years; ii Rural Sector: with emphasis on rural employment and infrastructure; iii Social Sector including Healthcare: to cover all under welfare and health services; iv Education, Skills and Job Creation: to make India a knowledge based and productive society; v Infrastructure and Investment: to enhance efficiency and quality of life; vi Financial Sector Reforms: to bring transparency and stability; vii Governance and Ease of Doing Business: to enable the people to realise their full potential; viii Fiscal Discipline: prudent management of Government finances and delivery of benefits to the needy; and ix Tax Reforms: to reduce compliance burden with faith in the citizenry."
21625,2016-17,"In each of these themes, I shall outline specific policy measures and initiatives which would have a transformative impact on our economy and the lives of our people."
21626,2016-17,I. Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare 14.
21627,2016-17,Let me first take up Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare.
21628,2016-17,We are grateful to our farmers for being the backbone of the country’s food security.
21629,2016-17,We need to think beyond ‘food security’ and give back to our farmers a sense of ‘income security’.
21630,2016-17,"Government will, therefore, reorient its interventions in the farm and nonfarm sectors to double the income of the farmers by 2022."
21631,2016-17,"Our total allocation for Agriculture and Farmers’ welfare is ` 35,984 crore."
21632,2016-17,We need to address issues of optimal utilisation of our water resources; create new infrastructure for irrigation; conserve soil fertility with balanced use of fertilizer; and provide value addition and connectivity from farm to markets.
21633,2016-17,Irrigation is a critical input for increasing agriculture production and productivity.
21634,2016-17,"Out of 141 million hectares of net cultivated area in the country, only 46% is covered with irrigation."
21635,2016-17,The ‘Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana’ has been strengthened and will be implemented in mission mode.
21636,2016-17,"Implementation of 89 irrigation projects under AIBP, which have been languishing, will be fast tracked."
21637,2016-17,This will help to irrigate 80.6 lakh hectares.
21638,2016-17,"These projects require `17,000 crore next year and `86,500 crore in the next five years."
21639,2016-17,"We will ensure that 23 of these projects are completed stbefore 31 March, 2017."
21640,2016-17,"A dedicated Long Term Irrigation Fund will be created in NABARD with an initial corpus of about `20,000 crore."
21641,2016-17,"To achieve all these, a total provision of `12,517 crore has been made through budgetary support and market borrowings in 201617."
21642,2016-17,"Simultaneously a major programme for sustainable management of ground water resources has been prepared with an estimated cost of `6,000 crore and proposed for multilateral funding."
21643,2016-17,At least 5 lakh farm ponds and dug wells in rain fed areas and 10 lakh compost pits for production of organic manure will be taken up by making productive use of the allocations under MGNREGA.
21644,2016-17,The Soil Health Card Scheme is now being implemented with greater vigour.
21645,2016-17,"Through this, farmers get information about nutrient level of the soil and can make judicious use of fertilizers."
21646,2016-17,The target is to cover all 14 crore farm holdings by March 2017.
21647,2016-17,"Besides, 2,000 model retail outlets of Fertilizer companies will be provided with soil and seed testing facilities during the next three years."
21648,2016-17,Fertilizer companies will also comarket city compost which increases the efficacy of chemical fertilizer.
21649,2016-17,A policy for conversion of city waste into compost has also been approved by the Government under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan.
21650,2016-17,"To increase crop yields in rain fed areas, which account for nearly 55% of the country’s arable land, organic farming is being promoted."
21651,2016-17,"Towards this end, the Government has launched two important schemes."
21652,2016-17,"First, the ‘Parmparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana’ which will bring 5 lakh acres under organic farming over a three year period."
21653,2016-17,"Second, the Government has launched a value chain based organic farming scheme called “Organic Value Chain Development in North East Region”."
21654,2016-17,The emphasis is on value addition so that organic produce grown in these parts find domestic and export markets.
21655,2016-17,A total provision of `412 crore has been made for these schemes.
21656,2016-17,Incentives are being given for enhancement of pulses production.

21660,2016-17,The Government is implementing the Unified Agriculture Marketing Scheme which envisages a common emarket platform that will be deployed in selected 585 regulated wholesale markets.
21661,2016-17,Amendments to the APMC Acts of the States are a prerequisite to join this eplatform.
21662,2016-17,I am happy to inform that 12 States have already amended their APMC Acts and are ready to come on board.
21663,2016-17,More States are expected to join this platform in the coming year.
21664,2016-17,The Unified Agricultural Marketing E Platform will be dedicated to the th Nation on the birthday of Dr. Baba Saheb Ambedkar on 14 year .
21665,2016-17,April this 27. 97 lakh MT of storage capacity was added to the Central pool stock during the current year.
21666,2016-17,We are implementing the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana PMGSY as never before.
21667,2016-17,This Scheme had suffered in the past because of underfunding.
21668,2016-17,"The allocations in 201213 and 201314 were only `8,885 crore and `9,805 crore respectively."
21669,2016-17,"We have substantially increased the allocation in the last two years and have now allocated `19,000 crore in 201617."
21670,2016-17,"Together with States’ share, totally about `27,000 crore will be spent on this Yojana in 201617."
21671,2016-17,"Our goal is to advance the completion target of the programme from 2021 to 2019 and connect the remaining 65,000 eligible habitations by constructing 2.23 lakh kms of roads."
21672,2016-17,"Accordingly, the pace of construction which is currently 100 kms per day, as compared to the average of 73.5 kms during 201114, will be substantially stepped up."
21673,2016-17,"To support farmers in the aftermath of natural calamities, Government has revised the norms of assistance under the National Disaster Response Fund in April 2015."
21674,2016-17,Special focus has been given to ensure adequate and timely flow of credit to the farmers.
21675,2016-17,"Against the target of `8.5 lakh crore in 201516, the target for agricultural credit in 201617 will be an alltime high of `9 lakh crore."
21676,2016-17,"To reduce the burden of loan repayment on farmers, a provision of `15,000 crore has been made in the BE 201617 towards interest subvention."
21677,2016-17,"Government has approved the path breaking Crop Insurance Scheme, namely, Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana."
21678,2016-17,"For effective implementation of this Scheme, I have provided a sum of `5,500 crore in the Budget 201617."
21679,2016-17,We have to ensure that the benefit of MSP reaches farmers in all parts of the country.
21680,2016-17,Three specific initiatives will be taken up in 201617 for this.
21681,2016-17,"First, the remaining States will be encouraged to take up decentralized procurement."
21682,2016-17,"Second, an online Procurement System will be undertaken through the Food Corporation of India."
21683,2016-17,This will usher in transparency and convenience to the farmers through prior registration and monitoring of actual procurement.
21684,2016-17,"Third, effective arrangements have been made for pulses procurement."

21940,2016-17,Let me now elaborate on the fiscal situation in the context of the Budget for the year 201617.
21941,2016-17,"While preparing this Budget, I have received conflicting suggestions about the FRBM roadmap."
21942,2016-17,Different schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive 21 consolidation and for boosting growth.
21943,2016-17,I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets.
21944,2016-17,"Consequently, the fiscal deficit in RE 201516 and BE 201617 have been retained at 3.9% and 3.5% of GDP respectively."
21945,2016-17,"While doing so, I have ensured that the development agenda has not been compromised."
21946,2016-17,"The total expenditure in the Budget for 201617 has been projected at `19.78 lakh crore, consisting of `5.50 lakh crore under Plan and `14.28 lakh crore under NonPlan."

21951,2016-17,This is the last year of the 12 Plan.
21952,2016-17,Successive committees have questioned the merit in having Plan and NonPlan classification of Government expenditure.
21953,2016-17,A broad understanding over the years has been that Plan expenditures are good and NonPlan expenditures are bad.
21954,2016-17,This results in skewed allocations in the Budget.
21955,2016-17,We need to correct this and give greater focus to Revenue and Capital classification of Government expenditure.
21956,2016-17,"We have, therefore, decided that the PlanNonPlan classification will be done away with from fiscal 201718."

21962,2016-17,"There is now a school of thought which believes that instead of fixed numbers as fiscal deficit targets, it may be better to have a fiscal deficit range as the target, which would give necessary policy space to the Government to deal with dynamic situations."
21963,2016-17,"There is also a suggestion that fiscal expansion or contraction should be aligned with credit contraction or expansion respectively, in the economy."
21964,2016-17,"While remaining committed to fiscal prudence and consolidation, a time has come to review the working of the FRBM Act, especially in the context of the uncertainty and volatility which have become the new norms of global economy."
21965,2016-17,"I, therefore, propose to constitute a Committee to review the implementation of the FRBM Act and give its recommendations on the way forward."

22075,2016-17,The surcharge levied at 7.5% of undisclosed income will be called Krishi Kalyan surcharge to be used for agriculture and rural economy.
22076,2016-17,We plan to open the window under this Income Disclosure stdue within two months of declaration.
22077,2016-17,"Scheme from 1 June to 30 September, 2016 with an option to pay amount th 161."
22078,2016-17,Our Government is fully committed to remove black money from the economy.
22079,2016-17,"Having given one opportunity for evaded income to be declared once, we would then like to focus all our resources for bringing people with black money to books."
22080,2016-17,Litigation is a scourge for a tax friendly regime and creates an environment of distrust in addition to increasing the compliance cost of the tax payers and administrative cost for the Government.
22081,2016-17,There are about 3 st lakh tax cases pending with the 1 Appellate Authority with disputed amount 30 being 5.5 lakh crores.
22082,2016-17,"In order to reduce this number, I propose a new Dispute Resolution Scheme DRS. 163."
22083,2016-17,A taxpayer who has an appeal pending as of today before the Commissioner Appeals can settle his case by paying the disputed tax and interest up to the date of assessment.
22084,2016-17,No penalty in respect of Incometax cases with disputed tax up to ` 10 lakh will be levied.
22085,2016-17,Cases with disputed tax exceeding ` 10 lakh will be subjected to only 25% of the minimum of the imposable penalty for both direct and indirect taxes.
22086,2016-17,Any pending appeal against a penalty order can also be settled by paying 25% of the minimum of the imposable penalty.
22087,2016-17,Certain categories of persons including those who are charged with criminal offences under specific Acts are proposed to be barred from availing this scheme.
22088,2016-17,"I had in my Budget speech of July, 2014 assured that this Government would not retrospectively create a fresh tax liability."
22089,2016-17,"I had also hoped then that the cases pending in various courts and other legal fora relating to certain retrospective amendments undertaken to the Incometax Act, 1961, through the Finance Act, 2012 will soon reach their logical conclusion."
22090,2016-17,I would like to reiterate that we are committed to provide a stable and predictable taxation regime.
22091,2016-17,We will not resort to such amendments in future.
22092,2016-17,I had also announced constitution of a High Level Committee which would oversee any fresh case where the assessing officer proposes to assess or reassess the income in respect of indirect transfers by applying the retrospective amendment.
22093,2016-17,"In order to allay any fears of tax adventurism, this Committee will now be chaired by the Revenue Secretary and consist of Chairman, CBDT and an expert from outside."
22094,2016-17,This Committee will effectively oversee the implementation of the assurances.
22095,2016-17,"In order to give an opportunity to the past cases which are ongoing under the retrospective amendment, I propose a onetime scheme of Dispute Resolution for them, in which, subject to their agreeing to withdraw any pending case lying in any Court or Tribunal or any proceeding for arbitration, mediation etc."
22096,2016-17,Levy of heavy penalty for concealment of income has over the years resulted in large number of disputes despite a number of decisions of the Apex court on interpretation of statutory provisions and principles guiding imposition of penalty.
22097,2016-17,At present the Incometax Officer has discretion to levy penalty at the rate of 100% to 300% of tax sought to be evaded.
22098,2016-17,I propose to modify the entire scheme of penalty by providing different categories of misdemeanor with graded penalty and thereby substantially reducing the discretionary power of the tax officers.
22099,2016-17,The penalty rates will now be 50% of tax in case of underreporting of income and 200% of tax 31 where there is misreporting of facts.
22100,2016-17,Remission of penalty is also proposed in certain circumstances where taxes are paid and appeal is not filed.
22101,2016-17,Another issue which has led to considerable number of disputes is quantification of disallowance of expenditure relatable to exempt income in terms of Section 14A of the Income Tax Act.
22102,2016-17,I propose to rationalize the formula in Rule 8D governing such quantification.
22103,2016-17,"The said Rule is being amended to provide that disallowance will be limited to 1% of the average monthly value of investments yielding exempt income, but not exceeding the actual expenditure claimed."
22104,2016-17,"As another tax payer friendly measure, I propose to provide a time limit of one year for disposing petitions of the tax payers seeking waiver of interest and penalty."
22105,2016-17,"The Incometax Department is also issuing instruction making it mandatory for the assessing officer to grant stay of demand once the assesse pays 15% of the disputed demand, while the appeal is pending before Commissioner of Incometax Appeals."
22106,2016-17,"In case of deviation, assessing officer has to get orders of his superiors."
22107,2016-17,The tax payer also has an option to go to superior officer in case he does not agree with conditions of stay order passed by the subordinate officer.
22108,2016-17,"In order to remove backlog of cases we are creating 11 new benches of Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal CESTAT."
22109,2016-17,The monetary limit for deciding an appeal by a single member Bench of ITAT is proposed to be enhanced from `15 lakhs to `50 lakhs.
22110,2016-17,"I also propose to amend the CENVAT Credit Rules, 2004, so as to improve credit flow, reduce the compliance burden and associated litigation, particularly those relating to apportionment of credit between exempted and non exempted final products/services."
22111,2016-17,The amendments in these rules will also enable manufacturers with multiple manufacturing units to maintain a common warehouse for inputs and distribute inputs with credits to the individual manufacturing units.
22112,2016-17,Simplification and rationalization of taxation 173.
22113,2016-17,The Government has already accepted many recommendations of Tax Administration Reform Committee and I propose to accept a number of recommendations of Justice Easwar Committee in this Budget.
22114,2016-17,"To reduce multiplicity of taxes, associated cascading and to reduce cost of collection, I propose to abolish 13 cesses, levied by various Ministries in which revenue collection is less than `50 crore in a year."
22115,2016-17,"To improve the cash flow position of small tax payers who get their funds blocked due to current TDS provision, I propose to rationalize TDS provisions for Income Tax as per Annexure. 176."
22116,2016-17,Nonresidents without PAN are currently subjected to a higher rate of TDS.
22117,2016-17,"It is proposed to amend the relevant provision to provide that on furnishing of alternative documents, the higher rate will not apply."
22118,2016-17,"The facility for revision of return, hitherto available to a service tax assessee only, is being extended to Central Excise assessees also."
22119,2016-17,"I propose to provide additional options to banking companies and financial institutions, including nonbanking financial companies, for reversal of input tax credits with respect to nontaxable services provided by them by way of extending deposits, loans and advances."
22120,2016-17,Our Government has taken a number of steps to reduce the cargo release time and the transaction costs of EXIM trade.
22121,2016-17,I propose to amend the Customs Act to provide for deferred payment of customs duties for importers and exporters with proven track record.
22122,2016-17,"In 201415 Budget, I had announced the intent to implement Indian Customs Single Window Project."
22123,2016-17,We have made significant progress in this and it would be implemented at major ports and airports starting from beginning of next financial year.
22124,2016-17,The customs Baggage Rules for international passengers are being simplified so as to increase the free baggage allowance.
22125,2016-17,The filing of baggage declaration will be required only for those passengers who carry dutiable goods.
22126,2016-17,Use of Technology for creating accountability 182.
22127,2016-17,Technology is a boon for mankind.
22128,2016-17,"We plan to use technology in taxation Department in a big way to make life simpler for a law abiding citizen, and also for data mining to track tax evaders."
22129,2016-17,A pilot was run in 201516 for eassessment to obviate the requirement for tax payers to visit the Incometax offices.
22130,2016-17,I propose to expand the scope of eassessments to all assessees in 7 mega cities in the coming years.
22131,2016-17,"The cases selected for scrutiny will be scrutinized in eenvironment whereby unless the assessee himself wants to be heard, or for special reasons to be recorded, the assessing officer wants to hear the party, there will be no face to face contact of IT Department with assessee."
22132,2016-17,"Incometax Department ITD will fully expand the pilot initiative of ‘eSahyog’ with a view to reduce compliance cost, especially for small 33 taxpayers."
22133,2016-17,The objective of the ‘eSahyog’ pilot project is to provide an online mechanism to resolve mismatches in Incometax returns without requiring taxpayers to attend the Incometax office.
22134,2016-17,"I propose that in matters pertaining to Incometax Act, Government will pay interest at the rate of 9% p.a against normal rate of 6% p.a in case there is delay in giving effect to Appellate order beyond ninety days."
22135,2016-17,"The officers who delay it, will be accountable for this loss to Government."
22136,2016-17,"I also propose to change the procedure to provide for a shift from physical control to record based control for customs bonded warehouses, supported by sophisticated IT systems."
22137,2016-17,"Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals would result in revenue loss of ` 1,060 crore and my indirect proposals are expected to yield `20,670 crores."
22138,2016-17,"Thus the net impact of all tax proposals would be revenue gain of `19,610 crores."
22139,2016-17,"CONCLUSION Madam Speaker, 188."
22140,2016-17,This Budget is being presented amidst global and domestic headwinds.
22141,2016-17,We see them as opportunities.
22142,2016-17,"I have outlined the agenda of our Government to ‘Transform India’ for the benefit of the farmers, the poor and the vulnerable."
22143,2016-17,"Madam Speaker, it is said that “Champions are made from something they have deep inside of them  a desire, a dream, a vision”."
22144,2016-17,"We have a desire to provide socioeconomic security to every Indian, especially the farmers, the poor and the vulnerable; we have a dream to see a more prosperous India; and a vision to ‘Transform India’."
22145,2016-17,"With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House."
22146,2017-18,"On this auspicious day of Vasant Panchami, I rise to present the Budget for 201718."
22147,2017-18,Spring is a season of optimism.
22148,2017-18,I extend my warm greetings to everyone on this occasion.
22149,2017-18,The underlying theme of countless expectations was good governance.
22150,2017-18,"The expectations included burning issues like inflation and price rise, corruption in day to day transactions and crony capitalism."
22151,2017-18,"There was also expectation for a major change in the way the country’s natural resources were allocated, processed and deployed."
22152,2017-18,"In the last two and half years, it has been our mission to bring a Transformative Shift in the way our country is governed."
22153,2017-18,We have moved  from a discretionary administration to a policy and system based administration;  from favouritism to transparency and objectivity in decision making;  from blanket and loose entitlements to targeted delivery; and  from informal economy to formal economy.
22154,2017-18,"Inflation, which was in double digits, has been controlled; sluggish growth has been replaced by high growth; and a massive war against black money has been launched."
22155,2017-18,We have worked tirelessly on all these fronts and feel encouraged by the unstinted support of the people to our initiatives.
22156,2017-18,The Government is now seen as a trusted custodian of public money.
22157,2017-18,I take this opportunity to express our gratitude to the people of India for their strong support.
22158,2017-18,"We shall continue to undertake many more measures to ensure that the fruits of growth reach the farmers, the workers, the poor, the scheduled 4 castes and scheduled tribes, women and other vulnerable sections of our society."
22159,2017-18,Our focus will be on energising our youth to reap the benefits of growth and employment.
22160,2017-18,"Nevertheless, the International Monetary Fund IMF estimates that world GDP will grow by 3.1% in 2016 and 3.4% in 2017."
22161,2017-18,The advanced economies are expected to increase their growth from 1.6% to 1.9% and the emerging economies from 4.1% to 4.5%.
22162,2017-18,"As per current indications, macroeconomic policy is expected to be more expansionary in certain large economies."
22163,2017-18,"Growth in a number of emerging economies is expected to recover in 2017, after relatively poor performance in 2016."
22164,2017-18,These are positive signs and point to an optimistic outlook for the next year.
22165,2017-18,"There are, however, three major challenges for emerging economies."
22166,2017-18,"First, the current monetary policy stance of the US Federal Reserve, to increase the policy rates more than once in 2017, may lead to lower capital inflows and higher outflows from the emerging economies."
22167,2017-18,"Second, the uncertainty around commodity prices, especially that of crude oil, has implications for the fiscal situation of emerging economies."
22168,2017-18,"It is however expected that increase, if any, in oil prices would get tempered by quick response from producers of shale gas and oil."
22169,2017-18,This would have a sobering impact on prices of crude and petroleum.
22170,2017-18,"Third, in several parts of the world, there are signs of increasing retreat from globalisation of goods, services and people, as pressures for protectionism are building up."
22171,2017-18,"These developments have the potential to affect exports from a number of emerging markets, including India."
22172,2017-18,"Amidst all these developments, India stands out as a bright spot in the world economic landscape."
22173,2017-18,India’s macroeconomic stability continues to be the foundation of economic success.
22174,2017-18,"CPI inflation declined from 6% in July 2016 to 3.4% in December, 2016 and is expected to remain within RBI’s mandated range of 2% to 6%."
22175,2017-18,"Favourable price developments reflect prudent macroeconomic management, resulting in higher agricultural production, especially in pulses."
22176,2017-18,India’s Current Account Deficit declined from about 1% of GDP last year to 0.3% of GDP in the first half of 201617.
22177,2017-18,"Foreign Direct Investment FDI increased from ` 1,07,000 crores in the first half of last year to ` 1,45,000 crores in the first half of 201617."
22178,2017-18,"This marks an increase by 36%, despite 5% reduction in global FDI inflows."
22179,2017-18,"Foreign exchange reserves have reached 361 billion US Dollars as on 20th January, 5 2017, which represents a comfortable cover for about 12 months of imports.8."
22180,2017-18,"The Government has also continued on the steady path of fiscal consolidation, without compromising on the public investment requirements of the economy."
22181,2017-18,"Externally, the economy successfully weathered a number of shocks, the redemption of FCNR deposits, volatility from the US elections and the Fed rate hike."
22182,2017-18,"According to IMF forecast, India is expected to be one of the fastest growing major economies in 2017."
22183,2017-18,"A number of global reports and assessments, over the last two years, have shown that India has considerably improved its policies, practices and economic profile."
22184,2017-18,These are reflected in Doing Business Report of the World Bank; World Investment Report 2016 of UNCTAD; Global Competitiveness Report of 201516 and 201617 of the World Economic Forum; and several other Reports.
22185,2017-18,"India has become the sixth largest manufacturing country in the world, up from ninth previously."
22186,2017-18,We are seen as an engine of global growth.
22187,2017-18,"In the last one year, our country has witnessed historic and impactful economic reforms and policy making."
22188,2017-18,"In fact, India was one of the very few economies undertaking transformational reforms."
22189,2017-18,"There were two tectonic policy initiatives, namely, passage of the Constitution Amendment Bill for GST and the progress for its implementation ; and demonetisation of high denomination bank notes."
22190,2017-18,"The advantages of GST for our economy in terms of spurring growth, competitiveness, indirect tax simplification and greater transparency have already been extensively discussed in both Houses of Parliament."
22191,2017-18,I thank all Members of both the Houses for having passed the Constitution Amendment unanimously.
22192,2017-18,I also thank the State Governments for resolving all relevant issues in the GST Council.
22193,2017-18,Demonetisation of high denomination bank notes was in continuation of a series of measures taken by our Government during the last two years.
22194,2017-18,It is a bold and decisive measure.
22195,2017-18,"For several decades, tax evasion for many has become a way of life."
22196,2017-18,"This compromises the larger public interest and creates unjust enrichment in favour of the tax evader, to the detriment of the poor and deprived."
22197,2017-18,This has bred a parallel economy which is unacceptable for an inclusive society.
22198,2017-18,"Demonetisation seeks to create a new ‘normal’ wherein the GDP would be bigger, cleaner and real."
22199,2017-18,"This exercise is part of our Government’s resolve to eliminate corruption, black money, counterfeit currency and terror funding."
22200,2017-18,"Like all reforms, this measure is obviously disruptive, as it seeks to change the retrograde status quo."
22201,2017-18,"Drop in economic activity, if any, on account of the currency squeeze during the remonetisation period is expected to have only a transient 6 impact on the economy."
22202,2017-18,"I am reminded here of what the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi, had said: “A right cause never fails”."
22203,2017-18,"Demonetisation has strong potential to generate longterm benefits in terms of reduced corruption, greater digitisation of the economy, increased flow of financial savings and greater formalisation of the economy, all of which would eventually lead to higher GDP growth and tax revenues."
22204,2017-18,"Demonetisation helps to transfer resources from the tax evaders to the Government, which can use these resources for the welfare of the poor and the deprived."
22205,2017-18,There is early evidence of an increased capacity of Banks to lend at reduced interest rates and a huge shift towards digitisation among all sections of society.
22206,2017-18,"We firmly believe that demonetisation and GST which were built on the third transformational achievement of our Government, namely, the JAM vision, will have an epoch making impact on our economy and the lives of our people."
22207,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, we are at an important turning point in the path of our growth and development."
22208,2017-18,A +ÉÉ{É VÉÉä ¤ÉÉiÉ xÉaÉÉÒ cè =oÉä +É{ÉxÉÉ<A +ÉÉ{É b®iÉä cé xÉaÉÉÒ ®Éc {Éä BÉDaÉÉå SÉãÉxÉä oÉä càÉ
22209,2017-18,The pace of remonetisation has picked up and will soon reach comfortable levels.
22210,2017-18,The effects of demonetisation are not expected to spill over into the next year.
22211,2017-18,"Thus IMF, even while revising India’s GDP forecast for 2016 downwards, has projected a GDP growth of 7.2% and 7.7% in 2017 and 2018 respectively."
22212,2017-18,"The World Bank, however, is more optimistic and has projected a GDP growth of 7% in 201617, 7.6% in 201718 and 7.8% in 201819."
22213,2017-18,This pick up in our economy is premised upon our policy and determination to continue with economic reforms; increase in public investment in infrastructure and development projects; and export growth in the context of the expected rebound in world economy.
22214,2017-18,"The surplus liquidity in the banking system, created by demonetisation, will lower borrowing costs and increase the access to credit."
22215,2017-18,"This will boost economic activity, with multiplier effects."
22216,2017-18,"The announcements made by Honourable Prime Minister on 31st December, 2016 address many of the key concerns of our economy at this juncture, such as, housing for the poor; relief to farmers; credit support to 7 MSMEs; encouragement to digital transactions; assistance to pregnant women and senior citizens; and priority to dalits, tribals, backward classes and women under the Mudra Yojana."
22217,2017-18,"My overall approach, while preparing this Budget, has been to spend more in rural areas, infrastructure and poverty alleviation and yet maintain the best standards of fiscal prudence."
22218,2017-18,"I have also kept in mind the need to continue with economic reforms, promote higher investments and accelerate growth."
22219,2017-18,"The last one year was a witness to other major reforms, namely, enactment of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code; amendment to the RBI Act for inflation targeting; enactment of the Aadhar bill for disbursement of financial subsidies and benefits; significant reforms in FDI policy; the job creating package for textile sector; and several other measures."
22220,2017-18,We will continue the process of economic reforms for the benefit of the poor and the underprivileged.
22221,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, the Budget for 201718 contains three major reforms."
22222,2017-18,"First, the presentation of the Budget has been advanced to 1st February to enable the Parliament to avoid a Vote on Account and pass a single Appropriation Bill for 201718, before the close of the current financial year."
22223,2017-18,"This would enable the Ministries and Departments to operationalise all schemes and projects, including the new schemes, right from the commencement of the next financial year."
22224,2017-18,They would be able to fully utilise the available working season before the onset of the monsoon.
22225,2017-18,"Second, the merger of the Railways Budget with the General Budget is a historic step."
22226,2017-18,We have discontinued the colonial practice prevalent since 1924.
22227,2017-18,"This decision brings the Railways to the centre stage of Government’s fiscal policy and would facilitate multi modal transport planning between railways, highways and inland waterways."
22228,2017-18,"The functional autonomy of Railways will, however, continue."
22229,2017-18,"Third, we have done away with the plan and nonplan classification of expenditure."
22230,2017-18,This will give us a holistic view of allocations for sectors and ministries.
22231,2017-18,This would facilitate optimal allocation of resources.
22232,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, we are aware that we need to do more for our people."
22233,2017-18,"Continuing with the task of fulfilling the people’s expectations, our agenda for the next year is : “Transform, Energise and Clean India”, that is, TEC India."
22234,2017-18,"This agenda of TEC India seeks to  Transform the quality of governance and quality of life of our people; 8  Energise various sections of society, especially the youth and the vulnerable, and enable them to unleash their true potential; and  Clean the country from the evils of corruption, black money and nontransparent political funding."
22235,2017-18,I propose to present my Budget proposals under ten distinct themes to foster this broad agenda.
22236,2017-18,"The themes are : i Farmers : for whom we have committed to double the income in 5 years; ii Rural Population : providing employment and basic infrastructure; iii Youth : energising them through education, skills and jobs; iv Poor and the Underprivileged : strengthening the systems of social security, health care and affordable housing; v Infrastructure: for efficiency, productivity and quality of life; vi Financial Sector : growth and stability through stronger institutions; vii Digital Economy : for speed, accountability and transparency; viii Public Service : effective governance and efficient service delivery through people’s participation; ix Prudent Fiscal Management : to ensure optimal deployment of resources and preserve fiscal stability; and x Tax Administration : honouring the honest."
22237,2017-18,FARMERS I. 20. 21.
22238,2017-18,"In last year’s Budget speech, I focused on ‘income security’ of farmers to double their income in 5 years."
22239,2017-18,I had also announced a number of measures.
22240,2017-18,We have to take more steps and enable the farmers to increase their production and productivity; and to deal with postharvest challenges.
22241,2017-18,The Indian farmer has once again shown his commitment and resilience in the current year.
22242,2017-18,The total area sown under kharif and rabi seasons are higher than the previous year.
22243,2017-18,"With a better monsoon, agriculture is expected to grow at 4.1% in the current year."
22244,2017-18,"For a good crop, adequate credit should be available to farmers in time."
22245,2017-18,The target for agricultural credit in 201718 has been fixed at a record level of ` 10 lakh crores.
22246,2017-18,"We will take special efforts to ensure adequate flow of credit to the under serviced areas, the Eastern States and Jammu & Kashmir."
22247,2017-18,The farmers will also benefit from 60 days’ interest waiver announced by Honourable Prime Minister in respect of their loans from the cooperative credit structure.
22248,2017-18,About 40% of the small and marginal farmers avail credit from the cooperative structure.
22249,2017-18,The Primary Agriculture Credit Societies PACS act as the front end for loan disbursements.
22250,2017-18,"We will support NABARD for computerisation and integration of all 63,000 functional PACS with the Core Banking System of District Central Cooperative Banks."
22251,2017-18,"This will be done in 3 years at an estimated cost of ` 1,900 crores, with financial participation from State Governments."
22252,2017-18,This will ensure seamless flow of credit to small and marginal farmers.
22253,2017-18,"At the time of sowing, farmers should feel secure against natural calamities."

22562,2017-18,"In the recent past, there have been instances of big time offenders, including economic offenders, fleeing the country to escape the reach of law."
22563,2017-18,We have to ensure that the law is allowed to take its own course.
22564,2017-18,"Government is therefore considering introduction of legislative changes, or even a new law, to confiscate the assets of such persons located within the country, till they submit to the jurisdiction of the appropriate legal forum."
22565,2017-18,Needless to say that all necessary constitutional safeguards will be followed in such cases.

22575,2017-18,"With the abolition of PlanNon Plan classification of expenditure, the focus is now on Revenue and Capital expenditure."
22576,2017-18,I have stepped up the allocation for Capital expenditure by 25.4% over the previous year.

22586,2017-18,The Committee has done an elaborate exercise and has recommended that a sustainable debt path must be the principal macroeconomic anchor of our fiscal policy.
22587,2017-18,"The Committee has favoured Debt to GDP of 60% for the General Government by 2023, consisting of 40% for Central Government and 20% for State Governments."
22588,2017-18,"Within this framework, the Committee has derived and recommended 3% fiscal deficit for the next three years."
22589,2017-18,"The Committee has also provided for ‘Escape Clauses’, for deviations upto 0.5% of GDP, from the stipulated fiscal deficit target."
22590,2017-18,"Among the triggers for taking recourse to these Escape Clauses, the Committee has included “farreaching structural reforms in the economy with unanticipated fiscal implications” as one of the factors."
22591,2017-18,"Although there is a strong case now to invoke this Escape Clause, I am refraining from doing so."
22592,2017-18,The Report of the Committee will be carefully examined and appropriate decisions taken in due course.
22593,2017-18,"Nevertheless, I take note of the fiscal deficit roadmap of 3% recommended by the Committee for the next three years."
22594,2017-18,I have taken into consideration the need for higher public expenditure in the context of sluggish private sector investment and slow global growth.
22595,2017-18,I have kept in mind the recommendation of the Committee that a sustainable debt should be the underlying basis of prudent fiscal management.
22596,2017-18,"Considering all these aspects, I have pegged the fiscal deficit for 201718 at 3.2% of GDP and remain committed to achieve 3% in the following year."
22597,2017-18,"With this gradual approach, I have ensured adherence to fiscal consolidation, without compromising the requirements of public investment."
22598,2017-18,"I have taken due care to limit the net market borrowing of Government to ` 3.48 lakh crores after buyback, much lower than ` 4.25 lakh crores of the previous year."
22599,2017-18,"More importantly, the Revenue Deficit of 2.3% in BE 201617 stands reduced to 2.1% in the Revised Estimates."
22600,2017-18,"The Revenue Deficit for next year is pegged at 1.9% , against 2% mandated by the FRBM Act."
22601,2017-18,"It will be our endeavour to improve upon these fiscal numbers, especially the fiscal deficit, in the next year, through greater focus on quality of expenditure and higher tax realisation from the huge cash deposits in Banks, triggered by demonetisation."
22602,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, 28 PART B I shall now present my tax proposals: India’s tax to GDP ratio is very low, and the proportion of direct tax to indirect tax is not optimal from the view point of social justice."
22603,2017-18,I place before you certain data to indicate that our direct tax collection is not commensurate with the income and consumption pattern of Indian economy.
22604,2017-18,"As against estimated 4.2 crore persons engaged in organised sector employment, the number of individuals filing return for salary income are only 1.74 crore."
22605,2017-18,"As against 5.6 crore informal sector individual enterprises and firms doing small business in India, the number of returns filed by this category are only 1.81 crore."
22606,2017-18,"Out of the 13.94 lakh companies registered in India upto 31st March, 2014, 5.97 lakh companies have filed their returns for Assessment Year 201617."
22607,2017-18,"Of the 5.97 lakh companies which have filed their returns for Assessment Year 201617 so far, as many as 2.76 lakh companies have shown losses or zero income."
22608,2017-18,"Among the 3.7 crore individuals who filed the tax returns in 201516, 99 lakh show income below the exemption limit of ` 2.5 lakh p.a., 1.95 crore show income between ` 2.5 to ` 5 lakh, 52 lakh show income between ` 5 to ` 10 lakhs and only 24 lakh people show income above ` 10 lakhs."
22609,2017-18,"Of the 76 lakh individual assesses who declare income above ` 5 lakh, 56 lakh are in the salaried class."
22610,2017-18,The number of people showing income more than ` 50 lakh in the entire country is only 1.72 lakh.
22611,2017-18,"We can contrast this with the fact that in the last five years, more than 1.25 crore cars have been sold, and number of Indian citizens who flew abroad, either for business or tourism, is 2 crore in the year 2015."
22612,2017-18,From all these figures we can conclude that we are largely a tax noncompliant society.
22613,2017-18,The predominance of cash in the economy makes it possible for the people to evade their taxes.
22614,2017-18,"When too many people evade taxes, the burden of their share falls on those who are honest and compliant."
22615,2017-18,"After the demonetisation, the preliminary analysis of data received in respect of deposits made by people in old currency presents a revealing picture."
22616,2017-18,"During the period 8th November to 30th December 2016, deposits between ` 2 lakh and ` 80 lakh were made in about 1.09 crore accounts with an average deposit size of ` 5.03 lakh."
22617,2017-18,Deposits of more than 80 lakh were made in 1.48 lakh accounts with average deposit size of ` 3.31 crores.
22618,2017-18,"This data mining will help us immensely in expanding the tax net as well as increasing the revenues, which was one of the objectives of demonetisation."
22619,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, one of the main priorities of our Government is to eliminate the black money component from the economy."
22620,2017-18,"We are committed to make our taxation rates more reasonable, our tax administration more fair and expand the tax base in the country."
22621,2017-18,This approach will change the colour of money.
22622,2017-18,The net tax revenue of 201314 was ` 11.38 lakh crores.
22623,2017-18,This grew by 9.4% in 201415 and 17% in 201516.
22624,2017-18,"As per the RE of 201617, we will end the year with a high growth rate of 17% for the second year in a row."
22625,2017-18,"Because of the serious efforts made by the Government, the rate of growth of advance tax in personal income tax in the first three quarters of the current financial is 34.8%."
22626,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, the thrust of my tax proposals in this Budget is stimulating growth, relief to middle class, affordable housing, curbing black money, promoting digital economy, transparency of political funding and simplification of tax administration."
22627,2017-18,Measures for Promoting Affordable Housing and Real Estate Sector 146.
22628,2017-18,"In my budget proposals last year, I had announced a scheme for profitlinked income tax exemption for promoters of affordable housing scheme which has received a very good response."
22629,2017-18,"However, in order to make this scheme more attractive, I propose certain changes in the scheme."
22630,2017-18,"First of all, instead of built up area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr., the carpet area of 30 and 60 sq.mtr."
22631,2017-18,"In order to be eligible, the scheme was to be completed in 3 years after commencement."
22632,2017-18,I propose to extend this period to 5 years.
22633,2017-18,"At present, the houses which are unoccupied after getting completion certificates are subjected to tax on notional rental income."
22634,2017-18,"For builders for whom constructed buildings are stockintrade, I propose to 30 apply this rule only after one year of the end of the year in which completion certificate is received so that they get some breathing time for liquidating their inventory."
22635,2017-18,We also propose to make a number of changes in the capital gain taxation provisions in respect of land and building.
22636,2017-18,The holding period for considering gain from immovable property to be long term is 3 years now.
22637,2017-18,This is proposed to be reduced to 2 years.
22638,2017-18,"Also, the base year for indexation is proposed to be shifted from 1.4.1981 to 1.4.2001 for all classes of assets including immovable property."
22639,2017-18,This move will significantly reduce the capital gain tax liability while encouraging the mobility of assets.
22640,2017-18,We also plan to extend the basket of financial instruments in which the capital gains can be invested without payment of tax.
22641,2017-18,"For Joint Development Agreement signed for development of property, the liability to pay capital gain tax will arise in the year the project is completed."
22642,2017-18,The new capital for State of Andhra Pradesh is being constructed by innovative landpooling mechanism without use of the Land Acquisition Act.
22643,2017-18,"I propose to exempt from capital gain tax, persons holding land on 2.6.2014, the date on which the State of Andhra Pradesh was reorganised, and whose land is being pooled for creation of capital city under the Government scheme."
22644,2017-18,Measures for Stimulating Growth 151.
22645,2017-18,A concessional withholding rate of 5% is being charged on interest earned by foreign entities in external commercial borrowings or in bonds and Government securities.
22646,2017-18,This concession is available till 30.6.2017.
22647,2017-18,I propose to extend it to 30.6.2020.
22648,2017-18,This benefit is also extended to Rupee Denominated Masala Bonds.
22649,2017-18,The Government gave income tax exemptions to startups with certain conditions last year.
22650,2017-18,"For the purpose of carry forward of losses in respect of such startups, the condition of continuous holding of 51% of voting rights has been relaxed subject to the condition that the holding of the original promoter/promoters continues."
22651,2017-18,Also the profit linked deduction available to the startups for 3 years out of 5 years is being changed to 3 years out of 7 years.
22652,2017-18,Minimum Alternate Tax is at present levied as an advance tax.
22653,2017-18,There is a strong demand for abolition of MAT.
22654,2017-18,"Although the plan for phasing out of exemptions will kick in from 1.4.2017, the full benefit of revenue out of phaseout will be available to Government only after 7 to 10 years when all 31 those who are already availing exemptions at present complete their period of availment."
22655,2017-18,"Therefore, it is not practical to remove or reduce MAT at present."
22656,2017-18,"However, in order to allow companies to use MAT credit in future years, I propose to allow carry forward of MAT upto a period of 15 years instead of 10 years at present."
22657,2017-18,"In my Budget proposals in 2015, I had announced that I would be bringing the corporate income tax rate down to 25% gradually."
22658,2017-18,"In 2016 Budget, I had announced a reduction by 1% in case of those companies whose turnover is less than ` 5 crore."
22659,2017-18,"In the same Budget, I had also announced that new manufacturing companies who do not avail of any exemption would be charged only 25% income tax."
22660,2017-18,Medium and Small Enterprises occupy bulk of economic activities and are also instrumental in providing maximum employment to people.
22661,2017-18,"However, since they do not get many exemptions, they end up paying more taxes as compared to large companies."
22662,2017-18,"As per data of financial year 201516, 2.85 lakh companies making profit of less than ` 1 crore pay effective tax rate of 30.26% while 298 companies making profit above ` 500 crores pay effective tax rate of 25.90%."
22663,2017-18,"In order to make MSME companies more viable and also to encourage firms to migrate to company format, I propose to reduce the income tax for smaller companies with annual turnover upto ` 50 crore to 25%."
22664,2017-18,"As per data of Assessment Year 201516, there are 6.94 lakh companies filing returns of which 6.67 lakh companies fall in this category and, therefore, percentagewise 96% of companies will get this benefit of lower taxation."
22665,2017-18,This will make our MSME sector more competitive as compared to large companies.
22666,2017-18,"The revenue forgone estimate for this measure is expected to be ` 7,200 crore per annum."
22667,2017-18,"In order to give a boost to banking sector, I propose to increase allowable provision for NonPerforming Asset from 7.5% to 8.5%."
22668,2017-18,This will reduce the tax liability of banks.
22669,2017-18,I also propose to tax interest receivable on actual receipt instead of accrual basis in respect of NPA accounts of all non scheduled cooperative banks also at par with scheduled banks.
22670,2017-18,This will remove hardship of having to pay tax even when interest income is not realised.
22671,2017-18,"Considering the wide range of use of LNG as fuel as well as feed stock for petrochemicals sector, I propose to reduce the basic customs duty on LNG from 5% to 2.5%."
22672,2017-18,"In order to incentivise domestic value addition and to promote Make in India, I propose to make changes in Customs & Central Excise duties in respect of certain items which are given in the Annex III of this speech."
22673,2017-18,Some of these proposals are also for addressing duty inversion.
22674,2017-18,There is a scheme of presumptive income tax for small and medium tax payers whose turnover is upto ` 2 crores.
22675,2017-18,"At present, 8% of their turnover is counted as presumptive income."
22676,2017-18,I propose to make this 6% in respect of turnover which is received by noncash means.
22677,2017-18,This benefit will be applicable for transactions undertaken in the current year also.
22678,2017-18,"I propose to limit the cash expenditure allowable as deduction, both for revenue as well as capital expenditure, to ` 10,000."
22679,2017-18,"Similarly, the limit of cash donation which can be received by a charitable trust is being reduced from ` 10,000/ to ` 2000/. 162."
22680,2017-18,The Special Investigation Team SIT set up by the Government for black money has suggested that no transaction above ` 3 lakh should be permitted in cash.
22681,2017-18,The Government has decided to accept this proposal.
22682,2017-18,Suitable amendment to the Incometax Act is proposed in the Finance Bill for enforcing this decision.
22683,2017-18,"To promote cashless transactions, I propose to exempt BCD, Excise/CV duty and SAD on miniaturised POS card reader for mPOS, micro ATM standards version 1.5.1, Finger Print Readers/Scanners and Iris Scanners."
22684,2017-18,"Simultaneously, I also propose to exempt parts and components for manufacture of such devices, so as to encourage domestic manufacturing of these devices."
22685,2017-18,Transparency in Electoral Funding 164.
22686,2017-18,India is the world’s largest democracy.
22687,2017-18,Political parties are an essential ingredient of a multiparty Parliamentary democracy.
22688,2017-18,"Even 70 years after Independence, the country has not been able to evolve a transparent method of funding political parties which is vital to the system of free and fair elections."
22689,2017-18,"An attempt was made in the past by amending the provisions of the Representation of Peoples Act, the Companies Act and the Income Tax Act to incentivise donations by individuals, partnership firms, HUFs and companies to political parties."
22690,2017-18,Both the donor and the donee were granted exemption from payment of tax if the accounts were transparently maintained and returns were filed with the competent authorities.
22691,2017-18,"Additionally, a list of donors who contributed more than `20,000/ to any party in cash or cheque is required to be maintained."
22692,2017-18,The 33 situation has only marginally improved since these provisions were brought into force.
22693,2017-18,Political parties continue to receive most of their funds through anonymous donations which are shown in cash.
22694,2017-18,"An effort, therefore, requires to be made to cleanse the system of political funding in India."
22695,2017-18,Donors have also expressed reluctance in donating by cheque or other transparent methods as it would disclose their identity and entail adverse consequences.
22696,2017-18,"I, therefore, propose the following scheme as an effort to cleanse the system of funding of political parties: a In accordance with the suggestion made by the Election Commission, the maximum amount of cash donation that a political party can receive will be `2000/ from one person."
22697,2017-18,"As an additional step, an amendment is being proposed to the Reserve Bank of India Act to enable the issuance of electoral bonds in accordance with a scheme that the Government of India would frame in this regard."
22698,2017-18,"Under this scheme, a donor could purchase bonds from authorised banks against cheque and digital payments only."
22699,2017-18,They shall be redeemable only in the designated account of a registered political party.
22700,2017-18,These bonds will be redeemable within the prescribed time limit from issuance of bond.
22701,2017-18,Every political party would have to file its return within the time prescribed in accordance with the provision of the Incometax Act.
22702,2017-18,Needless to say that the existing exemption to the political parties from payment of incometax would be available only subject to the fulfilment of these conditions.
22703,2017-18,"This reform will bring about greater transparency and accountability in political funding, while preventing future generation of black money."
22704,2017-18,Ease of Doing Business 166.
22705,2017-18,"As an antiavoidance measure, the provision of domestic transfer pricing in respect of related entities was brought in the Finance Act of 2012."
22706,2017-18,"Since then the number of entities being covered under domestic pricing has gone up substantially necessitating a longer scrutiny, which causes hardship to domestic companies."
22707,2017-18,"In order to reduce the compliance burden due to domestic transfer pricing provisions, I propose to restrict the scope of domestic transfer pricing only if one of the entities involved in related party transaction enjoys specified profitlinked deduction."
22708,2017-18,I propose to increase the threshold limit for audit of business entities who opt for presumptive income scheme from `1 crore to `2 crores.
22709,2017-18,"Similarly, the threshold for maintenance of books for individuals and HUF is being increased from turnover of `10 lakhs to `25 lakhs or income from `1.2 lakhs to `2.5 lakhs."
22710,2017-18,"In 2012, Incometax Act was amended to provide for taxation of those transactions of transfer of shares or interest in a foreign entity deriving its value substantially from Indian assets."
22711,2017-18,Apprehensions have been raised about some difficulties which arise because of this provision in case of transfer of stake of investors of Indiabased funds located abroad but investing in Indiabased companies.
22712,2017-18,"In order to remove this difficulty, I propose to exempt Foreign Portfolio Investor FPI Category I & II from indirect transfer provision."
22713,2017-18,I also propose to issue a clarification that indirect transfer provision shall not apply in case of redemption of shares or interests outside India as a result of or arising out of redemption or sale of investment in India which is chargeable to tax in India.
22714,2017-18,"As on today, a TDS of 5% is being deducted from commission payable to individual insurance agents even if the income of some of them may be below taxable limit."
22715,2017-18,I propose to exempt them from the requirement of TDS subject to their filing a selfdeclaration that their income is below taxable limit.
22716,2017-18,"Last year, I had announced a new scheme for presumptive taxation for professionals with receipt upto `50 lakhs p.a."
22717,2017-18,"In respect of such assesses, they are being given further benefit in terms of paying advance tax in one instalment instead of four."
22718,2017-18,"In order to allow the people to claim the refund expeditiously, the time period for revising a tax return is being reduced to 12 months from completion of financial year, at par with the time period for filing of return."
22719,2017-18,Also the time for completion of scrutiny assessments is being compressed further from 21 months to 18 months for Assessment Year 201819 and further to 12 months for Assessment Year 201920 and thereafter.
22720,2017-18,"While the Government is trying to bring within taxnet more people who are evading taxes, the present burden of taxation is mainly on honest tax payers and salaried employees who are showing their income correctly."
22721,2017-18,"Therefore, postdemonetisation, there is a legitimate expectation of this class of people to reduce their burden of taxation."
22722,2017-18,"Also an argument is 35 made that if a nominal rate of taxation is kept for lower slab, many more people will prefer to come within the tax net."
22723,2017-18,"I, therefore, propose to reduce the existing rate of taxation for individual assesses between income of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs to 5% from the present rate of 10%."
22724,2017-18,This would reduce the tax liability of all persons below `5 lakh income either to zero with rebate or 50% of their existing liability.
22725,2017-18,"In order not to have duplication of benefit, the existing benefit of rebate available to the same group of beneficiaries is being reduced to `2500 available only to assessees upto income of `3.5 lakhs."
22726,2017-18,"The combined effect of both these measures will mean that there would be zero tax liability for people getting income upto `3 lakhs p.a. and the tax liability will only be `2,500 for people with income between `3 and `3.5 lakhs."
22727,2017-18,If the limit of `1.5 lakh under Section 80C for investment is used fully the tax would be zero for people with income of `4.5 lakhs.
22728,2017-18,"While the taxation liability of people with income upto `5 lakhs is being reduced to half, all the other categories of tax payers in the subsequent slabs will also get a uniform benefit of `12,500/ per person."
22729,2017-18,"The total amount of tax foregone on account of this measure is `15,500 crores."
22730,2017-18,"In order to make good some of this revenue loss on account of this relief, I propose to levy a surcharge of 10% of tax payable on categories of individuals whose annual taxable income is between `50 lakhs and `1 crore."
22731,2017-18,The existing surcharge of 15% of Tax on people earning more than `1 crore will continue.
22732,2017-18,"This is likely to give additional revenue of `2,700 crores."
22733,2017-18,"In order to expand tax net, I also plan to have a simple onepage form to be filed as Income Tax Return for the category of individuals having taxable income upto `5 lakhs other than business income."
22734,2017-18,Also a person of this category who files income tax return for the first time would not be subjected to any scrutiny in the first year unless there is specific information available with the Department regarding his high value transaction.
22735,2017-18,I appeal to all citizens of India to contribute to Nation Building by making a small payment of 5% tax if their income is falling in the lowest slab of `2.5 lakhs to `5 lakhs.
22736,2017-18,Some other important proposals for amendment in Tax Laws which are not covered by me in my speech are given in Annex III of this speech.

22743,2017-18,It is my privilege to inform this august house that the GST Council has finalised its recommendations on almost all the issues based on consensus and after spirited debate and discussions.

22746,2017-18,"Centre, through the Central Board of Excise & Customs, shall continue to strive to achieve the goal of implementation of GST as per schedule without compromising the spirit of cooperative federalism."
22747,2017-18,Implementation of GST is likely to bring more taxes both to Central and State Governments because of widening of tax net.
22748,2017-18,I have preferred not to make many changes in current regime of Excise & Service Tax because the same are to be replaced by GST soon.
22749,2017-18,"In the Annual Conclave of Tax officers called ‘Rajaswa Gyan Sangam’ held in June 2016, the Prime Minister had expressed his desire to bring reforms in tax administration in the form of an approach of RAPID which stands for Revenue, Accountability, Probity, Information and Digitisation."
22750,2017-18,This approach precisely reflects the strategy of Tax Department which is now formulated.
22751,2017-18,"While revenue considerations always remain the focus of Revenue Department, we are trying to bring in maximum use of Information Technology to remove human contact with assesses as well as to plug tax avoidance."

22754,2017-18,We plan to enforce greater accountability of officers of Tax Department for specific act of commission and omission.
22755,2017-18,"I would like to assure everyone that honest, taxcompliant person would be treated with dignity and courtesy."
22756,2017-18,"Madam Speaker, my direct tax proposals for exemptions, etc. would result in revenue loss of `22,700 crore but after counting for revenue gain 37 of `2,700 crore for additional resource mobilisation proposal, the net revenue loss in direct tax would come to `20,000 crore."

23223,2018-19,"By including all filers as well as persons who did not file returns but paid tax by way of advance tax or TDS, we can derive the figure of Effective Taxpayer Base."
23224,2018-19,This number of effective tax payer base increased from 6.47 crores at the beginning of F.Y.1415 to 8.27 crores at the end of F.Y.1617.
23225,2018-19,We are enthused by this success of our measures and we pledge to continue to take all such measures in future by which the black money is contained and the honest taxpayers are rewarded.
23226,2018-19,Demonetization was received well by honest taxpayers as “imandari ka utsav” only for this reason.
23227,2018-19,"Madam Speaker, recognising the need for facilitating compliance, Government had liberalized the presumptive income scheme for small traders and entrepreneurs with annual turnover of less than `2 crores and introduced a similar scheme for professionals with annual turnover of less than `50 lakhs with the hope that there would be significant increase in compliance."
23228,2018-19,"Under this scheme, 41% more returns were filed during this year which shows that many more persons are joining the tax net under simplified scheme."
23229,2018-19,"However, the turnover shown is still not encouraging."
23230,2018-19,The tax compliance behaviour of professionals is no better; the department has received 5.68 lakh returns under the presumptive income scheme for assessment year 201718 with average gross receipts of `5.73 lakhs only.
23231,2018-19,"Average tax paid by them is only `35,000/. Tax incentive for promoting postharvest activities of agriculture 147."
23232,2018-19,"Madam Speaker, at present, hundred per cent deduction is allowed in respect of profit of cooperative societies which provide assistance to its members engaged in primary agricultural activities."
23233,2018-19,"Over the last few years, a number of Farmer Producer Companies have been set up along the lines of cooperative societies which also provide similar assistance to their members."
23234,2018-19,"In order to encourage professionalism in postharvest value addition in agriculture, I propose to allow hundred per cent deduction to these companies registered as Farmer Producer Companies and having annual turnover up to `100 crores in respect of their profit derived from such activities for a period of five years from financial year 201819."
23235,2018-19,This measure will encourage “Operation Greens” mission announced by me earlier and it will give a boost to Sampada Yojana.
23236,2018-19,"Currently, a deduction of 30% is allowed in addition to normal deduction of 100 % in respect of emoluments paid to eligible new employees who have been employed for a minimum period of 240 days during the year under section 80JJAA of the Incometax Act."
23237,2018-19,"However, the minimum period of employment is relaxed to 150 days in the case of apparel industry."
23238,2018-19,"In order to encourage creation of new employment, I propose to extend this relaxation to footwear and leather industry."
23239,2018-19,"Further, I also propose to rationalise this deduction of 30% by allowing the benefit for a new employee who is employed for less than the minimum period during the first year but continues to remain employed for the minimum period in subsequent year."
23240,2018-19,Incentive for real estate 149.
23241,2018-19,"Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in immovable property, the consideration or circle rate value, whichever is higher, is adopted and the difference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and seller."
23242,2018-19,"Sometimes, this variation can occur in respect of different properties 28 in the same area because of a variety of factors including shape of the plot and location."
23243,2018-19,"In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction, I propose to provide that no adjustment shall be made in a case where the circle rate value does not exceed 5% of the consideration."
23244,2018-19,"Incentivising micro, small and medium entrepreneurs 150."
23245,2018-19,"In the Union Budget, 2017, I had announced the reduction of corporate tax rate to 25% for companies whose turnover was less than `50 crore in financial year 201516."
23246,2018-19,This benefitted 96% of the total companies filing tax returns.
23247,2018-19,"Towards fulfilment of my promise to reduce corporate tax rate in a phased manner, I now propose to extend the benefit of this reduced rate of 25% also to companies who have reported turnover up to `250 crore in the financial year 201617."
23248,2018-19,"This will benefit the entire class of micro, small and medium enterprises which accounts for almost 99% of companies filing their tax returns."
23249,2018-19,"The estimate of revenue forgone due to this measure is `7,000 crores during the financial year 201819."
23250,2018-19,"After this, out of about 7 lakh companies filing returns, about 7,000 companies which file returns of income and whose turnover is above `250 crores will remain in 30% slab."
23251,2018-19,The lower corporate income tax rate for 99% of the companies will leave them with higher investible surplus which in turn will create more jobs.
23252,2018-19,Relief to salaried taxpayers 151.
23253,2018-19,The Government had made many positive changes in the personal incometax rate applicable to individuals in the last three years.
23254,2018-19,"Therefore, I do not propose to make any further change in the structure of the income tax rates for individuals."
23255,2018-19,There is a general perception in the society that individual business persons have better income as compared to salaried class.
23256,2018-19,"However, income tax data analysis suggests that major portion of personal incometax collection comes from the salaried class."
23257,2018-19,"For assessment year 201617, 1.89 crore salaried individuals have filed their returns and have paid total tax of `1.44 lakh crores which works out to average tax payment of `76,306/ per individual salaried taxpayer."
23258,2018-19,"As against this, 1.88 crores individual business taxpayers including professionals, who filed their returns for the same assessment year paid total tax of `48,000 crores which works out to an average tax payment of `25,753/ per individual business taxpayer."
23259,2018-19,"In order to provide relief to salaried taxpayers, I propose to allow a standard deduction of `40,000/ in lieu of the present exemption in respect of transport allowance and reimbursement of miscellaneous medical expenses."
23260,2018-19,"However, the transport 29 allowance at enhanced rate shall continue to be available to differently abled persons."
23261,2018-19,"Also other medical reimbursement benefits in case of hospitalization etc., for all employees shall continue."
23262,2018-19,"Apart from reducing paper work and compliance, this will help middle class employees even more in terms of reduction in their tax liability."
23263,2018-19,"This decision to allow standard deduction shall significantly benefit the pensioners also, who normally do not enjoy any allowance on account of transport and medical expenses."
23264,2018-19,"The revenue cost of this decision is approximately `8,000 crores."
23265,2018-19,The total number of salaried employees and pensioners who will benefit from this decision is around 2.5 crores.
23266,2018-19,Relief to senior citizen 152.
23267,2018-19,"A life with dignity is a right of every individual in general, more so for the senior citizens."
23268,2018-19,To care of those who cared for us is one of the highest honours.
23269,2018-19,"To further the objective of providing a dignified life, I propose to announce the following incentives for senior citizens:  Exemption of interest income on deposits with banks and post offices to be increased from `10,000/ to `50,000/ and TDS shall not be required to be deducted on such income, under section 194A."
23270,2018-19,This benefit shall be available also for interest from all fixed deposits schemes and recurring deposit schemes.
23271,2018-19,"Raising the limit of deduction for health insurance premium and/ or medical expenditure from `30,000/ to `50,000/, under section 80D."
23272,2018-19,"All senior citizens will now be able to claim benefit of deduction up to `50,000/ per annum in respect of any health insurance premium and/or any general medical expenditure incurred."
23273,2018-19,"Raising the limit of deduction for medical expenditure in respect of certain critical illness from, `60,000/ in case of senior citizens and from `80,000/ in case of very senior citizens, to `1 lakh in respect of all senior citizens, under section 80DDB."
23274,2018-19,"These concessions will give extra tax benefit of `4,000 crores to senior citizens."
23275,2018-19,"In addition to tax concessions, I propose to extend the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana up to March, 2020 under which an assured return of 8% is given by Life Insurance Corporation of India."
23276,2018-19,The existing limit on investment of `7.5 lakh per senior citizen under this scheme is also being enhanced to `15 lakh.
23277,2018-19,Tax incentive for International Financial Services Centre IFSC 30 153.
23278,2018-19,The Government had endeavoured to develop a world class international financial services centre in India.
23279,2018-19,"In recent years, various measures including tax incentives have been provided in order to fulfil this objective."
23280,2018-19,"To further this objective, I propose to provide two more concessions for IFSC."
23281,2018-19,"In order to promote trade in stock exchanges located in IFSC, I propose to exempt transfer of derivatives and certain securities by nonresidents from capital gains tax."
23282,2018-19,"Further, noncorporate taxpayers operating in IFSC shall be charged Alternate Minimum Tax AMT at concessional rate of 9% at par with Minimum Alternate Tax MAT applicable for corporates."
23283,2018-19,Further Measures to control cash economy: 154.
23284,2018-19,"Currently, the income of trusts and institutions is exempt if they utilise their income towards their objects in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Incometax Act."
23285,2018-19,"However, there is no restriction on these entities for incurring expenditure in cash."
23286,2018-19,"In order to have audit trail of the expenses incurred by these entities, it is proposed that payments exceeding `10,000/ in cash made by such entities shall be disallowed and the same shall be subject to tax."
23287,2018-19,"Further, in order to improve TDS compliance by these entities, I propose to provide that in case of nondeduction of tax, 30% of the amount shall be disallowed and the same shall be taxed."
23288,2018-19,Rationalisation of Long Term Capital Gains LTCG 155.
23289,2018-19,"Madam Speaker, currently, long term capital gains arising from transfer of listed equity shares, units of equity oriented fund and unit of a business trust are exempt from tax."
23290,2018-19,"With the reforms introduced by the Government and incentives given so far, the equity market has become buoyant."
23291,2018-19,"The total amount of exempted capital gains from listed shares and units is around `3,67,000 crores as per returns filed for A.Y.1718."
23292,2018-19,Major part of this gain has accrued to corporates and LLPs.
23293,2018-19,"This has also created a bias against manufacturing, leading to more business surpluses being invested in financial assets."
23294,2018-19,The return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption.
23295,2018-19,There is therefore a strong case for bringing long term capital gains from listed equities in the tax net.
23296,2018-19,"However, recognising the fact that vibrant equity market is essential for economic growth, I propose only a modest change in the present regime."
23297,2018-19,I propose to tax such long term capital gains exceeding `1 lakh at the rate of 10% without allowing the benefit of any indexation.
23298,2018-19,"However, all gains up to 31st January, 2018 will be grandfathered."
23299,2018-19,"For example, if an equity share is purchased six months before 31st January, 2018 at `100/ and the highest price quoted on 31st January, 2018 in respect of this share is `120/, there 31 will be no tax on the gain of `20/ if this share is sold after one year from the date of purchase."
23300,2018-19,"However, any gain in excess of `20 earned after 31st January, 2018 will be taxed at 10% if this share is sold after 31st July, 2018."
23301,2018-19,The gains from equity share held up to one year will remain short term capital gain and will continue to be taxed at the rate of 15%.
23302,2018-19,"Further, I also propose to introduce a tax on distributed income by equity oriented mutual fund at the rate of 10%."
23303,2018-19,This will provide level playing field across growth oriented funds and dividend distributing funds.
23304,2018-19,"In view of grandfathering, this change in capital gain tax will bring marginal revenue gain of about `20,000 crores in the first year."
23305,2018-19,The revenues in subsequent years may be more.
23306,2018-19,Health and Education Cess 156.
23307,2018-19,"Madam Speaker, at present there is a three per cent cess on personal income tax and corporation tax consisting of two per cent cess for primary education and one per cent cess for secondary and higher education."
23308,2018-19,"In order to take care of the needs of education and health of BPL and rural families, I have announced programs in Part A of my speech."
23309,2018-19,"To fund this, I propose to increase the cess by one per cent."
23310,2018-19,The existing three per cent education cess will be replaced by a four per cent “Health and Education Cess” to be levied on the tax payable.
23311,2018-19,"This will enable us to collect an estimated additional amount of `11,000 crores."
23312,2018-19,"We had introduced eassessment in 2016 on a pilot basis and in 2017, extended it to 102 cities with the objective of reducing the interface between the department and the taxpayers."
23313,2018-19,"With the experience gained so far, we are now ready to roll out the Eassessment across the country, which will transform the ageold assessment procedure of the income tax department and the manner in which they interact with taxpayers and other stakeholders."
23314,2018-19,"Accordingly, I propose to amend the Incometax Act to notify a new scheme for assessment where the assessment will be done in electronic mode which will almost eliminate person to person contact leading to greater efficiency and transparency."
23315,2018-19,My other tax proposals on direct tax are listed in Annexure 5 of my speech.
23316,2018-19,"On the Indirect Taxes side, this is the first budget after the roll out of the Goods and Service Tax."
23317,2018-19,"Excise duties to a large extent and service tax 32 have been subsumed in GST, along with corresponding duties on imports."
23318,2018-19,"Hence, my budget proposals are mainly on the customs side."
23319,2018-19,"In this budget, I am making a calibrated departure from the underlying policy in the last two decades, wherein the trend largely was to reduce the customs duty."
23320,2018-19,"There is substantial potential for domestic value addition in certain sectors, like food processing, electronics, auto components, footwear and furniture."
23321,2018-19,"To further incentivise the domestic value addition and Make in India in some such sectors, I propose to increase customs duty on certain items."
23322,2018-19,"I propose to increase customs duty on mobile phones from 15% to 20%, on some of their parts and accessories to 15% and on certain parts of TVs to 15%."
23323,2018-19,This measure will promote creation of more jobs in the country.
23324,2018-19,Details of changes made in rates of customs duty as well as certain changes made in the excise duty structure are given in Annexure 6 to my speech.
23325,2018-19,"To help the cashew processing industry, I propose to reduce customs duty on raw cashew from 5% to 2.5%."
23326,2018-19,"I propose to abolish the Education Cess and Secondary and Higher Education Cess on imported goods, and in its place impose a Social Welfare Surcharge, at the rate of 10% of the aggregate duties of Customs, on imported goods, to provide for social welfare schemes of the Government."
23327,2018-19,"Goods which were hitherto exempt from Education Cesses on imported goods will, however, be exempt from this Surcharge."
23328,2018-19,"In addition, certain specified goods, mentioned in the Annexure 6 to my speech will attract the proposed Surcharge at the rate of 3% of the aggregate duties of customs only."
23329,2018-19,"I also propose to make certain changes to the Customs Act, 1962, to further improve ease of doing business in cross border trade, and to align certain provisions with the commitments under the Trade Facilitation Agreement."
23330,2018-19,"To smoothen dispute resolution processes and to reduce litigation, certain amendments are being made, to provide for prenotice consultation, definite timelines for adjudication and deemed closure of cases if those timelines are not adhered to."
23331,2018-19,"With the roll out of GST, I propose to change the name of Central Board of Excise and Customs [CBEC] to Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs CBIC."
23332,2018-19,The necessary changes in law for this are proposed in the Finance Bill.
23333,2018-19,"Madam, while making the proposals in this year’s Budget, we have been guided by our mission to especially strengthen agriculture, rural 33 development, health, education, employment, MSME and infrastructure sectors of Indian economy."
23334,2018-19,I am sure the New India which we aspire to create now will emerge.
23335,2018-19,"Swami Vivekanand had also envisioned decades ago in his Memoirs of European Travel, ‘‘You merge yourselves in the void and disappear, and let new India arise in your place."
23336,2018-19,"Let her arise – out of the peasants’ cottage, grasping the plough; out of the huts of the fisherman."
23337,2018-19,"Let her spring from the grocer’s shop, from beside the oven of the fritter seller."
23338,2018-19,"Let her emanate from the factory, from marts, and from markets."
23339,2018-19,"Let her emerge from groves and forests, from hills and mountains’’."
23340,2018-19,"With these words, Madam Speaker, I commend the Budget to the House."
23341,2019-20,I rise to present the Budget for the year 201920.
23342,2019-20,"The recent election which brought us to this august House today, was charged with brimming hope and desire for a bright and stable New India."
23343,2019-20,"Like never before, India celebrated its democracy by coming out to vote in large numbers, like never before."
23344,2019-20,Voter turnout was the highest at 67.9%.
23345,2019-20,"Every section – young, old, first time voters, voters since the first General Election, women – all turned up to stamp their approval of a performing Government."
23346,2019-20,Through their unambiguous and firm mandate they have reaffirmed “putting the nation first”.
23347,2019-20,The people of India have validated the two goals for our country’s future: that of national society and economic growth.
23348,2019-20,"Between 201419, we provided a rejuvenated CentreState dynamic, cooperative federalism, GST Council, and a strident commitment to fiscal discipline."
23349,2019-20,"We had set the ball rolling for a New India, planned and assisted by the NITI Aayog, a broad based think tank."
23350,2019-20,"We have showed by our deeds that the principle “Reform, Perform, Transform” can succeed."
23351,2019-20,On many programmes and initiatives we had worked on unprecedented scale.
23352,2019-20,Average amount spent on food security per year approximately doubled during 201419 compared to the preceding five years.
23353,2019-20,Number of patents issued more than trebled in 201718 as against the number of patents issued in 2014.
23354,2019-20,Our last mile delivery stood out and the unknown citizen in every nook and corner of our country felt the difference.
23355,2019-20,"Our objective was, and continues to be, àÉVÉ¤ÉÚiÉ nä¶É BÉäE ÉÊãÉA àÉVÉ¤ÉÚiÉ xÉÉMÉÉÊ®BÉE* 5."
23356,2019-20,Mega programmes and services which we initiated and delivered during those 5 years will now be further accelerated.
23357,2019-20,"We shall further simplify procedures, incentivize performance, reduce redtape and make the best use of technology just as we did earlier."
23358,2019-20,I am confident we will achieve our goals.
23359,2019-20,Chankaya Niti Sutra too says: “Karya purusha karena lakshyam sampadyate.”
23360,2019-20,"Meaning “with determined human efforts, the task will surely be completed.”"
23361,2019-20,"An Urdu couplet reads: “aÉCÉEÉÒxÉ cÉä iÉÉä BÉEÉä<Ç ®ÉoiÉÉ ÉÊxÉBÉEãÉiÉÉ cè, c ́ÉÉ BÉEÉÒ +ÉÉä]"
23362,2019-20,Our economy was at approximately US$ 1.85 trillion when we formed the Government in 2014.
23363,2019-20,Within 5 years it has reached US$ 2.7 trillion.
23364,2019-20,"Hence, it is well within our capacity to reach the US$ 5 trillion in the next few years."
23365,2019-20,"In the interim Budget of 201920 presented in February 2019, we gave ourselves a Vision for the Decade."
23366,2019-20,I flag here the ten points of our Vision laid before us:
23367,2019-20,"Building physical and social infrastructure; Digital India reaching every sector of the economy; PollutionfreeIndiawithgreenMotherEarthandBlueSkies; Make in India with particular emphasis on MSMEs, Startups, defence manufacturing, automobiles, electronics, fabs and batteries, and medical devices; Water, water management, clean Rivers; BlueEconomy; Space programmes, Gaganyan, Chandrayan and Satellite programmes; Selfsufficiency and export of foodgrains, pulses, oilseeds, fruits and vegetables; Healthy society – Ayushman Bharat, wellnourished women & children."
23368,2019-20,Safety of citizens; Team India with Jan Bhagidari.
23369,2019-20,"With this Vision set before us and with the mandate given by its people, we are determined to take India to that height that it richly deserves."
23370,2019-20,I strongly believe that with the clear headed leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister we can achieve our goal.
23371,2019-20,The Indian economy will grow to become a 3 trillion dollar economyin the current year.
23372,2019-20,It is now the sixth largest in the world.
23373,2019-20,"Five years ago, it was at the 11th position."
23374,2019-20,"In Purchasing Power Parity terms, we are in fact, the 3rd largest economy already, only next to China and the USA. 9."
23375,2019-20,To attain this and more we need to continue undertaking many structural reforms.
23376,2019-20,"In the last five years, we saw many big reforms in particular, in indirect taxation, bankruptcy and real estate."
23377,2019-20,"While these reforms were happening here in the Parliament, the common man’s life was being changed through MUDRA loans to help him do his business, and through several programmes it was being ensured that his/her kitchen had become smokeless, his/her house got electricity connection and women’s dignity was respected with the provision of toilets in homes."
23378,2019-20,The common man was served even as major transformational reforms were being rolled out.
23379,2019-20,"And for this to continue we need to invest heavily in infrastructure, in digital economy and on job creation in small and medium firms."
23380,2019-20,"Respected Speaker Sir, it took over 55 years for the Indian economy to reach 1 trillion dollar but when the country and her people’s hearts are filled with aasha, vishwas and aakansha that is, when hearts are filled with hope, trust and aspirations, we, in 5 years, added 1 trillion dollar."
23381,2019-20,Today we are nearing a 3 trillion dollar level.
23382,2019-20,"So when we aspire to reach a 5 trillion dollar level, many wonder if it is possible."
23383,2019-20,"If we can appreciate our citizens’ ""purusharth” or their “goals of human pursuit” filled with their inherent desire to progress led by the dedicated leadership present in this House, the target is eminently achievable."
23384,2019-20,"All of India’s private sector industries – small, medium or large – have played a substantial role in growing our economy."
23385,2019-20,"I recall the words of an eminent industry leader, who said that his company’s growth has always aligned itself with India’s growth, before and postindependence."
23386,2019-20,"So if beforeindependence, India Inc. understood ‘Swadeshi’, today they understand ‘Make in India’."
23387,2019-20,We do not look down upon legitimate profit earning.
23388,2019-20,Gone are the days of policy paralysis and licensequotacontrol regimes.
23389,2019-20,India Inc. are India’s jobcreators.
23390,2019-20,They are the nation’s wealth creators.
23391,2019-20,"Together, with mutual trust, we can gain, catalyze fast and attain sustained national growth."
23392,2019-20,I wish to propose a number of initiatives as part of a framework for kickstarting the virtuous cycle of domestic and foreign investments.
23393,2019-20,Connectivity is the lifeblood of an economy.
23394,2019-20,"The Government has given a massive push to all forms of physical connectivity through Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, industrial corridors, dedicated freight corridors, Bhartamala and Sagarmala projects, Jal Marg Vikas and UDAN Schemes."
23395,2019-20,"While the industrial corridors would improve infrastructure availability for greater industrial investment in the catchment regions, the dedicated freight corridors would mitigate the congestion of our railway network benefitting the common man."
23396,2019-20,"The ambitious programme of Bharatmala would help develop national road corridors and highways, while Sagarmala would enhance port connectivity, modernization and portlinked industrialization."
23397,2019-20,"If Sagarmala is aimed at improving the infrastructure for external trade, equally it is the poor man’s transport too."

23769,2019-20,"With a view to further incentivising the IFSC, I propose to further provide several direct tax incentives to an IFSC including 100 % profitlinked deduction under section 80LA in any tenyear block within a fifteenyear period, exemption from dividend distribution tax from current and accumulated income to companies and mutual funds, exemptions on capital gain to CategoryIII AIF and interest payment on loan taken from nonresidents."
23770,2019-20,Securities Transaction Tax STT 120.
23771,2019-20,I propose to give relief in levy of Securities Transaction Tax STT by restricting it only to the difference between settlement and strike price in case of exercise of options.
23772,2019-20,Simplification and Ease of living 121.
23773,2019-20,India’s Ease of Doing Business ranking under the category of ‘paying taxes’ showed a significant jump from 172 in 2017 to 121 in the 2019.
23774,2019-20,I now propose to implement series of measures that will leverage technology to make compliance easier for the taxpayers.
23775,2019-20,Interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar 122.
23776,2019-20,"Mr Speaker, Sir, more than 120 Crore Indians now have Aadhaar."
23777,2019-20,"Therefore, for ease and convenience of tax payers, I propose to make PAN and Aadhaar interchangeable and allow those who do not have PAN to file Income Tax returns by simply quoting their Aadhaar number and also use it wherever they are required to quote PAN."
23778,2019-20,Prefilling of Incometax Returns 123.
23779,2019-20,"Prefilled tax returns will be made available to taxpayers which will contain details of salary income, capital gains from securities, bank interests, and dividends etc. and tax deductions."
23780,2019-20,"Information regarding these incomes will be collected from the concerned sources such as Banks, Stock exchanges, mutual funds, EPFO, State Registration Departments etc."
23781,2019-20,"This will not only significantly reduce the time taken to file a tax return, but will also ensure accuracy of reporting of income and taxes."
23782,2019-20,"The existing system of scrutiny assessments in the Incometax Department involves a high level of personal interaction between the taxpayer and the Department, which leads to certain undesirable practices on the part of tax officials."
23783,2019-20,"To eliminate such instances, and to give shape to the vision of the Hon’ble Prime Minister, a scheme of faceless assessment in electronic mode involving no human interface is being launched this year in a phased manner."
23784,2019-20,"To start with, such e assessments shall be carried out in cases requiring verification of certain specified transactions or discrepancies."
23785,2019-20,"Cases selected for scrutiny shall be allocated to assessment units in a random manner and notices shall be issued electronically by a Central Cell, without disclosing the name, designation or location of the Assessing Officer."
23786,2019-20,The Central Cell shall be the single point of contact between the taxpayer and the Department.
23787,2019-20,This new scheme of assessment will represent a paradigm shift in the functioning of the Income Tax Department.
23788,2019-20,"Mr. Speaker, Sir, our Government has taken a number of initiatives in the recent past for the promotion of digital payments and less cash economy."
23789,2019-20,"To promote digital payments further, I propose to take a slew of measures."
23790,2019-20,"To discourage the practice of making business payments in cash, I propose to levy TDS of 2% on cash withdrawal exceeding 1 crore in a year from a bank account."
23791,2019-20,"Further, there are lowcost digital modes of payment such as BHIM UPI, UPIQR Code, Aadhaar Pay, certain Debit cards, NEFT, RTGS etc. which can be used to promote less cash economy."
23792,2019-20,"I, therefore, propose that the business establishments with annual turnover more than 50 crore shall offer such low cost digital modes of payment to their customers and no charges or Merchant Discount Rate shall be imposed on customers as well as merchants."
23793,2019-20,RBI and Banks will absorb these costs from the savings that will accrue to them on account of handling less cash as people move to these digital modes of payment.
23794,2019-20,"Necessary amendments are being made in the Income Tax Act and the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to give effect to these provisions."
23795,2019-20,"Mr Speaker Sir, as I have stated earlier, we have taken several measures in the past to alleviate the tax burden on small and medium incomeearners as those having annual income up to 5 lakh are not required to pay any incometax."
23796,2019-20,We are thankful to the taxpayers who play a major role in nation building by paying their taxes.
23797,2019-20,"However, in view of rising income levels, those in the highest income brackets, need to contribute more to the Nation’s development."
23798,2019-20,"I, therefore, propose to enhance surcharge on individuals having taxable income from 2 crore to 5 crore and 5 crore and above so that effective tax rates for these two categories will increase by around 3 % and 7 % respectively."
23799,2019-20,I also propose to simplify the tax law to reduce genuine hardships being caused to taxpayers which include enhancing threshold of tax for launching prosecution for nonfiling of returns and exempting appropriate class of persons from the antiabuse provisions of section 50CA and section 56 of the Income Tax Act.
23800,2019-20,"Now coming to Indirect Tax, we are aware that the landscape has changed significantly with implementation of GST."
23801,2019-20,"In every sense, this has been a monumental reform."
23802,2019-20,Centre and States coming together and agreeing to pool in their sovereign power of taxation for common good of the country was unprecedented.
23803,2019-20,Multitude of rates instantly became four.
23804,2019-20,Almost all commodities saw rate reduction.
23805,2019-20,Tens of returns were replaced by one.
23806,2019-20,Taxpayer’s interface with tax departments got reduced.
23807,2019-20,"Goods started moving freely across states, which saved time and energy."
23808,2019-20,A truck started doing two trips in the same time in which it was doing one.
23809,2019-20,"Thus, dream of one nation, one tax, one market was realised."
23810,2019-20,The GST Council deserves all the credit for this.
23811,2019-20,In the initial phase GST witnessed certain teething problems.
23812,2019-20,This was natural considering the scale of the reform.
23813,2019-20,"However, the Council, Centre and States proactively worked to resolve these issues."
23814,2019-20,"GST rates have also been reduced significantly, where relief of about 92,000 crore per year has been given."
23815,2019-20,We should not lose sight of this fact while judging the performance of GST.
23816,2019-20,The details are given in the annexure.
23817,2019-20,We are further simplifying the GST processes.
23818,2019-20,A simplified single monthly return is being rolled out.
23819,2019-20,Taxpayer having annual turnover of less than 5 crore shall file quarterly return.

23821,2019-20,A fully automated GST refund module shall be implemented.
23822,2019-20,Multiple tax ledgers for a taxpayer shall be replaced by one.
23823,2019-20,It is also proposed to move to an electronic invoice system wherein invoice details will be captured in a central system at the time of issuance.
23824,2019-20,This will eventually be used to prefill the taxpayer’s returns.
23825,2019-20,There will be no need for a separate eway bill.
23826,2019-20,"Its roll out would begin from January, 2020."
23827,2019-20,Electronic invoice system will significantly reduce the compliance burden.
23828,2019-20,"On the Customs side my proposals are driven with the objectives of securing our borders, achieving higher domestic value addition through make in India, reducing import dependence, protection to MSME sector, promoting clean energy, curbing nonessential imports, and correcting inversions."
23829,2019-20,Defence has an immediate requirement of modernisation and upgradation.
23830,2019-20,This is a national priority.
23831,2019-20,"For this purpose, import of defence equipment that are not being manufactured in India are being exempted from the basic customs duty."
23832,2019-20,Make in India is a cherished goal.
23833,2019-20,"In order to provide domestic industry a level playing field, basic customs duty is being increased on items such as cashew kernels, PVC, Vinyl flooring, tiles, metal fittings, mountings for furniture, auto parts, certain kinds of synthetic rubbers, marble slabs, optical fibre cable, CCTV camera, IP camera, digital and network video recorders etc."
23834,2019-20,"Also, exemptions from custom duty on certain electronic items which are now being manufactured in India are being withdrawn."
23835,2019-20,"Further, end use based exemptions on palm stearin, fatty oils, and exemptions to various kinds of papers are also being withdrawn."
23836,2019-20,"To encourage domestic publishing and printing industry, 5 % custom duty is being imposed on imported books."
23837,2019-20,"To further promote domestic manufacturing, customs duty reductions are being proposed on certain raw materials and capital goods."
23838,2019-20,"These include certain inputs of CRGO sheets, amorphous alloy ribbon, ethylene dichloride, propylene oxide, cobalt matte, naphtha, wool fibres, inputs for manufacture of artificial kidney and disposable sterilised dialyser, and fuels for nuclear power plants."
23839,2019-20,"To further incentivise emobility, customs duty is being exempted on certain parts of electric vehicles."
23840,2019-20,Customs duty is also being exempted on capital goods required for manufacture of specified electronic goods.
23841,2019-20,Export duty is being rationalised on raw and semifinished leather to provide relief to this sector.
23842,2019-20,Crude prices have softened from their highs.
23843,2019-20,This gives me a room to review excise duty and cess on petrol and diesel.
23844,2019-20,I propose to increase Special Additional Excise duty and Road and Infrastructure Cess each by one rupee a litre on petrol and diesel.
23845,2019-20,It is also proposed to increase custom duty on gold and other precious metals from 10% to 12.5%.
23846,2019-20,Tobacco products and crude attract National Calamity and Contingent duty.
23847,2019-20,In certain cases this levy has been contested on the ground that there is no basic excise duty on these items.
23848,2019-20,"To address this issue, a nominal basic excise duty is being imposed."
23849,2019-20,I am also proposing few amendments to the Customs Act.
23850,2019-20,Recent trends reveal that certain bogus entities are resorting to unfair practices to avail undue concessions and export incentives.
23851,2019-20,"While we have intensified our efforts against such nefarious activities, provisions are being incorporated in the Act for enhanced penalty and prosecution for such offences."
23852,2019-20,"Further, misuse of duty free scrips and drawback facility involving more than fifty lakh rupees will be a cognizable and non bailable offence."
23853,2019-20,GST has just completed two years.
23854,2019-20,An area that concerns me is that we have huge pending litigations from preGST regime.
23855,2019-20,More than 3.75 lakh crore is blocked in litigations in service tax and excise.
23856,2019-20,There is a need to unload this baggage and allow business to move on.
23857,2019-20,"I, therefore, propose, a Legacy Dispute Resolution Scheme that will allow quick closure of these litigations."
23858,2019-20,I would urge the trade and business to avail this opportunity and be free from legacy litigations.
23859,2019-20,The details of my tax proposals are given in the Annexure.
23860,2019-20,"Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to this august House."
23861,2020-21,I rise to present the Budget for the year 20202021.
23862,2020-21,"Introduction In May 2019, Prime Minister Modi received a massive mandate to form the government again."
23863,2020-21,"With renewed vigour, under his leadership, we commit ourselves to serve the people of India, with all humility and dedication."

23869,2020-21,"This vibrant India shall be a caring society which shall attend to its weak, the old and the vulnerable among its citizens."
23870,2020-21,"During 201419, our government brought in a paradigm shift in governance."
23871,2020-21,This shift was characterised by a twin focus: fundamental structural reform and inclusive growth.
23872,2020-21,Inflation has been well contained.
23873,2020-21,Banks saw a thorough cleaning up of accumulated loans of the past decade and then they were recapitalized.
23874,2020-21,Companies were provided an exit through the IBC.
23875,2020-21,Several steps on the formalisation of the economy were taken up.
23876,2020-21,"Of the structural reforms, the Goods and Services Tax GST has been the most historic in our country."
23877,2020-21,Its chief architect is not with us today.
23878,2020-21,I pay homage to the visionary leader late Shri Arun Jaitley ji.
23879,2020-21,"At the time of roll out of GST, he had said and I quote: “It will be an India where the Centre and States will work harmoniously towards the common goal of shared prosperity."
23880,2020-21,The unanimity of the Constitutional amendment and the consensus of the GST Council highlights that India can rise above narrow politics for the nation’s interest.
23881,2020-21,"With the GST, neither the state nor the Centre loses its sovereignty."
23882,2020-21,"In contrast, they will pool their sovereignty on decisions on indirect taxes.”"
23883,2020-21,"True to this vision for the historic structural reform, the Goods and Services Tax has been gradually maturing into a tax that has integrated the country economically."
23884,2020-21,It has consolidated numerous taxes and cesses to one tax and facilitated formalization of economy.
23885,2020-21,It has resulted in the efficiency gains in logistic and transport sectors.
23886,2020-21,The turnaround time for trucks has witnessed a substantial reduction to the tune of 20% due to abolition of check posts in GST.
23887,2020-21,The dreaded InspectorRaj has also vanished.
23888,2020-21,It has also led to significant benefits to MSME by way of enhanced threshold and composition limits.
23889,2020-21,The effective tax incidence on almost every commodity came down substantially.
23890,2020-21,"Through several rate reductions, an annual benefit of ` one lakh crore has been extended to consumers."
23891,2020-21,It amounts to 10% reduction in overall tax incidence.
23892,2020-21,An average household now saves about 4% on its monthly spends on account of reduced GST rates.
23893,2020-21,"During this phase of maturing, GST did face certain challenges."
23894,2020-21,This was natural as transition was daunting.
23895,2020-21,GST Council has been proactive in resolving issues during transition.
23896,2020-21,"In the last two years we have added more than 60 lakh new taxpayers, a total of about 40 crore returns were 3 filed, 800 crore invoices were uploaded, and 105 crore eway bills were generated."
23897,2020-21,There has been extensive engagement with stakeholders.
23898,2020-21,"A simplified new return system is being introduced from April 1, 2020."
23899,2020-21,A former Prime Minister had once voiced a concern that the fruits of the welfare schemes were not reaching the intended citizens – the common and deserving citizen was only receiving 15 paisa of every rupee sent for him.
23900,2020-21,"Guided by “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas”, our government and our Prime Minister added manifold speed and scaled up the implementation of schemes and programmes that directly benefitted the poor and the disadvantaged."
23901,2020-21,"I wish to list out only a few as examples: a welfare schemes with Direct Benefit Transfer DBT embedded in them; b sanitation and water as provision of basic needs and as a measure of preventive healthcare; c healthcare, through Ayushman Bharat; d clean energy through Ujjwala and solar power; e financial inclusion, credit support, insurance protection to vulnerable sections and pension scheme; f digital penetration with broadband and UPI; g Affordable Housing for all through PMAY."
23902,2020-21,"The milestones achieved are unprecedented, globally recognised and benchmarked against international indices."
23903,2020-21,"This strategy, changed the established order of a few individuals cornering most of the benefits and was appreciated by the people."
23904,2020-21,This had immensely positive outcomes.
23905,2020-21,We have moved on from a growth rate of just over 4% in 1950s to 6% in 1980s and1990s.
23906,2020-21,"However, during 201419 we clocked growth of 7.4% on average with inflation, averaging around 4.5%."
23907,2020-21,It is worthwhile to note that inflation was close to 9% in the last two decades of the last millennium and ranged 10.5% during 200914.
23908,2020-21,"Between 200616, India was able to raise 271 million people out of poverty, which we all should be proud of."
23909,2020-21,We are now the fifth largest economy of the world.

23912,2020-21,"With this backdrop, our government shall work towards taking the country forward so that we can leapfrog to the next level of health, prosperity and wellbeing."
23913,2020-21,We shall strive to bring Ease of living for every citizen.
23914,2020-21,"I am mindful of presenting this budget in the backdrop of two cross cutting developments: a b Proliferation of technologies, specially analytics, machine learning, robotics, bioinformatics and Artificial Intelligence; and The number of people in the productive age group i.e. 1565 years in India, being at its highest."
23915,2020-21,"This budget is woven around three prominent themes:One: Aspirational India in which all sections of the society seek better standards of living, with access to health, education and better jobs."
23916,2020-21,"Two: Economic development for all, indicated in the Prime Minister’s exhortation of “Sabka Saath , Sabka Vikas , Sabka Vishwas”."
23917,2020-21,This would entail reforms across swathes of the economy.
23918,2020-21,"Simultaneously, it would mean yielding more space for the private sector."
23919,2020-21,"Together, they would ensure higher productivity and greater efficiency."
23920,2020-21,AND Three: Ours shall be a Caring Society that is both humane and compassionate.

23926,2020-21,Each one of these initiatives and their components would be bench marked to international standards and the indices would be announced soon.
23927,2020-21,This combination is special to contemporary India.
23928,2020-21,"Across the world, if there is a shrinking of globalisation, equally, there is a debate on the efficacy of monetary policy too."
23929,2020-21,"The efforts we have made in the last five years and the energy, enthusiasm and the innovation of our youth are the ignition required to push forward."
23930,2020-21,The Indian spirit of entrepreneurship which weathered several storms over the centuries inspire and motivate us.
23931,2020-21,We recognise the need to support and further energise this spirit.

23937,2020-21,The chapter on Finances and subsequent Part B on Taxes provide the necessary underpinning to the Budget that lays the guide map for next year and beyond.
23938,2020-21,"Before, I move to elaborate on each of the three themes, I wish to recite a small verse in Kashmiri: Saun Watan Gulzar Shalamaar Hyur Dal Manz Pholvun Pamposh Hyuv Navjavananhund, Vushun Khumaar Hyuv Myon Watan, Chyon WatanSaun Watan, Nundbony Watan Everything that we do, all of us do, is for this beautiful country Poem by Pandit Dinanath Koul  Aspirational India 6 21."

24386,2020-21,"In continuation of the reform measures already taken so far, the tax proposals in this budget will introduce further reforms to stimulate growth, simplify tax structure, bring ease of compliance, and reduce litigations."
24387,2020-21,Personal Income Tax and simplification of taxation 
24388,2020-21,"In the interim Budget of 2019, our government exempted individuals having income up to ` 5 Lakh from paying any income tax."
24389,2020-21,"Presently, an individual pays 20% on income between ` 5 Lakh to ` 10 Lakh and 30% on income above ` 10 Lakh."
24390,2020-21,"Further, currently the Income Tax Act is riddled with various exemptions and deductions which make compliance by the taxpayer and administration of the Income Tax Act by the tax authorities a 33 burdensome process."
24391,2020-21,It is almost impossible for a taxpayer to comply with the Incometax law without taking help from professionals.
24392,2020-21,"In order to provide significant relief to the individual taxpayers and to simplify the Incometax law, I propose to bring a new and simplified personal income tax regime wherein income tax rates will be significantly reduced for the individual taxpayers who forgo certain deductions and exemptions."
24393,2020-21,"Under the new regime, an individual shall be required to pay tax at the reduced rate of 10% for income between ` 5 Lakh to ` 7. 5 Lakh against the current rate of 20%."
24394,2020-21,For income between ` 7.5 Lakh to ` 10 Lakh he will pay at the reduced rate of 15% against the current rate of 20 %.
24395,2020-21,Similarly for the income between ` 10 Lakh to ` 12.5 Lakh the taxpayer will pay at the reduced rate of 20% against the current rate of 30 %.
24396,2020-21,The income between ` 12.5 Lakh to ` 15 Lakh will be taxed at the reduced rate of 25% against the existing rate of 30 %.
24397,2020-21,Incomes above ` 15 lakh will be continued to be taxed at the rate of 30 %.
24398,2020-21,Those earning up to ` 5 lakhs shall not pay any tax either in the old regime or in the new regime.
24399,2020-21,The proposed tax structure will provide significant relief to taxpayers and more so to those in the middle class.   
24400,2020-21,Taxable Income Slab ` 02.5 Lakh 2.55 Lakh 57.5 Lakh 7.510 Lakh 1012.5 Lakh 12.515 Lakh Above 15 Lakh Existing Tax Rates Exempt 5% 20% 20% 30% 30% 30% New Tax Rates Exempt 5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30%                         34 
24401,2020-21,"In the new tax regime, substantial tax benefit will accrue to a taxpayer depending upon exemptions and deductions claimed by him."
24402,2020-21,"For example, a person earning ` 15 lakh in a year and not availing any deductions etc. will pay only `, 1,95,000 as compared to `, 2,73,000 in the old regime."
24403,2020-21,"Thus his tax burden shall be reduced by 78,000 in the new regime."
24404,2020-21,He would still be the gainer in the new regime even if he was taking deduction of ` 1.5 Lakh under various sections of Chapter VIA of the Income Tax Act under the old regime.
24405,2020-21,The new tax regime shall be optional for the taxpayers.
24406,2020-21,An individual who is currently availing more deductions & exemption under the Income Tax Act may choose to avail them and continue to pay tax in the old regime.
24407,2020-21,"The new personal income tax rates will entail estimated revenue forgone of ` 40,000 crore per year."
24408,2020-21,We have also initiated measures to prefill the income tax return so that an individual who opts for the new regime would need no assistance from an expert to file his return and pay income tax.
24409,2020-21,"In order to simplify income tax system, I have reviewed all the exemptions and deductions which got incorporated in the income tax legislation over the past several decades."
24410,2020-21,It was surprising to know that currently more than one hundred exemptions and deductions of different nature are provided in the Incometax Act.
24411,2020-21,I have removed around 70 of them in the new simplified regime.
24412,2020-21,We will review and rationalise the remaining exemptions and deductions in the coming years with a view to further simplifying the tax system and lowering the tax rate.
24413,2020-21,"Currently, companies are required to pay Dividend Distribution Tax DDT on the dividend paid to its shareholders at the rate of 15% plus applicable surcharge and cess in addition to the tax payable by the company on its profits."
24414,2020-21,"In order to increase the attractiveness of the Indian Equity Market and to provide relief to a large class of investors, I propose to remove the DDT and adopt the classical system of dividend taxation under which the companies would not be required to pay DDT."
24415,2020-21,The dividend shall be taxed only in the hands of the recipients at their applicable rate.
24416,2020-21,"The removal of DDT will lead to estimated annual revenue forgone of ` 25,000 Crore."
24417,2020-21,This is another bold move which will further make India an attractive destination for investment.
24418,2020-21,Concessional tax rate for Electricity generation companies 
24419,2020-21,"In order to give boost to the manufacturing sector, new provisions were introduced in September 2019 offering a concessional corporate tax rate of 15% to the newly incorporated domestic companies in the manufacturing sector which start manufacturing by 31st March, 2023."
24420,2020-21,"In order to attract investment in power sector, I propose to extend the concessional corporate tax rate of 15% to new domestic companies engaged in the generation of electricity."
24421,2020-21,Tax concession for foreign investments 
24422,2020-21,"In order to incentivise the investment by the Sovereign Wealth Fund of foreign governments in the priority sectors, I propose to grant 100% tax exemption to their interest, dividend and capital gains income in respect of investment made in infrastructure and other 36 notified sectors before 31st March, 2024 and with a minimum lock in period of 3 years."
24423,2020-21,"In order to make available foreign funds at a lower cost, I propose to extend the period of concessional withholding rate of 5% under section 194LC for interest payment to nonresidents in respect of moneys borrowed and bonds issued up to 30th June, 2023."
24424,2020-21,"In order to incentivise listing of bonds at IFSC exchange, I propose to further reduce the withholding rate from 5% to 4% on interest payment on the bonds listed on its exchange."
24425,2020-21,Startups Startups have emerged as engines of growth for our economy.
24426,2020-21,"Over the past year, our Government has taken several measures to hand hold them and support their growth."
24427,2020-21,"During their formative years, Startups generally use Employee Stock Option Plan ESOP to attract and retain highly talented employees."
24428,2020-21,ESOP is a significant component of compensation for these employees.
24429,2020-21,"Currently, ESOPs are taxable as perquisites at the time of exercise."
24430,2020-21,This leads to cash flow problem for the employees who do not sell the shares immediately and continue to hold the same for the longterm.
24431,2020-21,"In order to give a boost to the startup ecosystem, I propose to ease the burden of taxation on the employees by deferring the tax payment by five years or till they leave the company or when they sell their shares, whichever is earliest."
24432,2020-21,"In order to extend this benefit to larger startups, I propose to increase the turnover limit from existing ` 25 crore to ` 100 crores."
24433,2020-21,"Moreover, considering the fact that in the initial years, a startup may not have adequate profit to avail this deduction, I propose to extend the period of eligibility for claim of deduction from the existing 7 years to 10 years."
24434,2020-21,"Concessional tax rate for Cooperatives  Cooperative societies play an extremely important role in our economy in facilitating access to credit, procurement of inputs and marketing of products to their members."
24435,2020-21,These cooperatives are currently taxed at a rate of 30% with surcharge and cess.
24436,2020-21,"As a major concession and in order to bring parity between the cooperative societies and corporates, I propose to provide an option to cooperative societies to be taxed at 22% plus 10% surcharge and 4% cess with no exemption/deductions."
24437,2020-21,"Further, I also propose to exempt these cooperative societies from Alternative Minimum Tax AMT just like companies under the new tax regime are exempted from the Minimum Alternate Tax MAT. 121."
24438,2020-21,"Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises MSME "
24439,2020-21,"Currently, businesses having turnover of more than one crore rupees are required to get their books of accounts audited by an accountant."
24440,2020-21,"In order to reduce the compliance burden on small retailers, traders, shopkeepers who comprise the MSME sector, I propose to raise by five times the turnover threshold for audit from the existing ` 1 crore to ` 5 crore."
24441,2020-21,"Further, in order to boost less cash economy, I propose that the increased limit shall apply only to those businesses which carry out less than 5% of their business transactions in cash."
24442,2020-21,"For realisation of the goal of ‘Housing for All’ and affordable housing, in the last budget I had announced an additional deduction 38 of up to one lakh fifty thousand rupees for interest paid on loans taken for purchase of an affordable house."
24443,2020-21,"The deduction was allowed on housing loans sanctioned on or before 31st March, 2020."
24444,2020-21,"In order to ensure that more persons avail this benefit and to further incentivise the affordable housing, I propose to extend the date of loan sanction for availing this additional deduction by one more year."
24445,2020-21,"In order to promote the affordable housing projects, I propose to extend the date of approval of affordable housing projects for availing this tax holiday by one more year."
24446,2020-21,Concession to real estate transactions 
24447,2020-21,"Currently, while taxing income from capital gains, business profits and other sources in respect of transactions in real estate, if the consideration value is less than circle rate by more than 5 percent, the difference is counted as income both in the hands of the purchaser and seller."
24448,2020-21,"In order to minimize hardship in real estate transaction and provide relief to the sector, I propose to increase the limit of 5% to 10%."
24449,2020-21,"Acknowledging the important role played by the charitable institutions in the society, the income of these institutions is fully exempt from taxation."
24450,2020-21,"Further, donation made to these institutions is also allowed as deduction in computing the taxable income of the donor."
24451,2020-21,"In order to ease the process of claiming deduction for donation, it is proposed to prefill the donee’s information in taxpayer’s return on the basis of information of donations furnished by the donee."
24452,2020-21,This 39 would result in hasslefree claim of deduction for the donation made by the taxpayer.
24453,2020-21,"In the past, the process of the registration was completely manual and scattered all over the country."
24454,2020-21,"In order to simplify the compliance for the new and existing charity institutions, I propose to make the process of registration completely electronic under which a unique registration number URN shall be issued to all new and existing charity institutions."
24455,2020-21,"Further, to facilitate the registration of the new charity institution which is yet to start their charitable activities, I propose to allow them provisional registration for three years."
24456,2020-21,Faceless appeals Our government is committed to bringing in transformational changes so that maximum governance is provided with minimum government.
24457,2020-21,"In order to impart greater efficiency, transparency and accountability to the assessment process, a new faceless assessment scheme has already been introduced."
24458,2020-21,"Currently, most of the functions of the Income Tax Department starting from the filing of return, processing of returns, issuance of refunds and assessment are performed in the electronic mode without any human interface."
24459,2020-21,"In order to take the reforms initiated by the Department to the next level and to eliminate human interface, I propose to amend the Income Tax Act so as to enable Faceless appeal on the lines of Faceless assessment."
24460,2020-21,"No Dispute but Trust Scheme – ‘Vivad Se Vishwas’Scheme  Sir, in the past our Government has taken several measures to reduce tax litigations."
24461,2020-21,"In the last budget, Sabka Vishwas Scheme was brought in to reduce litigation in indirect taxes."

24463,2020-21,"Currently, there are 4,83,000 direct tax cases pending in various appellate forums i.e. Commissioner Appeals, ITAT, High Court and Supreme Court."
24464,2020-21,"This year, I propose to bring a scheme similar to the indirect tax Sabka Vishwas for reducing litigations even in the direct taxes."
24465,2020-21,"Those who avail this scheme after 31st March, 2020 will have to pay some additional amount."
24466,2020-21,"The scheme will remain open till 30th June, 2020."
24467,2020-21,"As a part of consolidation of the financial sector, our Government has brought out schemes for merger and amalgamation of public sector banks."
24468,2020-21,"In order to ensure that the amalgamated entities are able to take the benefit of unabsorbed losses and depreciation of the amalgamating entities, I propose to make necessary amendments to the provisions of the Incometax Act."
24469,2020-21,Any tax system requires trust between taxpayers and the administration.
24470,2020-21,This will be possible only when taxpayer’s rights are clearly enumerated.
24471,2020-21,"Towards this end, and with the objective of enhancing the efficiency of the delivery system of the Income Tax Department, I propose to amend the provisions of the Income Tax Act to mandate the Central Board of Direct Taxes CBDT to adopt a Taxpayers’ Charter."
24472,2020-21,The details of the contents of the charter shall be notified soon.
24473,2020-21,"In the last Budget, I had introduced the interchangeability of PAN and Aadhaar for which necessary rules were already notified."
24474,2020-21,"In order to further ease the process of allotment of PAN, soon we will launch a system under which PAN shall be instantly allotted online on the basis of Aadhaar without any requirement for filling up of detailed application form."
24475,2020-21,Our Government brought in the GST as a historic reform of the indirect taxes in 2017.
24476,2020-21,"We also took a pathbreaking step of simplifying and rationalising corporate tax in September, 2019."
24477,2020-21,"More importantly, we offered a rate of corporate tax, which perhaps is the lowest in the world."
24478,2020-21,"Continuing on this path, we have now put the personal income tax at its lowest ever rate and totally removed DDT at the company’s hands."
24479,2020-21,"Further, the direct taxes are now the lowest, simplest, and smoothest."
24480,2020-21,Direct tax on the Startups also has seen many reformatory steps in quick succession.
24481,2020-21,Even ease of compliance is seeing unprecedented changes.
24482,2020-21,"Last but not the least, personal interface with tax administration is at the minimum ever."
24483,2020-21,"As I mentioned earlier in Part A of my speech, reforms are continuing in GST."
24484,2020-21,"A simplified return shall be implemented from the 1st April, 2020."
24485,2020-21,This is under pilot run.

24487,2020-21,Refund process has been simplified and has been made fully automated with no human interface.
24488,2020-21,Electronic invoice is another innovation wherein critical information shall be captured electronically in a centralized system.
24489,2020-21,It will be implemented in a phased manner starting from this month itself on optional basis.
24490,2020-21,It will facilitate compliance and return filing.
24491,2020-21,Several measures have been taken for improving compliance.
24492,2020-21,Aadhaar based verification of taxpayers is being introduced.
24493,2020-21,This will help in weeding out dummy or nonexistent units.
24494,2020-21,Dynamic QRcode is proposed for consumer invoices.
24495,2020-21,GST parameters will be captured when payment for purchases is made through the QRcode.
24496,2020-21,A system of cash reward is envisaged to incentivise customers to seek invoice.
24497,2020-21,"Deep data analytics and AI tools are being used for crackdown on GST input tax credit, refund, and other frauds and to identify all those who are trying to game the system."
24498,2020-21,Invoice and input tax credit matching is being done wherein returns having mismatch more than 10 percent or above a threshold are identified and pursued.
24499,2020-21,Significant policy level changes have also been made.
24500,2020-21,GST rate structure is also being deliberated so as to address issues like inverted duty structure.
24501,2020-21,"On Customs side, a number of measures have been taken for ease of doing business."
24502,2020-21,India’s quantum leap in the Trading Across Border parameter of Ease of Doing Business rankings by the World Bank is a testimony to these efforts.
24503,2020-21,India’s rank on this parameter improved from 146 to 80 in 2018 and further to 68 in 2019.
24504,2020-21,"Measures have also been taken for providing a level playing field to our domestic manufacturers, particularly the MSME sector and for securing borders."
24505,2020-21,It has been observed that imports under Free Trade Agreements FTAs are on the rise.
24506,2020-21,Undue claims of FTA benefits have posed threat to domestic industry.
24507,2020-21,Such imports require stringent checks.
24508,2020-21,"In this context, suitable provisions are being incorporated in the Customs Act."
24509,2020-21,"In the coming months we shall review Rules of Origin requirements, particularly for certain sensitive items, so as ensure that FTAs are aligned to the conscious direction of our policy."
24510,2020-21,We are also strengthening provisions relating to safeguard duties which are applied when surge in imports causes serious injury to domestic industry.
24511,2020-21,Amended provisions shall enable regulating such surge in imports in a systematic way.
24512,2020-21,The provisions for checking dumping of goods and imports of subsidized goods are also being strengthened for ensuring a level playing field for domestic industry.
24513,2020-21,These changes are in line with the international best practices.
24514,2020-21,Exemptions from customs duty have been given in public interest from time to time.
24515,2020-21,"However, a number of these have outlived their utility or have become outdated."
24516,2020-21,"On review, certain such exemptions are being withdrawn."
24517,2020-21,"Remaining custom duty exemptions shall be comprehensively reviewed by September, 2020 for taking a view on their relevance."
24518,2020-21,I propose to crowd source suggestions for such reviews.
24519,2020-21,Suggestions would also be invited in respect of the Customs laws and procedures for aligning them with the needs of changing times and ease of doing business.
24520,2020-21,Labour intensive sectors in MSME are critical for employment generation.
24521,2020-21,Cheap and lowquality imports are an impediment to their growth.
24522,2020-21,Special attention has been taken to put measured restraint on import of those items which are being produced by our MSMEs with better quality.
24523,2020-21,"Keeping in view the need of this sector, customs duty is being raised on items like footwear and furniture."
24524,2020-21,Our policy of Make in India has started giving dividends.
24525,2020-21,India is now making world class goods and exporting such products.
24526,2020-21,We have made considerable progress in medical equipment too.
24527,2020-21,Till few years back we 43 were dependent on imports for medical equipment.
24528,2020-21,"Now, not only we are manufacturing medical equipment but also exporting them in large quantities."
24529,2020-21,This sector deserves further fillip.
24530,2020-21,Government has also been committed to provide health services to all.
24531,2020-21,Ayushman Bharat has made it possible.
24532,2020-21,"To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic industry and also to generate resource for health services, I propose to impose a nominal health cess, by way of a duty of customs, on the imports of medical equipment keeping in view that these goods are now being made significantly in India."
24533,2020-21,The proceed from this cess shall be used for creating infrastructure for health services in the aspirational districts.
24534,2020-21,"Under Make in India initiative, well laid out customs duty rates were preannounced for items like mobile phones, electric vehicles and their components."
24535,2020-21,This has ensured gradual increase in domestic value addition capacity in India.
24536,2020-21,"Customs duty rates are being revised on electric vehicles, and parts of mobiles as part of such carefully conceived Phased Manufacturing Plans."
24537,2020-21,"In other changes, customs duty is being reduced on certain inputs and raw materials while it is being revised upward on certain goods which are being made domestically."
24538,2020-21,"In the previous budget, basic custom duty of 10% was imposed on the news print and lightweight coated paper."
24539,2020-21,"However, since then I have received several references that this levy has put additional burden on print media at a time when it is going through a difficult phase."
24540,2020-21,"I, therefore, propose to reduce basic customs duty on imports of news print and lightweight coated paper from 10% to 5%."
24541,2020-21,Chemicals are crucial feed stocks for downstream users.
24542,2020-21,"PTA, for example, is a critical input for textile fibres and yarns."
24543,2020-21,Its easy availability at competitive prices is desirable to unlock immense potential in textile sector which is a significant employment generator.
24544,2020-21,"Therefore, in the larger public interest, antidumping duty on PTA is being abolished."
24545,2020-21,"As a revenue measure, I propose to raise excise duty, by way of National Calamity Contingent Duty on Cigarettes and other tobacco products."
24546,2020-21,"However, no change is being made in the duty rates of bidis."
24547,2020-21,"Finally, continuing the tax reform is an ongoing challenge and we propose to pursue them with full vigour."
24548,2020-21,Details of my budget proposals relating to direct and indirect taxes are in the Annexure to my speech.
24549,2020-21,"Mr. Speaker Sir, with these words I commend the Budget to this august House."

24551,2021-22,"Honourable Speaker, the preparation of this Budget was undertaken in circumstances like never before."
24552,2021-22,"We knew of calamities that have affected a country or a region within a country, but what we have endured with COVID19 through 2020 is sui generis."
24553,2021-22,"When I presented the Budget 202021, we could not have imagined that the global economy, already in throes of a slowdown, would be pushed into an unprecedented contraction."
24554,2021-22,We could not have also imagined then that our people as those in other countries would have to endure the loss of near and dear ones and suffer hardships brought about due to a health crisis.
24555,2021-22,The risk of not having a lockdown was far too high.
24556,2021-22,"Within 48 hours of declaring a threeweeklong complete lockdown, the Prime Minister announced the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana, valued at `2.76 lakh crores – this provided, free food grain to 800 million people, free cooking gas for 80 million families for months, and cash directly to over 400 million farmers, women, elderly, the poor and the needy."
24557,2021-22,"Even as a large section of citizens stayed home, milk, vegetable, and fruitsuppliers, health and sanitary workers, truck drivers, railways and public transport workers, bank employees, electricity workers, our annadatas, police, firemen, and the armed forces, all had to go about their work as normal, but with the additional anxiety of the virus hanging over them."
24558,2021-22,"We recognise this, and I think I speak on behalf of everybody in this august House, when I express my heartfelt gratitude to these men and women, for how they were able to carry out their work and duty, to provide for the nation’s basics, over those crucial months."
24559,2021-22,"Speaker Sir, for public good, Honourable Members of Parliament and Members of Legislative Assemblies too offered their salaries."
24560,2021-22,"In May 2020, the government announced the AtmaNirbhar Bharat package ANB 1.0."
24561,2021-22,"To sustain the recovery, further into the year, we also rolled out two more AtmaNirbhar Bharat packages ANB 2.0 and ANB 3.0."
24562,2021-22,Total financial impact of all AtmaNirbhar Bharat packages including measures taken by RBI was estimated to about `27.1 lakh crores which amounts to more than 13% of GDP.
24563,2021-22,"As a government, we kept a watch on the situation and were proactive in our responses."
24564,2021-22,"The government, led by the Prime Minister, stretched its resources to deliver for most vulnerable sections of our society – the poorest of the poor, the Dalits, Tribals, the elderly, the migrant workers, and our children."
24565,2021-22,"The PMGKY, the three ANB packages, and announcements made later were like five minibudgets in themselves."
24566,2021-22,The AtmaNirbhar Packages accelerated our pace of structural reforms.
24567,2021-22,"Redefinition of MSMEs, Commercialisation of the Mineral Sector, Agriculture and Labour Reforms, Privatisation of Public Sector Undertakings, One Nation One Ration Card, and Production Linked Incentive Schemes are some of the notable reforms carried out during this period."
24568,2021-22,"Faceless Income Tax Assessment, DBT and Financial Inclusion are the others."

24933,2021-22,"I now seek to take further steps to simplify the tax administration, ease compliance, and reduce litigation.   "
24934,2021-22,I begin my direct tax proposals by offering my pranaam to our senior citizens.
24935,2021-22,"Many of them, despite having foregone several basic necessities of their own, have strived to build our nation."
24936,2021-22,"Now in the 75th year of Independence of our country, when we continue our endeavour with renewed vigour, we shall reduce compliance burden on our senior citizens who are 75 years of age and above."

24940,2021-22,"Honourable Speaker, presently, an assessment can be reopened up to 6 years and in serious tax fraud cases for up to 10 years."
24941,2021-22,"As a result, taxpayers have to remain under uncertainty for a long time."
24942,2021-22,I therefore propose to reduce this timelimit for reopening of assessment to 3 years from the present 6 years.
24943,2021-22,"In serious tax evasion cases too, only where there is evidence of concealment of income of `50 lakh or more in a year, can the assessment be reopened up to 10 years."
24944,2021-22,"Even this reopening can be done only after the approval of the Principal Chief Commissioner, the highest level of the Income Tax Department."

24946,2021-22,"Honourable Speaker, it has been the resolve of this Government to litigation, which mars the present taxation system."
24947,2021-22,The Government came out with the Direct Tax Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to give taxpayers an opportunity to settle long pending disputes and be relieved of further strain on their time and resources.
24948,2021-22,"The response from the taxpayers has been the best ever as over 1 lakh ten thousand taxpayers have already opted to settle tax disputes of over `85,000 crores under this Scheme."
24949,2021-22,"To further reduce litigation for small taxpayers, I propose to constitute a Dispute Resolution Committee for them, which will be faceless to ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability."
24950,2021-22,Anyone with a taxable income up to `50 lakh and disputed income up to `10 lakh shall be eligible to approach the Committee.
24951,2021-22,"For ease of compliance and to reduce discretion, we are committed to make the taxation processes faceless."
24952,2021-22,The Government has already introduced faceless assessment and appeal this year.

24954,2021-22,I now propose to make this Tribunal faceless.
24955,2021-22,We shall establish a National Faceless Income Tax Appellate Tribunal Centre.
24956,2021-22,All communication between the Tribunal and the appellant shall be electronic.
24957,2021-22,"Where personal hearing is needed, it shall be done through videoconferencing."
24958,2021-22,"When NonResident Indians return to India, they have issues with respect to their accrued incomes in their foreign retirement accounts."
24959,2021-22,This is usually due to a mismatch in taxation periods.
24960,2021-22,They also face difficulties in getting credit for Indian taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

24965,2021-22,"In the previous Budget, I had abolished the Dividend Distribution Tax DDT in order to incentivise investment."
24966,2021-22,Dividend was made taxable in the 31 hands of shareholders.
24967,2021-22,"Now, in order to provide ease of compliance, I propose to make dividend payment to REIT/ InvIT exempt from TDS."
24968,2021-22,"Further, as the amount of dividend income cannot be estimated correctly by the shareholders for paying advance tax, I propose to provide that advance tax liability on dividend income shall arise only after the declaration/payment of dividend."

24970,2021-22,Attracting foreign investment into infrastructure sector 163.
24971,2021-22,"In the last budget, for attracting foreign investment in the infrastructure sector, we had granted 100% tax exemption, subject to certain conditions, to foreign Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds, on their income from investment in Indian infrastructure."
24972,2021-22,We have noticed that few of such Funds are facing difficulties in meeting some of these conditions.
24973,2021-22,"In order to ensure that a large number of Funds invest in India, I propose to relax some of these conditions relating to prohibition on private funding, restriction on commercial activities, and direct investment in infrastructure."

24978,2021-22,"I propose to extend the eligibility of this deduction by one more year, to 31st March 2022."
24979,2021-22,"The additional deduction of `1.5 lakh shall therefore be available for loans taken up till 31st March 2022, for the purchase of an affordable house."

24991,2021-22,I now propose to increase this amount to `5 crore.
24992,2021-22,"We have noticed that some employers deduct the contribution of employees towards Provident funds, superannuation funds, and other social security funds but do not deposit these contributions within the specified time."
24993,2021-22,"For the employees, this means a loss of interest or income."
24994,2021-22,"In cases where an employer later becomes financially unviable, nondeposit results in a permanent loss for the employees."
24995,2021-22,"In order to ensure that employees’ contributions are deposited on time, I reiterate that the late deposit of employee’s contribution by the employer will not be allowed as deduction to the employer."

25399,2022-23,Tax relief to persons with disability 126.
25400,2022-23,The parent or guardian of a differently abled person can take an insurance scheme for such person.
25401,2022-23,The present law provides for deduction to the parent or guardian only if the lump sum payment or annuity is available to the differently abled person on the death of the subscriber i.e. parent or guardian.
25402,2022-23,There could be situations where differently abled dependants may need payment of annuity or lump sum amount even during the lifetime of their parents/guardians.

25407,2022-23,"However, such deduction is allowed only to the extent of 10 per cent of the salary in case of employees of the State government."
25408,2022-23,"To provide equal treatment to both Central and State government employees, I propose to increase the tax deduction limit from 10 per cent to 14 per cent on employer’s contribution to the NPS account of State Government employees as well."
25409,2022-23,This would help in enhancing the social security benefits of the state government employees and bring them at par with central government employees.

25421,2022-23,No deduction in respect of any expenditure or allowance shall be allowed while computing such income except cost of acquisition.

25453,2022-23,There are still some challenges remaining and we aspire to meet them in the coming year.

25456,2022-23,Taxpayers deserve applause for this growth.

25463,2022-23,Customs Reforms and duty rate changes 141.
25464,2022-23,Customs administration has reinvented itself over the years through liberalised procedures and infusion of technology.
25465,2022-23,Faceless Customs has been fully established.

25467,2022-23,"Customs’ reforms have played a very vital role in domestic capacity creation, providing level playing field to our MSMEs, easing the raw material supply side constraints, enhancing ease of doing business and being an enabler to other policy initiatives such as PLIs and Phased Manufacturing Plans."
25468,2022-23,My proposals on customs side are aligned to these objectives.
25469,2022-23,Project imports and capital goods 142.
25470,2022-23,"National Capital Goods Policy, 2016 aims at doubling the production of capital goods by 2025."
25471,2022-23,This would create employment opportunities and result in increased economic activity.
25472,2022-23,"However, several duty exemptions, even extending to over three decades in some cases, have been granted to capital goods for various sectors like power, fertilizer, textiles, leather, footwear, food processing and fertilizers."
25473,2022-23,These exemptions have hindered the growth of the domestic capital goods sector.
25474,2022-23,"Similarly, project import duty concessions have also deprived the local producers of a level playing field in areas like coal mining projects, power generation, transmission or distribution projects, railway and metro projects."
25475,2022-23,Our experience suggests that reasonable tariffs are conducive to the growth of domestic industry and ‘Make in India’ without significantly impacting the cost of essential imports.
25476,2022-23,"Accordingly, it is proposed to phase out the concessional rates in capital goods and project imports gradually and apply a moderate tariff of 7.5 per cent."
25477,2022-23,Certain exemptions for advanced machineries that are not manufactured within the country shall continue.

25482,2022-23,"These include exemption on certain agricultural produce, chemicals, fabrics, medical devices and drugs and medicines for which sufficient domestic capacity exists."
25483,2022-23,"Further, as a simplification measure, several concessional rates are being incorporated in the Customs Tariff Schedule itself instead of prescribing them through various notifications."
25484,2022-23,"This comprehensive review will simplify the Customs rate and tariff structure particularly for sectors like chemicals, textiles and metals and minimise disputes."
25485,2022-23,Removal of exemption on items which are or can be manufactured in India and providing concessional duties on raw material that go into manufacturing of intermediate products will go many a step forward in achieving our objective of ‘Make in India’ and ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’.
25486,2022-23,I shall now take up sector specific proposals.

25860,2023-24,I propose to increase the rebate limit to ` 7 lakh in the new tax regime.
25861,2023-24,"Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ` 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax."
25862,2023-24,The second proposal relates to middleclass individuals.
25863,2023-24,"I had introduced, in the year 2020, the new personal income tax regime with six income slabs starting from ` 2.5 lakh."
25864,2023-24,I propose to change the tax structure in this regime by reducing the number of slabs to five and increasing the tax exemption limit to ` 3 lakh.
25865,2023-24,The new tax rates are: ` 03 lakh Nil ` 36 lakh 5 per cent ` 69 lakh 10 per cent ` 912 lakh 15 per cent ` 1215 lakh 20 per cent Above ` 15 lakh 30 per cent 148.
25866,2023-24,This will provide major relief to all tax payers in the new regime.
25867,2023-24,"An individual with an annual income of ` 9 lakh will be required to pay only ` 45,000/. This is only 5 per cent of his or her income."
25868,2023-24,"It is a reduction of 25 per cent on what he or she is required to pay now, ie, ` 60,000/. Similarly, an individual with an income of ` 15 lakh would be required to pay only ` 1.5 lakh or 10 per cent of his or her income, a reduction of 20 per cent from the existing liability of ` 1,87,500/. 149."
25869,2023-24,"My third proposal is for the salaried class and the pensioners including family pensioners, for whom I propose to extend the benefit of 34 standard deduction to the new tax regime."
25870,2023-24,"Each salaried person with an income of ` 15.5 lakh or more will thus stand to benefit by ` 52,500. 150."

25872,2023-24,This is among the highest in the world.
25873,2023-24,I propose to reduce the highest surcharge rate from 37 per cent to 25 per cent in the new tax regime.
25874,2023-24,This would result in reduction of the maximum tax rate to 39 per cent.
25875,2023-24,"Lastly, the limit of ` 3 lakh for tax exemption on leave encashment on retirement of nongovernment salaried employees was last fixed in the year 2002, when the highest basic pay in the government was ` 30,000/ pm."
25876,2023-24,"In line with the increase in government salaries, I am proposing to increase this limit to ` 25 lakh."
25877,2023-24,We are also making the new income tax regime as the default tax regime.
25878,2023-24,"However, citizens will continue to have the option to avail the benefit of the old tax regime."
25879,2023-24,"Apart from these, I am also making some other changes as given in the annexure."
